<h2>
FOREWORD
</h2>

<p>
There is no domestic problem in America which has given thoughtful men
more concern than the problem of the relations between the white and the
Negro races. In earlier days the colonization of the Negro, as in Liberia, was
put forward as a solution. That idea was abandoned long ago. It is now
recognized generally that the two races are here in America to stay.
</p>

<p>
It is also certain that the problem will not be solved by methods of violence.
Every race riot, every instance in which men of either race defy legal authority
and take the law into their own hands, but postpones the day when the two
races shall live together amicably. The law must be maintained and enforced
vigorously and completely before any real progress can be made towards
better race relations.
</p>

<p>
Means must be found, therefore, whereby the two races can live together
on terms of amity. This will be possible only if the two races are brought to
understand each other better. It is believed that such understanding will
result in each having a higher degree of respect for the other, and that such
respect will form the basis for greatly improved relations between the races.
</p>

<p>
The Commission on Race Relations, composed of distinguished representatives
of both races, has made the most thorough and complete survey of the
race situation that I have seen anywhere. While its field of study was necessarily
limited to Chicago, the conditions there may be regarded as fairly
typical of conditions in other large cities where there is a large colored population.
</p>

<p>
The report does not pretend to have discovered any new formula by which
all race trouble will disappear. The subject is too complex for any such simple
solution. It finds certain facts, however, the mere recognition of which will
go a long way towards allaying race feeling. It finds that in that portion of
Chicago in which colored persons have lived longest and in the largest numbers
relatively there has been the minimum of friction. This is a fact of the first
importance. For it tends to show that the presence of Negroes in large
numbers in our great cities is not a menace in itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xiv' name='Page_xiv' href='#Page_xiv'>xiv</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There is one recommendation (No. 31) to which I desire to call special
attention: that a permanent local commission on race relations be created.
When as Governor of Illinois I withdrew troops from Chicago after the riots,
I was not at all persuaded that all danger of their recurrence was past. I kept
observers from the Adjutant General's office on the ground to watch for any
signs of fresh trouble. The Commission on Race Relations was appointed,
and conditions at once began to improve. The activities of this Commission,
composed of the best representatives of both races, were, as I believe, the
principal cause for this improved condition.
</p>

<p>
Causes of friction, insignificant in themselves, but capable of leading to
serious results, were discovered by the Commission and by its suggestion were
removed in time to avoid grave consequences. Gross exaggerations of some
fancied grievance by either the one race or the other were examined into and
were found to rest upon nothing else than idle rumor or prejudice. In the light
of truth which the Commission was able to throw upon the subject, these grievances
disappeared. In other words, misunderstanding, which had been so
prolific a source of trouble between the races, was greatly reduced.
</p>

<p>
The report contains recommendations, which, if acted upon, will make
impossible, in my opinion, a repetition of the appalling tragedy which brought
disgrace to Chicago in July of 1919.
</p>

<p>
Men may differ as to some of the conclusions reached, but all fair-minded
men must admit, I think, that the report of the Commission on Race Relations
is a most important contribution to this important subject.

<h2>
INTRODUCTION
</h2>

<p>
On Sunday, July 27, 1919, there was a clash of white people and Negroes
at a bathing-beach in Chicago, which resulted in the drowning of a Negro boy.
This led to a race riot in which thirty-eight lives were lostâ€”twenty-three
Negroes and fifteen whitesâ€”and 537 persons were injured. After three days
of mob violence, affecting several sections of the city, the state militia was
called out to assist the police in restoring order. It was not until August 6
that danger of further clashes was regarded as past.
</p>

<p>
To discuss this serious situation and means of preventing its recurrence,
a group of eighty-one citizens, representing forty-eight social, civic, commercial,
and professional organizations of Chicago, met on August 1, 1919,
at the Union League Club. Mr. Charles W. Folds, president of the Club,
presided. Brief addresses were made by Mr. H. H. Merrick, president of the
Chicago Association of Commerce, Dr. Graham Taylor, Miss Harriet Vittum,
Major John S. Bonner, Mr. Charles J. Boyd, and Rev. William C. Covert.
</p>

<p>
Resolutions were passed and given to the press, and the following letter
to the Governor of Illinois was authorized:

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: A meeting was held today at the Union League Club to take up the
matter of the present race riots.
</p>

<p>
This meeting was attended by 81 representatives of 48 prominent civic, professional
and commercial organizations, such as Chicago Medical Association, Chicago
Bar Association, Federation of Churches, Association of Commerce, Packing House
Industries, Urban League, Woman's City Club, Chicago Woman's Club, Foreign
Language Division, representing foreign-born population, etc.
</p>

<p>
A resolution was adopted unanimously, appointing the undersigned as a committee
to wait upon you and ask that you appoint at your earliest convenience an
emergency state committee to study the psychological, social and economic causes
underlying the conditions resulting in the present race riot and to make such recommendations
as will tend to prevent a recurrence of such conditions in the future.
</p>

<p>
The committee would welcome an opportunity to meet you at any time convenient
to yourself and to talk over with you details and give you such information as has
been gathered through these various organizations.

</p>

<p>
In response to this and other urgent requests by various citizens and
organizations, and pursuant to his personal knowledge of the situation derived
from investigations made by him in Chicago during the period of the riot,
Governor Lowden announced on August 20, 1919, the appointment of a
Commission on Race Relations, consisting of twelve members, six from each
race, as followsâ€”Mr. Bancroft being designated by him as chairman:
</p>

<p>
Representing the white people: Edgar A. Bancroft, William Scott Bond,
Edward Osgood Brown, Harry Eugene Kelly, Victor F. Lawson, Julius Rosenwald.
</p>

<p>
Representing the Negro people: Robert S. Abbott, George Cleveland
Hall, George H. Jackson, Edward H. Morris, Adelbert H. Roberts, Lacey
Kirk Williams.<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
In announcing the appointment of this Commission, Governor Lowden
made public the following statement:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have been requested by many citizens and by many civic organizations in
Chicago to appoint a Commission to study and report upon the broad question of
the relations between the two races. These riots were the work of the worst element
of both races. They did not represent the great overwhelming majority of either race.
The two are here and will remain here. The great majority of each realizes the
necessity of their living upon terms of cordial good will and respect, each for the other.
That condition must be brought about.
</p>

<p>
To say that we cannot solve this problem is to confess the failure of self-government.
I offer no solution of the problem. I do know, however, that the
question cannot be answered by mob violence. I do know that every time men,
white or colored, take the law into their own hands, instead of helping they only
postpone the settlement of the question. When we admit the existence of a problem
and courageously face it, we have gone half-way toward its solution.
</p>

<p>
I have with the utmost care, in response to the requests above set forth, appointed
a Commission to undertake this great work. I have sought only the most representative
men of the two races. I have not even asked them whether they had views as
to how the question could be met. I have asked them only to approach the difficult
subject with an open mind, and in a spirit of fairness and justice to all. This is a
tribunal that has been constituted to get the facts and interpret them and to find a
way out. I believe that great good can come out of the work of this Commission.
</p>

<p>
I ask that our people, white and colored, give their fullest co-operation to the
Commission. I ask, too, as I have a right to ask, that both races exercise that
patience and self-restraint which are indispensable to self-government while we are
working out this problem.
</p>
</div>

<p>
During an absence of the chairman, due to ill health, Governor Lowden
requested Dr. Francis W. Shepardson, director of the State Department of
Registration and Education, to serve as acting chairman. On Mr. Bancroft's
return and at the Commission's request, the Governor appointed
Dr. Shepardson a member and vice-chairman of the Commission.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xvii' name='Page_xvii' href='#Page_xvii'>xvii</a></span>
The Commission's first meeting was held on October 9, 1919. Nine other
meetings were held during the remainder of that year to canvass the possible
fields of inquiry, and to provide for the organization of studies and investigations.
</p>

<p>
The Commission was seriously handicapped at the outset by a complete
lack of funds. The legislative session of 1919 had ended before the riot, and
the next regular session was not to convene until January, 1921. The Commission
felt that it could not with propriety seek to raise funds on its own
appeal. To meet this situation a group of citizens offered to serve as a
co-operating committee to finance the Commission's inquiry and the preparation
and publication of its report. This Committee, consisting of Messrs.
James B. Forgan, chairman, Abel Davis, treasurer, Arthur Meeker, John J.
Mitchell, and John G. Shedd, gave effective aid, being most actively assisted
by Messrs. R. B. Beach and John F. Bowman, of the staff of the Chicago
Association of Commerce. Without the co-operation of these gentlemen and
the resulting financial assistance of many generous contributors the Commission
could not have carried on its work. It here expresses its most grateful
appreciation.
</p>

<p>
The Commission organized its staff, inviting Mr. Graham Romeyn Taylor,
as executive secretary, and Mr. Charles S. Johnson, as associate executive
secretary, to assume charge of the inquiries and investigations under its
direction. They began their work on December 7, 1919.
</p>

<p>
While the Commission recognized the importance of studying the facts
of the riot, it felt that even greater emphasis should be placed on the study
and interpretation of the conditions of Negro life in Chicago and of the relations
between the two races. Therefore, after a brief survey of the data already
collected and of the broad field for its inquiries, it organized into six committees,
as follows: Committee on Racial Clashes, Committee on Housing,
Committee on Industry, Committee on Crime, Committee on Racial Contacts,
Committee on Public Opinion.
</p>

<p>
Along all these lines of inquiry information was sought in two general ways:
through a series of conferences or informal hearings, and through research
and field work carried on by a staff of trained investigators, white and Negro.
Thus both races were represented in the membership of the Commission,
in its executive secretaries, and in the field and office staff organized by the
executive secretaries.
</p>

<p>
It is not without significance that in securing office quarters the Commission
found several agents of buildings who declined to make a lease when
they learned that Negroes as well as whites were among the prospective
tenants. They stated their objections as based, not upon their own prejudices,
but upon the fear that other tenants would resent the presence of Negroes.
Office space at 118 North La Salle Street was leased to the Commission by the
L. J. McCormick estate, beginning February 1, 1920. When these offices
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xviii' name='Page_xviii' href='#Page_xviii'>xviii</a></span>
were vacated, May 1, 1921, the agents of the estate informed the Commission
that no tenant of the building had complained of the presence of Negroes.
</p>

<p>
By March 1, 1920, the staff of investigators had been organized and was
at work. The personnel was recruited as far as possible from social workers
of both races whose training and experience had fitted them for intelligent
and sympathetic handling of research and field work along the lines mapped
out by the Commission.<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
The period of investigations and conferences or informal hearings lasted
until November, 1920. The work of compiling material and writing the
various sections of the report had begun in October, 1920. Including its
business meetings and thirty conferences the Commission held more than
seventy-five meetings; forty of these were devoted to the consideration of
the text of the report.
</p>

<p>
The executive secretaries with their staff collected the materials during
1920, and soon after presented the first draft of a report. This was considered
and discussed by the Commission in numerous sessions, and the general outlines
of the report were decided upon. Then a second draft, in accordance
with its directions, was prepared by subjects, and a copy was submitted to
each member of the Commission for suggestions and criticisms. Afterward
the Commission met and discussed the questions raised by the different
members, and determined upon the changes to be made in substance and form.
After the entire report had been thus revised, the Commission in many conferences
decided what recommendations to make. These recommendations,
with a summary of the report, were then prepared, and were reviewed by the
Commission after they had been sent to each member. After full consideration
they were further revised and then adopted by the Commission. In all these
conferences upon the report, all of the Commissioners, with one exception,
conferred frequently and agreed unanimously. Mr. Morris, on account of
his duties as a member of the Constitutional Convention, did not attend any
of these conferences upon the report, summary, or recommendations, and
does not concur in them.
</p>

<p>
The Commission received the cordial assistance of many agencies, organizations,
and individuals. The Chicago Urban League placed at its disposal a
large amount of material from its files. It also gave a leave of absence to
the head of its Department of Research and Investigation, Mr. Charles S.
Johnson, the Commission's associate executive secretary. Many citizens,
representing widely divergent lines of interest, who were invited to attend
conferences held by the Commission, gave most generously of their time and
knowledge. The L. J. McCormick estate donated three months' office rent.
Messrs. George C. Nimmons &amp; Company, architects, contributed valuable
services, including study and supervision by Frederick Jehnck of their office,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xix' name='Page_xix' href='#Page_xix'>xix</a></span>
in preparing maps and charts designed to present most effectively data collected
by the Commission. The Federal Bureau of the Census made available
advanced data from the 1920-21 censuses. Superintendent Peter A. Mortensen
and many principals and teachers in the Chicago public schools co-operated
in the extensive studies of race relations in the schools; and the Committee of
Fifteen provided a report showing important facts in the study of environment
and crime. The various park boards, many municipal, county, and state
officials, superintendents and others connected with industrial plants, trades-union
officers, and leaders in many civic and social agencies greatly facilitated
investigations in their respective fields. To all these the Commission returns
sincere thanks. But, perhaps, the greatest debt of gratitude is due Mr.
Ernest S. Simpson, who generously and devotedly gave his spare time for
many months to the editing of this report.

The Commission's letter to Governor Lowden summarizing its work, and
his answer follow:

<p>
<i>Honorable Frank O. Lowden</i><br />
<i>Governor of Illinois</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Following the race riot in Chicago in July and August, 1919, in which
fifteen white people and twenty-three Negroes were killed and very many of both
races were injured, you appointed us as a Commission on Race Relations "to study
and report upon the broad question of the relations between the two races." We
have completed the investigations planned as a basis for this study, and are now
preparing a final report of our findings, conclusions and recommendations. This
report will soon be ready.
</p>

<p>
The Commission began its work in October, 1919, and for eleven months has
had a staff of investigators assisting it in its activities. While devoting much effort
to the study of the Chicago riot as presenting many phases of the race problem, the
Commission has placed greater emphasis upon the study of the conditions of life of
the Negro group in this community, and of the broad questions of race relations.
It therefore organized itself into six committees on the following subjects: Racial
Clashes, Housing, Industry, Crime, Racial Contacts, and Public Opinion.
</p>

<p>
In these fields the Commission's work has been done along two main lines:
</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) a series of conferences, at which persons believed to have special information
and experience relating to these subjects have been invited to give the Commission
the benefit of their knowledge and opinions;
</p>

<p>
(<i>b</i>) research and field work by a trained staff of investigators, both white and
Negro, to determine as accurately as possible, from first-hand evidence, the actual
conditions in the above fields.
</p>

<p>
The series of conferences, numbering thirty, covered a wide range of topics, such
as: the race riot of 1919 as viewed by the police, the militia, the grand jury, and state's
attorney; race friction and its remedies; contacts of whites and Negroes in public
schools and recreation places; special educational problems of Negro children; Negro
housing, its needs, type, and financing, and its difficulties in mixed areas; Negro
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xx' name='Page_xx' href='#Page_xx'>xx</a></span>
labor in relation to employers, fellow-workers, and trade unions; Negro women in
industry; the Negro and social agencies; Negro health; Negroes and whites in the
courts and in correctional institutions; and the Negro and white press in relation to
public opinion on race relations.
</p>

<p>
Of two hundred and sixty-three persons invited, one hundred and seventy-five
attended these conferences and presented their information and views. They
represented both races and various groups and viewpoints; they included educators
and teachers, real estate men, bankers, managers of industrial plants, housing experts,
trades-union leaders, social workers, physicians, park and playground directors,
judges, clergymen, superintendents of correctional and other institutions, police,
militia, and other public officials, and newspaper editors.
</p>

<p>
The research and field work done by the staff of investigators covered in general
the same broad range. The character is indicated by a bare outline of the work in
the six main fields:
</p>

<p>
Racial Clashes: 1919 Chicago riot, seventeen antecedent clashes; three minor
clashes in 1920; brief comparative study of Springfield riot in 1908 and East St.
Louis riot in 1917.
</p>

<p>
Racial Contacts: In schools, transportation lines, parks, and other recreation
places; contacts in mixed neighborhoods; adjustment of southern Negro families
coming to Chicago; survey of Negro agencies and institutions.
</p>

<p>
Housing: Negro areas in Chicago and their expansion 1910-1920; 274 family
histories showing housing experience, home life, and social back-ground, including
families from the South; 159 blocks covered in neighborhood survey; financing
Negro housing; depreciation in and near Negro areas; 52 house bombings, 1917-1920.
</p>

<p>
Industry: Data covering 22,448 Negroes in 192 plants; 101 plants visited;
quality of Negro labor; the widening opportunities and chance for promotion studied;
special study of trades unions and the Negro worker.
</p>

<p>
Crime: Police statistics of arrests and convictions of Negroes and selected
nationalities compared and analyzed for six years<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>; also juvenile court cases; 698
cases (one month) in three police courts studied, including detailed social data on
Negro cases; also 249 sex cases (two years) in criminal court; record of eleven penal
institutions; environmental survey of Negro areas.
</p>

<p>
Public Opinion: Files of white and Negro newspapers studied to analyze handling
of matters relating to race relations; study of rumor and its effects, and of racial
propaganda of white and Negro organizations.
</p>

<p>
We believe that the large volume of information collected will prove, when
properly set forth, of great value not only in Chicago but in other communities
where public-spirited citizens are endeavoring to establish right relations between
the two races. This end can be attained only through a more intelligent appreciation
by both races of the gravity of the problem, and by their earnest efforts toward a
better mutual understanding and a more sympathetic co-operation.
</p>

<p>
Hoping that our appreciation of the trust you have reposed in us may appear
in some measure in the aid our report may give toward working out better race
relations, we are,

<h2>
THE PROBLEM
</h2>

<p>
The relation of whites and Negroes in the United States is our most grave
and perplexing domestic problem. It involves not only a difference of raceâ€”which
as to many immigrant races has been happily overcomeâ€”but wider
and more manifest differences in color and physical features. These make
an easy and natural basis for distinctions, discriminations, and antipathies
arising from the instinct of each race to preserve its type. Many white
Americans, while technically recognizing Negroes as citizens, cannot bring
themselves to feel that they should participate in government as freely as
other citizens.
</p>

<p>
Countless schemes have been proposed for solving or dismissing this
problem, most of them impracticable or impossible. Of this class are such
proposals as: (1) the deportation of 12,000,000 Negroes to Africa; (2) the
establishment of a separate Negro state in the United States; (3) complete
separation and segregation from the whites and the establishment of a caste
system or peasant class; and (4) hope for a solution through the dying out
of the Negro race. The only effect of such proposals is to confuse thinking
on the vital issues involved and to foster impatience and intolerance.
</p>

<p>
Our race problem must be solved in harmony with the fundamental law
of the nation and with its free institutions. These prevent any deportation
of the Negro, as well as any restriction of his freedom of movement within
the United States. The problem must not be regarded as sectional or political,
and it should be studied and discussed seriously, frankly, and with an open mind.
</p>

<p>
It is important for our white citizens always to remember that the Negroes
alone of all our immigrants came to America against their will by the special
compelling invitation of the whites; that the institution of slavery was introduced,
expanded, and maintained in the United States by the white people
and for their own benefit; and that they likewise created the conditions that
followed emancipation.
</p>

<p>
Our Negro problem, therefore, is not of the Negro's making. No group
in our population is less responsible for its existence. But every group is
responsible for its continuance; and every citizen, regardless of color or racial
origin, is in honor and conscience bound to seek and forward its solution.
</p>

<p>
Centuries of the Negro slave trade and of slavery as an institution have
created, and are often deemed to justify, the deep-seated prejudice against
Negroes. They placed a stamp upon the relations of the two races which it
will require many years to erase. The memory of these relations has profoundly
affected and still affects the industrial, commercial, and social life
of the southern states.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xxiv' name='Page_xxiv' href='#Page_xxiv'>xxiv</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The great body of anti-Negro public opinion, preserved in the literature
and traditions of the white race during the long, unhappy progress of the
Negro from savagery through slavery to citizenship, has exercised a persistent
and powerful effect, both conscious and unconscious, upon the thinking and
the behavior of the white group generally. Racial misunderstanding has been
fostered by the ignorance and indifference of many white citizens concerning
the marvelous industry and courage shown by the Negroes and the success
they have achieved in their fifty-nine years of freedom.
</p>

<p>
The Negro race must develop, as all races have developed, from lower to
higher planes of living; and must base its progress upon industry, efficiency,
and moral character. Training along these lines and general opportunities
for education are the fundamental needs. As the problem is national in its
scope and gravity, the solution must be national. And the nation must make
sure that the Negro is educated for citizenship.
</p>

<p>
It is of the first importance that old prejudices against the Negroes, based
upon their misfortunes and not on their faults, be supplanted with respect,
encouragement, and co-operation, and with a recognition of their heroic
struggles for self-improvement and of their worthy achievements as loyal
American citizens.
</p>

<p>
Both races need to understand that their rights and duties are mutual
and equal, and that their interests in the common good are identical; that
relations of amity are the only protection against race clashes; that these
relations cannot be forced, but will come naturally as the leaders of each
race develop within their own ranks a realization of the gravity of this
problem and a vital interest in its solution, and an attitude of confidence,
respect, and friendliness toward the people of the other race.
</p>

<p>
All our citizens, regardless of color or racial origin, need to be taught by
their leaders that there is a common standard of superiority for them all in
self-respect, honesty, industry, fairness, forbearance, and above all, in generous
helpfulness. There is no help or healing in appraising past responsibilities,
or in present apportioning of praise or blame. The past is of value only as
it aids in understanding the present; and an understanding of the facts of
the problemâ€”a magnanimous understanding by both racesâ€”is the first step
toward its solution.

CHAPTER I
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE CHICAGO RIOT</span>
<br />
<span class="smcap s08">July 27-August 2, 1919</span>
</h2>

<p>
Thirty-eight persons killed, 537 injured, and about 1,000 rendered homeless
and destitute was the casualty list of the race riot which broke out in Chicago
on July 27, 1919, and swept uncontrolled through parts of the city for four
days. By August 2 it had yielded to the forces of law and order, and on
August 8 the state militia withdrew.
</p>

<p>
A clash between whites and Negroes on the shore of Lake Michigan at
Twenty-ninth Street, which involved much stone-throwing and resulted in
the drowning of a Negro boy, was the beginning of the riot. A policeman's
refusal to arrest a white man accused by Negroes of stoning the Negro boy was
an important factor in starting mob action. Within two hours the riot was
in full sway, had scored its second fatality, and was spreading throughout
the south and southwest parts of the city. Before the end came it reached
out to a section of the West Side and even invaded the "Loop," the heart of
Chicago's downtown business district. Of the thirty-eight killed, fifteen
were whites and twenty-three Negroes; of 537 injured, 178 were whites, 342
were Negroes, and the race of seventeen was not recorded.
</p>

<p>
In contrast with many other outbreaks of violence over racial friction
the Chicago riot was not preceded by excitement over reports of attacks on
women or of any other crimes alleged to have been committed by Negroes.
It is interesting to note that not one of the thirty-eight deaths was of a woman
or girl, and that only ten of the 537 persons injured were women or girls.
In further contrast with other outbreaks of racial violence, the Chicago riot
was marked by no hangings or burnings.
</p>

<p>
The rioting was characterized by much activity on the part of gangs of
hoodlums, and the clashes developed from sudden and spontaneous assaults
into organized raids against life and property.
</p>

<p>
In handling the emergency and restoring order, the police were effectively
reinforced by the state militia. Help was also rendered by deputy sheriffs,
and by ex-soldiers who volunteered.
</p>

<p>
In nine of the thirty-eight cases of death, indictments for murder were
voted by the grand jury, and in the ensuing trials there were four convictions.
In fifteen other cases the coroner's jury recommended that unknown members
of mobs be apprehended, but none of these was ever found.
</p>

<p>
The conditions underlying the Chicago riot are discussed in detail in other
sections of this report, especially in those which deal with housing, industry,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
and racial contacts. The Commission's inquiry concerning the facts of the
riot included a critical analysis of the 5,584 pages of the testimony taken by
the coroner's jury; a study of the records of the office of the state's attorney;
studies of the records of the Police Department, hospitals, and other institutions
with reference to injuries, and of the records of the Fire Department with
reference to incendiary fires; and interviews with many public officials and
citizens having special knowledge of various phases of the riot. Much information
was also gained by the Commission in a series of four conferences to which
it invited the foreman of the riot grand jury, the chief and other commanding
officers of the Police Department, the state's attorney and some of his assistants,
and officers in command of the state militia during the riot.
</p>

<p>
<i>Background of the riot.</i>â€”The Chicago riot was not the only serious outbreak
of interracial violence in the year following the war. The same summer
witnessed the riot in Washington, about a week earlier; the riot in Omaha,
about a month later; and then the week of armed conflict in a rural district
of Arkansas due to exploitation of Negro cotton producers.
</p>

<p>
Nor was the Chicago riot the first violent manifestation of race antagonism
in Illinois. In 1908 Springfield had been the scene of an outbreak that brought
shame to the community which boasted of having been Lincoln's home. In
1917 East St. Louis was torn by a bitter and destructive riot which raged
for nearly a week, and was the subject of a Congressional investigation that
disclosed appalling underlying conditions.
</p>

<p>
This Commission, while making a thorough study of the Chicago riot,
has reviewed briefly, for comparative purposes, the essential facts of the
Springfield and East St. Louis riots, and of minor clashes in Chicago occurring
both before and after the riot of 1919.
</p>

<p>
Chicago was one of the northern cities most largely affected by the migration
of Negroes from the South during the war. The Negro population
increased from 44,103 in 1910 to 109,594 in 1920, an increase of 148 per cent.
Most of this increase came in the years 1916-19. It was principally caused
by the widening of industrial opportunities due to the entrance of northern
workers into the army and to the demand for war workers at much higher
wages than Negroes had been able to earn in the South. An added factor was
the feeling, which spread like a contagion through the South, that the great
opportunity had come to escape from what they felt to be a land of discrimination
and subserviency to places where they could expect fair treatment and
equal rights. Chicago became to the southern Negro the "top of the world."
</p>

<p>
The effect of this influx of Negroes into Chicago industries is reviewed in
another section of this report.<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> It is necessary to point out here only that friction
in industry was less than might have been expected. There had been a
few strikes which had given the Negro the name of "strike breaker." But
the demand for labor was such that there were plenty of jobs to absorb all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
white and Negro workers available. This condition continued even after
the end of the war and demobilization.
</p>

<p>
In housing, however, there was a different story. Practically no new
building had been done in the city during the war, and it was a physical impossibility
for a doubled Negro population to live in the space occupied in 1915.
Negroes spread out of what had been known as the "Black Belt" into neighborhoods
near-by which had been exclusively white. This movement, as described
in another section of this report, developed friction, so much so that in the
"invaded" neighborhoods bombs were thrown at the houses of Negroes who
had moved in, and of real estate men, white and Negro, who sold or rented
property to the newcomers. From July 1, 1917, to July 27, 1919, the day
the riot began, twenty-four such bombs had been thrown. The police had
been entirely unsuccessful in finding those guilty, and were accused of making
little effort to do so.
</p>

<p>
A third phase of the situation was the increased political strength gained
by Mayor Thompson's faction in the Republican party. Negro politicians
affiliated with this faction had been able to sway to its support a large proportion
of the voters in the ward most largely inhabited by Negroes. Negro
aldermen elected from this ward were prominent in the activities of this
faction. The part played by the Negro vote in the hard-fought partisan
struggle is indicated by the fact that in the Republican primary election on
February 25, 1919, Mayor Thompson received in this ward 12,143 votes,
while his two opponents, Olson and Merriam, received only 1,492 and 319
respectively. Mayor Thompson was re-elected on April 1, 1919, by a plurality
of 21,622 in a total vote in the city of 698,920; his vote in this ward was
15,569, to his nearest opponent's 3,323, and was therefore large enough to control
the election. The bitterness of this factional struggle aroused resentment
against the race that had so conspicuously allied itself with the Thompson side.
</p>

<p>
As part of the background of the Chicago riot, the activities of gangs of
hoodlums should be cited. There had been friction for years, especially along
the western boundary of the area in which the Negroes mainly live, and
attacks upon Negroes by gangs of young toughs had been particularly frequent
in the spring just preceding the riot. They reached a climax on the night of
June 21, 1919, five weeks before the riot, when two Negroes were murdered.
Each was alone at the time and was the victim of unprovoked and particularly
brutal attack. Molestation of Negroes by hoodlums had been prevalent in
the vicinity of parks and playgrounds and at bathing-beaches.
</p>

<p>
On two occasions shortly before the riot the forewarnings of serious
racial trouble had been so pronounced that the chief of police sent several
hundred extra policemen into the territory where trouble seemed imminent.
But serious violence did not break out until Sunday afternoon, July 27, when
the clash on the lake shore at Twenty-ninth Street resulted in the drowning
of a Negro boy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>The beginning of the riot.</i>â€”Events followed so fast in the train of the drowning
that this tragedy may be considered as marking the beginning of the riot.
</p>

<p>
It was four o'clock Sunday afternoon, July 27, when Eugene Williams,
seventeen-year-old Negro boy, was swimming offshore at the foot of Twenty-ninth
Street. This beach was not one of those publicly maintained and
supervised for bathing, but it was much used. Although it flanks an area
thickly inhabited by Negroes, it was used by both races, access being had by
crossing the railway tracks which skirt the lake shore. The part near Twenty-seventh
Street had by tacit understanding come to be considered as reserved
for Negroes, while the whites used the part near Twenty-ninth Street. Walking
is not easy along the shore, and each race had kept pretty much to its
own part, observing, moreover, an imaginary boundary extending into the
water.
</p>

<p>
Williams, who had entered the water at the part used by Negroes, swam
and drifted south into the part used by the whites. Immediately before his
appearance there, white men, women, and children had been bathing in the
vicinity and were on the beach in considerable numbers. Four Negroes
walked through the group and into the water. White men summarily ordered
them off. The Negroes left, and the white people resumed their sport. But
it was not long before the Negroes were back, coming from the north with
others of their race. Then began a series of attacks and retreats, counter-attacks,
and stone-throwing. Women and children who could not escape
hid behind dÃ©bris and rocks. The stone-throwing continued, first one side
gaining the advantage, then the other.
</p>

<p>
Williams, who had remained in the water during the fracas, found a
railroad tie and clung to it, stones meanwhile frequently striking the water
near him. A white boy of about the same age swam toward him. As the white
boy neared, Williams let go of the tie, took a few strokes, and went down.
The coroner's jury rendered a verdict that he had drowned because fear of
stone-throwing kept him from shore. His body showed no stone bruises,
but rumor had it that he had actually been hit by one of the stones and
drowned as a result.
</p>

<p>
On shore guilt was immediately placed upon a certain white man by
several Negro witnesses who demanded that he be arrested by a white policeman
who was on the spot. No arrest was made.
</p>

<p>
The tragedy was sensed by the battling crowd and, awed by it, they
gathered on the beach. For an hour both whites and Negroes dived for the
boy without results. Awe gave way to excited whispers. "They" said he
was stoned to death. The report circulated through the crowd that the
police officer had refused to arrest the murderer. The Negroes in the crowd
began to mass dangerously. At this crucial point the accused policeman
arrested a Negro on a white man's complaint. Negroes mobbed the white
officer, and the riot was under way.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
</p>

<p>
One version of the quarrel which resulted in the drowning of Williams was
given by the state's attorney, who declared that it arose among white and
Negro gamblers over a craps game on the shore, "virtually under the protection
of the police officer on the beat." Eyewitnesses to the stone-throwing clash
appearing before the coroner's jury saw no gambling, but said it might have
been going on, but if so, was not visible from the water's edge. The crowd
undoubtedly included, as the grand jury declared, "hoodlums, gamblers, and
thugs," but it also included law-abiding citizens, white and Negro.
</p>

<p>
This charge, that the first riot clash started among gamblers who were
under the protection of the police officer, and also the charge that the policeman
refused to arrest the stone-thrower were vigorously denied by the police.
The policeman's star was taken from him, but after a hearing before the
Civil Service Commission it was returned, thus officially vindicating him.
</p>

<p>
The two facts, the drowning and the refusal to arrest, or widely circulated
reports of such refusal, must be considered together as marking the inception
of the riot. Testimony of a captain of police shows that first reports from the
lake after the drowning indicated that the situation was calming down. White
men had shown a not altogether hostile feeling for the Negroes by assisting
in diving for the body of the boy. Furthermore a clash started on this isolated
spot could not be augmented by outsiders rushing in. There was every possibility
that the clash, without the further stimulus of reports of the policeman's
conduct, would have quieted down.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chronological story of the riot.</i>â€”After the drowning of Williams, it was
two hours before any further fatalities occurred. Reports of the drowning
and of the alleged conduct of the policeman spread out into the neighborhood.
The Negro crowd from the beach gathered at the foot of Twenty-ninth Street.
As it became more and more excited, a group of officers was called by the
policeman who had been at the beach. James Crawford, a Negro, fired into
the group of officers and was himself shot and killed by a Negro policeman
who had been sent to help restore order.
</p>

<p>
During the remainder of the afternoon of July 27, many distorted rumors
circulated swiftly throughout the South Side. The Negro crowd from Twenty-ninth
Street got into action, and white men who came in contact with it were
beaten. In all, four white men were beaten, five were stabbed, and one was
shot. As the rumors spread, new crowds gathered, mobs sprang into activity
spontaneously, and gangs began to take part in the lawlessness.
</p>

<p>
Farther to the west, as darkness came on, white gangsters became active.
Negroes in white districts suffered severely at their hands. From 9:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
until 3:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> twenty-seven Negroes were beaten, seven were stabbed, and
four were shot.
</p>

<p>
Few clashes occurred on Monday morning. People of both races went
to work as usual and even continued to work side by side, as customary,
without signs of violence. But as the afternoon wore on, white men and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
boys living between the Stock Yards and the "Black Belt" sought malicious
amusement in directing mob violence against Negro workers returning home.
</p>

<p>
Street-car routes, especially transfer points, were thronged with white
people of all ages. Trolleys were pulled from wires and the cars brought
under the control of mob leaders. Negro passengers were dragged to the
street, beaten, and kicked. The police were apparently powerless to cope
with these numerous assaults. Four Negro men and one white assailant
were killed, and thirty Negro men were severely beaten in the street-car
clashes.
</p>

<p>
The "Black Belt" contributed its share of violence to the record of Monday
afternoon and night. Rumors of white depredations and killings were current
among the Negroes and led to acts of retaliation. An aged Italian peddler,
one Lazzeroni, was set upon by young Negro boys and stabbed to death.
Eugene Temple, white laundryman, was stabbed to death and robbed by three
Negroes.
</p>

<p>
A Negro mob made a demonstration outside Provident Hospital, an institution
conducted by Negroes, because two injured whites who had been shooting
right and left from a hurrying automobile on State Street were taken there.
Other mobs stabbed six white men, shot five others, severely beat nine more,
and killed two in addition to those named above.
</p>

<p>
Rumor had it that a white occupant of the Angelus apartment house had
shot a Negro boy from a fourth-story window. Negroes besieged the building.
The white tenants sought police protection, and about 100 policemen, including
some mounted men, responded. The mob of about 1,500 Negroes demanded
the "culprit," but the police failed to find him after a search of the building.
A flying brick hit a policeman. There was a quick massing of the police, and
a volley was fired into the Negro mob. Four Negroes were killed and many
were injured. It is believed that had the Negroes not lost faith in the white
police force it is hardly likely that the Angelus riot would have occurred.
</p>

<p>
At this point, Monday night, both whites and Negroes showed signs of
panic. Each race grouped by itself. Small mobs began systematically in
various neighborhoods to terrorize and kill. Gangs in the white districts
grew bolder, finally taking the offensive in raids through territory "invaded"
by Negro home seekers. Boys between sixteen and twenty-two banded
together to enjoy the excitement of the chase.
</p>

<p>
Automobile raids were added to the rioting Monday night. Cars from
which rifle and revolver shots were fired were driven at great speed through
sections inhabited by Negroes. Negroes defended themselves by "sniping"
and volley-firing from ambush and barricade. So great was the fear of these
raiding parties that the Negroes distrusted all motor vehicles and frequently
opened fire on them without waiting to learn the intent of the occupants.
This type of warfare was kept up spasmodically all Tuesday and was resumed
with vigor Tuesday night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At midnight, Monday, street-car clashes ended by reason of a general
strike on the surface and elevated lines. The street-railway tie-up was complete
for the remainder of the week. But on Tuesday morning this was a
new source of terror for those who tried to walk to their places of employment.
Men were killed en route to their work through hostile territory. Idle men congregated
on the streets, and gang-rioting increased. A white gang of soldiers
and sailors in uniform, augmented by civilians, raided the "Loop," or downtown
section of Chicago, early Tuesday, killing two Negroes and beating
and robbing several others. In the course of these activities they wantonly
destroyed property of white business men.
</p>

<p>
Gangs sprang up as far south as Sixty-third Street in Englewood and in
the section west of Wentworth Avenue near Forty-seventh Street. Premeditated
depredations were the order of the night. Many Negro homes in mixed
districts were attacked, and several of them were burned. Furniture was
stolen or destroyed. When raiders were driven off they would return again
and again until their designs were accomplished.
</p>

<p>
The contagion of the race war broke over the boundaries of the South
Side and spread to the Italians on the West Side. This community became
excited over a rumor, and an Italian crowd killed a Negro, Joseph Lovings.
</p>

<p>
Wednesday saw a material lessening of crime and violence. The "Black
Belt" and the district immediately west of it were still storm centers. But
the peak of the rioting had apparently passed, although the danger of fresh
outbreaks of magnitude was still imminent. Although companies of the
militia had been mobilized in nearby armories as early as Monday night,
July 28, it was not until Wednesday evening at 10:30 that the mayor yielded
to pressure and asked for their help.
</p>

<p>
Rain on Wednesday night and Thursday drove idle people of both races
into their homes. The temperature fell, and with it the white heat of the
riot. From this time on the violence was sporadic, scattered, and meager.
The riot seemed well under control, if not actually ended.
</p>

<p>
Friday witnessed only a single reported injury. At 3:35 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Saturday
incendiary fires burned forty-nine houses in the immigrant neighborhood
west of the Stock Yards. Nine hundred and forty-eight people, mostly
Lithuanians, were made homeless, and the property loss was about $250,000.
Responsibility for these fires was never fixed. The riot virtually ceased on
Saturday. For the next few days injured were reported occasionally, and by
August 8 the riot zone had settled down to normal and the militia was withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
<i>Growth of the riot.</i>â€”The riot period was thirteen days in length, from
Sunday, July 27, through Thursday, August 8, the day on which the troops
were withdrawn. Of this time, only the first seven days witnessed active
rioting. The remaining days marked the return toward normal. In the seven
active days, rioting was not continuous but intermittent, being furious for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
hours, then fairly quiescent for hours. The first three days saw the most
acute disturbance, and in this span there were three main periods: 4:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
Sunday till 3:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Monday; 9:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Monday till 9:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Tuesday;
noon Tuesday till midnight. This left two long intervals of comparative
quiet, six hours on Monday and three hours on Tuesday. On the fourth day,
Wednesday, there were scattered periods of rioting, each of a few hours'
duration. Thus Monday afternoon to Tuesday morning was the longest
stretch of active rioting in the first four days.
</p>

<p>
For the most part the riot was confined to the South Side of the city.
There were two notable exceptions, the district north and west of the south
branch of the Chicago River and the "Loop" or downtown business district.
A few isolated clashes occurred on the North Side and on the extreme West
Side, but aside from these the area covered was that shown on the accompanying
outline map.
</p>

<p>
For the purposes of discussion it is convenient to divide the riot area into
seven districts. The boundaries in some instances are due to the designation
of Wentworth Avenue by the police as a boundary west of which no Negroes
should be allowed, and east of which no whites should be allowed.
</p>

<ol class="romnum">
<li>"Black Belt." From Twenty-second to Thirty-ninth, inclusive; Wentworth
Avenue to the lake, exclusive of Wentworth; Thirty-ninth to
Fifty-fifth, inclusive; Clark to Michigan, exclusive of Michigan.
</li>
<li>Area contested by both Negroes and whites. Thirty-ninth to Fifty-fifth,
inclusive; Michigan to the lake.
</li>
<li>Southwest Side, including the Stock Yards district; south of the Chicago
River to Fifty-fifth; west of Wentworth, including Wentworth.
</li>
<li>Area south of Fifty-fifth and east of Wentworth.
</li>
<li>Area south of Fifty-fifth and west of Wentworth.
</li>
<li>Area north and west of the Chicago River.
</li>
<li>"Loop" or business district and vicinity.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In the district designated as the "Black Belt" about 90 per cent of the
Negroes live. District II, the "contested area," is that in which most of the
bombings have occurred. Negroes are said to be "invading" this district.
Extension here instead of into District III, toward the Stock Yards neighborhood,
may be explained partly by the hostility which the Irish and Polish
groups to the west had often shown to Negroes. The white hoodlum element
of the Stock Yards district, designated as III, was characterized by the state's
attorney of Cook County, when he remarked that more bank robbers, pay-roll
bandits, automobile bandits, highwaymen, and strong-arm crooks come from
this particular district than from any other that has come to his notice during
seven years of service as chief prosecuting official.<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
</p>

<p>
In District IV and V, south of Fifty-fifth Street, Negroes live in small
communities surrounded by white people or are scattered through white
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
neighborhoods. District VI has a large Italian population. District VII is
Chicago's wholesale and retail center.
</p>

<p class="caption">THE CHICAGO RIOT<br />
JULY, 27 TO AUGUST, 8, 1919</p>

</div>

<p>
On only one day of the riot were all these districts involved in the race
warfare. This was Tuesday. On Sunday Districts I, III, and IV suffered
clashes; on Monday all but District VI were involved; on Tuesday the entire
area was affected; on Wednesday District VII was not included, and District
VI witnessed only one clash; on Thursday District IV was again normal, and
Districts II, V, and VII were comparatively quiet; during the remainder of
the week only the first three districts named were active.
</p>

<p>
The worst clashes were in Districts I and III, and of those reported injured,
34 per cent received their wounds in the "Black Belt," District I, and 41
per cent on the Southwest Side, in the district including the Stock Yards,
District III.
</p>

<p>
Factors contributing to the subsidence of the riot were the natural
reaction from the tension, efforts of police and citizens to curb the rioters, the
entrance of the militia on Wednesday, and last, but perhaps not least, a heavy
rain.
</p>

<p>
The longest period of violence without noticeable lull was 9:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Monday
to 9:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Tuesday. On Tuesday the feeling was most intense, as shown
by the nature of the clashes. Arson was prevalent on Tuesday for the first
time, and the property loss was considerable. But judging by the only definite
index, the number of dead and injured, Monday exceeded Tuesday in violence,
showing 229 injured and eighteen dead as against 139 injured and eleven
dead on the latter day. While it is apparent that no single hour or even day
can be called the peak of the riot, the height of violence clearly falls within
the two-day period Monday, July 28, and Tuesday, July 29.
</p>

<p>
The change in the nature of the clashes day by day showed an increase
in intensity of feeling and greater boldness in action. This development
reached its peak on Tuesday. Later came a decline, sporadic outbursts
succeeding sustained activity.
</p>

<p>
<i>Factors influencing growth of the riot.</i>â€”After the attacks had stopped,
about 3:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Monday, they did not again assume serious proportions until
Monday afternoon, when workers began to return to their homes, and idle
men gathered in the streets in greater numbers than during working hours.
The Stock Yards laborers are dismissed for the day in shifts. Negroes coming
from the Yards at the 3:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, 4:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and later shifts were met by white
gangs armed with bats and clubs. On Tuesday morning men going to work,
both Negro and white, were attacked.
</p>

<p>
The main areas of violence were thoroughfares and natural highways
between the job and the home. On the South Side 76 per cent of all the
injuries occurred on such streets. The most turbulent corners were those on
State Street between Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth, on Cottage Grove Avenue
at Sixty-third Street, on Halsted Street at Thirty-fifth and Forty-seventh
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
streets and on Archer Avenue at Thirty-fifth Street. Injuries at these spots
were distributed as follows:<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>

<p>
The street-car situation had an effect upon the riot both before the strike
and after it. Because of a shortage of labor at the time, the surface-street-car
company had put on a number of inexperienced men. This may account
for the inefficiency of some crews in handling attacked cars.
</p>

<p>
An example is the case of Henry Goodman who was killed in an attack on
a Thirty-ninth Street car. The car was stopped at Union Avenue by a truck
suspiciously stalled across the tracks. White men boarded the car and beat
and chased six or eight Negro passengers. When asked under oath to whom
the truck directly in front of him belonged and what color it was, the motorman
replied, "I couldn't say." When asked what time his car left the end of the
line and whether or not he had seen any Negroes hit on the car, he answered,
"I didn't pay any attention." The motorman said he made a report of the
case, but it could not be found by anyone in the street-car company's office.
The conductor of this car had been given orders to warn Negroes that there
was rioting in the district through which the car ran. He did not do this.
He ignored the truck. No names of witnesses were secured. The motorman
was an extra man and had run on that route only during the day of the attack.
</p>

<p>
In the case of John Mills, a Negro who was killed as he fled from a Forty-seventh
Street car, the motorman left the car while Negroes were being beaten
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
inside it. Neither motorman nor conductor took names of witnesses or
attempted to fix a description of the assailants in mind.
</p>

<p>
When B. F. Hardy, a Negro, was killed on a street car at Forty-sixth
Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, the motorman and conductor offered no
resistance and did not get names or descriptions.
</p>

<p>
The testimony of the conductor and motorman on a car attacked at
Thirty-eighth Street and Ashland Avenue was clear and showed an attempt to
get all information possible. They secured names of witnesses. One member
of the crew had been in the service of the Chicago Surface Lines for ten years,
and the other for twelve years.
</p>

<p>
The tie-up of the street railways affected the riot situation by forcing
laborers to walk, making them more liable to assault in the hostile districts,
by keeping many workers from jobs, turning out on the streets hundreds of
idle men, and by increasing the use of automobiles.
</p>

<p>
Tuesday morning two white men were killed while walking to work through
the Negro area, and two Negroes were killed while going through the white area.
</p>

<p>
Curiosity led the idle to the riot zone. One such was asked on the witness
stand why he went. "What was I there for? Because I walked thereâ€”my
own bad luck. I was curious to see how they did it, that is all."
</p>

<p>
Under cover of legitimate use gangs used motor vehicles for raiding.
Witnesses of rioting near Ogden Park said trucks unloaded passengers on
Racine Avenue, facilitating the formation of a mob. On Halsted Street
crowds of young men rode in trucks shouting they were out to "get the niggers."
An automobile load of young men headed off Heywood Thomas, Negro, and
shot him, at Taylor and Halsted streets, as he was walking home from work.
</p>

<p>
Beside daily routine and the street-car situation, the weather undoubtedly
had an influence in the progress of the riot. July 27 was hot, 96 degrees, or
fourteen points above normal. It was the culmination of a series of days
with high temperatures around 95 degrees, which meant that nerves were
strained. The warm weather of Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday also kept
crowds on the streets and sitting on doorsteps until late at night. Innocent
people trying to keep cool were injured when automobiles raced through the
streets, the occupants firing to right and left. Wednesday night and Thursday
it rained. Cool weather followed for the rest of the week.
</p>

<p>
<i><a name="Gangs" id="Gangs">Gangs and "athletic clubs."</a></i>â€”Gangs and their activities were an important
factor throughout the riot. But for them it is doubtful if the riot would have
gone beyond the first clash. Both organized gangs and those which sprang
into existence because of the opportunity afforded seized upon the excuse
of the first conflict to engage in lawless acts.
</p>

<p>
It was no new thing for youthful white and Negro groups to come to
violence. For years, as the sections of this report dealing with antecedent
clashes and with recreation show, there had been clashes over baseball grounds,
swimming-pools in the parks, the right to walk on certain streets, etc.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Gangs whose activities figured so prominently in the riot were all white
gangs, or "athletic clubs." Negro hoodlums do not appear to form organized
gangs so readily. Judges of the municipal court said that there are no gang
organizations among Negroes to compare with those found among young whites.
</p>

<p>
The Stock Yards district, just west of the main Negro area, is the home
of many of these white gangs and clubs; it is designated as District III in the
discussion of the riot growth. The state's attorney, as already indicated
(see <a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>), referred to the many young offenders who come from this particular
district. A police detective sergeant who investigated the riot cases in this
district said of this section, "It is a pretty tough neighborhood to try to get
any information out there; you can't do it." A policeman on the beat in
the district said, "There is the Canaryville bunch in there and the Hamburg
bunch. It is a pretty tough hole in there."
</p>

<p>
There was much evidence and talk of the political "pull" and even leadership
of these gangs with reference to their activities in the riot. A member
of "Ragen's Colts" just after the riot passed the word that the "coppers"
from downtown were looking for club members, but that "there need be no
fear of the coppers from the station at the Yards for they were all fixed and told
to lay off on club members." During the riot he claimed they were well
protected by always having a "cop" ride in one of the automobiles so everything
would be "O.K." in case members of the gang were picked up. Another
member of the club said he had been "tipped off by the police at the Yards
to clean out and keep away from the usual hangouts because investigators
were working out of Hoyne's and out of Brundage's offices, and were checking
up on the activities of the 'Ragen's' during the riot."
</p>

<p>
The foreman of the August grand jury which investigated the riot cases
said in testifying before the Commission:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The lead we got to investigate the Forty-seventh Street district was from an
anonymous letter stating that Ragen had such influence in the Forty-seventh Street
police station that these individuals were allowed to go without due process of law.
</p>

<p>
I didn't believe that was a fact in this particular instance. We did learn that
Ragen was a great power in that district and at the time of our investigation we
learned that some of the "Ragen's Colts" had broken into the police station and
pried open a door of a closet where they had a good deal of evidence in the nature of
weapons of prisoners concealed, and they got all of this evidence out of there without
the police knowing anything about it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The station referred to is at Forty-seventh and Halsted streets. Gangs
operated for hours up and down Forty-seventh Street, Wells, Princeton, Shields,
and Wentworth avenues and Federal Street without hindrance from the police.

<p>
A judge of the municipal court said in testimony before the Commission:
"They seemed to think they had a sort of protection which entitled them to
go out and assault anybody. When the race riots occurred it gave them
something to satiate the desire to inflict their evil propensities on others."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Besides shouting as they rode down the streets in trucks that they were
out to "get the niggers," they defied the law in other ways. When the militia
men came on the scene on the fourth day of the riot, they testified to trouble
with these gangsters. One of the colonels testified before the Commission:
"They didn't like to be controlled. They would load up heavy trucks with
rowdies and try to force through the lines. They'd come tooting their horns
and having back pressure explosions like gatling guns."
</p>

<p>
Some of the "athletic club" gangsters had criminal records. L&#8239;â€”â€”&nbsp;W&#8239;â€”â€”
was accused of being one of the leaders of the gang around Forty-seventh and
Wells streets. He himself said boastfully, "I have been arrested about
fifteen times for 'disorderly' and never was arrested with a knife or a gun."
Several witnesses said they had seen him during the riot one night leading
the mob and brandishing a razor and the next night waving a gun. He was
not arrested. D&#8239;â€”â€”&nbsp;H&#8239;â€”â€”, seventeen years old, was identified as being active
in the rioting near Forty-seventh Street and Forrestville Avenue. His defense
was that he was not closer to the Negro assaulted than across the street, but
because he was arrested the year before for a "stick-up" people looked "funny"
at him when anything happened. R&#8239;â€”â€”&nbsp;C&#8239;â€”â€” was accused of having been
implicated in the arson cases on Shields Avenue. When his mother was
interviewed, she said she knew nothing of the rioting, but said her son was at
the time in the county jail, "but not for that." W&#8239;â€”â€”&nbsp;G&#8239;â€”â€” was identified
many times as having taken part in the arson on Wentworth Avenue. He was
indicted for both arson and conspiracy to riot. Two years before the riot he
had been arrested for larceny.
</p>

<p>
All who discussed gangs before the Commission said that most of the
members were boys of seventeen to twenty-two years of age. Witnesses
before the coroner's juries testified to the youth of the participants in mobs.
Many of the active assailants of street cars were boys. In the case of the Negro
Hardy who was killed on a street car, it was said that the murderers were
not over twenty years, and many were nearer sixteen. In the raids in the
Ogden Park district the participants were between the ages of fifteen and
twenty. The raid just west of Wentworth Avenue, where a number of houses
were much damaged, was perpetrated by boys of these ages. The attacking
mob on Forty-third Street near Forrestville Avenue, was led by boys of eighteen
to twenty-one. The only two hoodlums caught participating in the outrages
in the "Loop," the downtown business district, were seventeen and about
twenty-one. Most of those arrested on suspicion in the arson cases were
taken before the boys' court. Negroes involved in many cases as assailants
were also youthful. The young Negro boys who killed Lazzeroni were fourteen
to eighteen; those who killed Pareko and Perel were about sixteen.
</p>

<p>
A member of "Ragen's Colts" is said to have boasted that their territory extended
from Cottage Grove Avenue to Ashland Avenue and from Forty-third
Street to Sixty-third Street. At Sixty-third Street and Cottage Grove Avenue
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
they were said to have attacked a colored man in a restaurant and thrown him
out of the window. It was reported that trucks of a downtown store, each
carrying about thirty men, yelling that they were "Ragen's Colts" and that
"Ragen's bunch" were going to clean out the community, came to Sixtieth
Street and Racine Avenue. Some of the boys who took part in the assault
upon Negroes at Sixtieth and Ada streets were reputed to be members of
"Ragen's Colts." The club, according to some of its own members, operated
with automobiles from which they managed to "bump off a number of Niggers."
A truck driver said he had driven some "Ragen's Colts" to Forty-seventh
and Halsted streets, where they "dropped" four or five people, then he drove
them back to the "Ragen's Colts" clubhouse at Fifty-second and Halsted
streets. "And," he says, "they had plenty of guns and ammunition." State's
Attorney Hoyne, however, said that no evidence could be found that "Ragen's
Colts" had a store of arms. Members of the Illinois Reserve Militia reported
that they had been threatened by "Ragen's Colts" that they would be picked
off one by one when they got off duty.
</p>

<p>
One of the most serious cases of rioting in which members of "Ragen's
Colts" were reported to be implicated was the raid upon Shields Avenue,
where there were nine houses occupied by Negroes. At 8:30 Tuesday evening
200 or 300 gangsters started at one corner and worked through the block,
throwing furniture out of windows and setting fires. A white man who owned
a house on this street which he rented to Negroes says that after the raid
several young men warned him, "If you open your mouth against 'Ragen's'
we will not only burn your house down but we will 'do' you."
</p>

<p>
The Lorraine Club, according to five witnesses, was also implicated in
arson and raids upon homes of Negroes. Their operations, according to reports,
were on Forty-seventh Street and on Wells Street and Wentworth Avenue
between Forty-seventh and Forty-eighth streets. Negroes were chased,
guns were fired, windows broken, front doors smashed in, furniture destroyed,
and finally homes were burned. All Negro families were driven out. The
attack was planned, and news of its imminence spread abroad in the morning.
Rioting started in the afternoon of July 29, and culminated late that night.
There was no interference from the police at any time. It was said that one
of the leaders of the gang who had an express and coal yard carried away
furniture in his wagon. Another was recognized as a youth who had shot a
Negro woman during the afternoon. They are reported to have attacked an
undertaker and friends who came to remove the body of a dead Negro. Three
of the rioters were arrested upon the identification of several people, but two
were released in the municipal court, and the third had a "no bill" returned
before the grand jury. One was released because no witnesses were present
to prosecute him. The witnesses said they were not notified.

A member of the Lorraine Club denied that his club had anything to
do with this riot, but said it was Our Flag Club that did the "dirty work."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
Our Flag Club is located farther east on Forty-seventh Street near Union
Avenue. When John Mills was dragged from a street car at this point and
killed, a policeman recognized several of the club's members in the crowd,
but vouchsafed the opinion that they were not part of the aggressive mob,
"for they did not run as did the others when the patrol came down the street."
Another policeman said he had never had any trouble with the club.
</p>

<p>
Eight members of the Sparklers' Club were seen at the fire at 5919 Wentworth
Avenue, a building in which two Negro families lived. The arson is
reported to have been planned in a neighboring cigar store. One of the boys
put waste soaked in gasoline under the porch and ran. Two of them threw
oil in the building and two others lit it. It took three attempts to make a
fire at this place. Each time it was started the Fire Department put it out.
Two of the boys are declared to have stolen phonograph records and silverware
from the house. A lad not a member of the club was with them at the fire.
Afterward one of the boys warned him, "Watch your dice and be careful or
you won't see your home any more." Six boys were held for arson, in connection
with this affair; one was discharged in the boys' court, and the cases of
two others were nolle prossed. In connection with their arrest the <i>Chicago
Tribune</i> of August 15, 1919, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Evidence that organized bands of white youths have been making a business of
burning Negro dwellings was said to have been handed to Attorney General Brundage
and Assistant State's Attorney Irwin Walker.... Chief of Police Garrity, also
informed of the Fire Marshal's charges, declared several so-called athletic clubs in
the Stock Yards district may lose their charters as a result.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A report about the Aylward Club was to the effect that as the Negroes
came from the Stock Yards on Monday, a gang of its members armed with
clubs was waiting for them and that each singled out a Negro and beat him,
the police looking on.
</p>

<p>
The names of a number of gang ringleaders were reported by investigators.
For illustration, L. Dennis, a Negro of 6059 Throop Street, was attacked
on the night of Monday, July 28, by a mob led by three roughs whose names
were learned and whose loafing place was at Sixty-third Street and Racine
Avenue. A mob of thirty white men who shot Francis Green, Negro, eighteen
years old, at Garfield Boulevard and State Street had a club headquarters in
the vicinity of Fifty-fourth Street and their "hangout" was at the corner of
Garfield Boulevard and State Street.
</p>

<p>
Other clubs mentioned in riot testimony before the coroner's jury, but
not in connection with riot clashes, are the Pine Club, the Hamburgers, the
Emeralds, the White Club, Favis Grey's, and the Mayflower. The police
closed the clubs for a period of several months after the riot. There were then
in existence a number of Negro gambling clubs, and the state's attorney
declared that it was the colored gamblers who "started this shooting and
tearing around town," and that "as soon as they heard the news that the boy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
Williams was drowned, they filled three or four machines and started out to
shoot."
</p>

<p>
A saloon-keeper near Wabash Avenue and Fifty-fifth Street, one of the
leaders of these colored gamblers, was identified by a white woman as being
in an automobile with five other Negroes exhorting colored men to riot after
the drowning of Williams. The next day he was arrested in an automobile
with other colored men who were said to be shooting into the homes of white
people. They were arrested but were discharged by Judge Barasa at the
Stock Yards court.
</p>

<p>
Police raids were made on some of the "Black Belt" clubs on August 23.
At the Ranier Club, 3010 South State Street, two revolvers, one razor,
one "black-jack," seven cartridges, one cattle knife, and one ordinary knife
were found. At the Pioneer Club, 3512 South State Street, eight guns, four
packages of cartridges and twenty-four knives were taken. A raid at 2700
South State Street netted four guns, one hunting-knife, and fifty-eight cartridges
and bullets.
</p>

<p>
The foreman of the grand jury which investigated the riots discussing the
"athletic" and "social" clubs before the Commission, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Most of them were closed immediately after the riots. There were "Ragen's
Colts," as they were known, concerning whom the grand jury were particularly anxious
to get something concrete, although no evidence was presented that convicted any
of the members of that club. There were the Hamburgers, another athletic club,
the Lotus Club, the Mayflower, and various clubs. These were white clubs.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Asked if they really were athletic clubs, he replied:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think they are athletic only with their fists and brass knuckles and guns. We
had Mr. Ragen before the grand jury, and he told us of the noble work that they
were doing in the district, that Father Brian, who had charge of these boys, taught
them to box and how to build themselves up physically, and they were doing a most
noble work, and you would think that Ragen was a public benefactor. During the
deliberations of this grand jury a number of anonymous letters were written with
reference to "Ragen's Colts," and most of the explanations of the fact that they
failed to put their names on these letters were that they were afraid they would lose
their lives.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The grand jury included in its report this reference to the gang and club
phase of the riot:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The authorities employed to enforce the law should thoroughly investigate clubs
and other organizations posing as athletic and social clubs which really are organizations
of hoodlums and criminals formed for the purpose of furthering the interest of
local politics. In the opinion of this jury many of the crimes committed in the
"Black Belt" by whites and the fires that were started back of the Yards, which,
however, were credited to the Negroes, were more than likely the work of the gangs
operating on the Southwest Side under the guise of these clubs, and the jury believes
that these fires were started for the purpose of inciting race feeling by blaming same
on the blacks. These gangs have apparently taken an active part in the race riots,
and no arrests of their members have been made as far as this jury is aware.

<p>
The coroner's jury which conducted inquests into the thirty-eight riot
deaths said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The suggestion has also been made that race hatred and tendency to race rioting
had its birth and was fostered in the numerous social and athletic clubs made up of
young men and scattered throughout the city. We doubt this, but if in part true, it
calls for the inspection and control of such clubs. These clubs are here, they are
popular, they take the place of the disappearing saloon and poolroom. Properly
governed and controlled, they should be encouraged and fostered and, when necessary,
disciplined.
</p>

<p>
Hoodlums are the nucleus of a mobâ€”the young, idle, vicious, and in many
instances degenerate and criminal, impatient of restraint of law, gather together, and
when fortified by sufficient numbers, start out on a mission of disorder, law-breaking,
destruction, and murder. Mobs, white or colored, grow about a nucleus of this
character.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i><a name="Clashes" id="Clashes">Types of clashes.</a></i>â€”Racial outbreaks are often characterized by hangings,
burnings, and mutilations, and frequently the cause given for them is a reported
Negro attack upon a white woman. None of these features appeared in the
Chicago riot. An attempted hanging was reported by a white detective
but was unsubstantiated. A report that Joseph Lovings, one of the Negroes
killed in the riot, was burned, was heralded abroad and even carried to the
United States Senate, but it was false. The coroner's physicians found no
burns on his body.
</p>

<p>
Reports of assaults upon women were at no time mentioned or even hinted
at as a cause of the Chicago riot, but after the disorder started reports of such
crimes were published in the white and Negro press, but they had no foundation
in fact.
</p>

<p>
Of the ten women wounded in the Chicago riot, seven were white, two were
Negroes, and the race of one is unknown. All but one of these ten injuries
appears to have been accidental. The exception was the case of Roxy Pratt,
a Negro woman who, with her brother, was chased down Wells Street from
Forty-seventh by gangsters and was seriously wounded by a bullet. No cases
of direct attacks upon white women by Negro men were reported.
</p>

<p>
The Commission has the record of numerous instances, principally during
the first twenty-four hours, where individuals of opposing races met, knives
or guns were drawn, and injury was inflicted without the element of mob
stimulus.
</p>

<p>
On Monday mobs operated in sudden, excited assaults, and attacks on
street cars provided outstanding cases, five persons being killed and many
injured. Nicholas Kleinmark, a white assailant, was stabbed to death by a
Negro named Scott, acting in self-defense. Negroes killed were Henry Goodman
at Thirtieth and Union streets; John Mills, on Forty-seventh Street
near Union; Louis Taylor at Root Street and Wentworth Avenue; and B. F.
Hardy at Forty-sixth Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. All died from
beatings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Crowds armed themselves with stones, bricks, and baseball bats and
scanned passing street cars for Negroes. Finding them, trolleys were pulled
off wires and entrance to the cars forced. Negroes were dragged from under
car seats and beaten. Once off the car the chase began. If possible, the
vanguard of the mob caught the fleeing Negroes and beat them with clubs. If
the Negro outran the pursuers, stones and bricks brought him down. Sometimes
the chase led through back yards and over fences, but it was always short.
</p>

<p>
Another type of race warfare was the automobile raids carried on by young
men crowded in cars, speeding across the dead line at Wentworth Avenue
and the "Black Belt," and firing at random. Crowded colored districts,
with people sitting on front steps and in open windows, were subjected to this
menace. Strangely enough, only one person was killed in these raids, Henry
Baker, Negro.
</p>

<p>
Automobile raids were reported wherever colored people had established
themselves, in the "Black Belt," both on the main business streets and in
the residence sections, and in the small community near Ada and Loomis
streets in the vicinity of Ogden Park.
</p>

<p>
These raids began Monday night, continued spasmodically all day Tuesday,
and were again prevalent that night. In spite of the long period, reports of
motorcycle policemen show no white raiders arrested. One suspected raiding
automobile was caught on State Street Tuesday night, after collision with a
patrol wagon. One of the occupants, a white man, had on his person the
badge and identification card of a policeman assigned to the Twenty-fourth
Precinct. No case was worked up against him, and the other men in the
machine were not heard of again in connection with the raid.
</p>

<p>
Most of the police motorcycle squad was assigned to the Stanton Avenue
station, which was used as police headquarters in the "Black Belt." Several
automobile loads of Negroes were arrested, and firearms were found either
upon their persons or in the automobile.
</p>

<p>
In only two cases were Negroes aggressively rioting found outside of the
"Black Belt." One of these was the case of the saloon-keeper already mentioned,
and the other was that of a deputy sheriff, who, with a party of other
men, said they were on the way to the Stock Yards to rescue some beleaguered
members of their race. It is reported that they wounded five white people
en route. Sheriff Peters said he understood that the deputy sheriff was
attacked by white mobs and fired to clear the crowd. He was not convicted.
</p>

<p>
"Sniping" was a form of retaliation by Negroes which grew out of the
automobile raids. These raiding automobiles were fired upon from yards,
porches, and windows throughout the "Black Belt." One of the most serious
cases reported was at Thirty-first and State streets, where Negroes barricaded
the streets with rubbish boxes. Motorcycle Policeman Cheney rammed
through and was hit by a bullet. His companion officer following was knocked
from his machine and the machine punctured with bullets.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After the wounding of Policeman Cheney and Sergeant Murray, of the
Sixth Precinct, policemen made a thorough search of all Negro homes near
the scene of the "sniping." Thirty-four Negroes were arrested. Of these,
ten were discharged, ten were found not guilty, one was given one day in jail,
one was given five days in jail, one was fined and put on probation, two were
fined $10 and costs, one was fined $25; six were given thirty days each in the
House of Correction, and one, who admitted firing twice but said he was firing
at one of the automobiles, was sentenced to six months in the House of Correction.
His case was taken to the appellate court.
</p>

<p>
Concerted retaliatory race action showed itself in the Italian district
around Taylor and Loomis streets when rumor said that a little Italian girl
had been killed or wounded by a shot fired by a Negro. Joseph Lovings, an
innocent Negro, came upon the excited crowd of Italians. There was a short
chase through back yards. Finally Lovings was dragged from his hiding-place
in a basement and brutally murdered by the crowd. The coroner
reported fourteen bullet wounds on his body, eight still having bullets in them;
also various stab wounds, contusions of the head, and fractures of the skull.
Rumor made the tale more hideous, saying that Lovings was burned after
gasoline had been poured over the dead body. This was not true.
</p>

<p>
This same massing of race against race was shown in a similar clash between
Italians and Negroes on the North Side. The results here, however, were not
serious. It was reported in this last case that immediately after the fracas
the Negroes and Italians were again on good terms. This was not true in
the neighborhood of the Lovings outrage. Miss Jane Addams, of Hull-House,
which is near the scene of Lovings' death, testified before the Commission
that before the riot the Italians held no particular animosity toward Negroes,
for those in the neighborhood were mostly from South Italy and accustomed
to the dark-skinned races, but that they were developing antipathy. In the
September following the riot, she said the neighborhood was still full of wild
stories so stereotyped in character that they appeared to indicate propaganda
spread for a purpose.
</p>

<p>
The gang which operated in the "Loop" was composed partly of soldiers
and sailors in uniform; they were boys of from seventeen to twenty-two,
out for a "rough" time and using race prejudice as a shield for robbery. At
times this crowd numbered 100. Its depredations began shortly after 2:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
Tuesday. The La Salle Street railroad station was entered twice, and Negro
men were beaten and robbed. About 3:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> activities were transferred
to Wabash Avenue. In the hunt for Negroes one restaurant was wrecked
and the vandalism was continued in another restaurant where two Negroes
were found. One was severely injured and the other was shot down. The
gangsters rolled the body into the gutter and turned the pockets inside out; they
stood on the corner of Wabash Avenue and Adams Street and divided the spoils,
openly boasting later of having secured $52, a diamond ring, a watch, and a brooch.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Attacks in the "Loop" continued as late as ten o'clock Tuesday morning,
Negroes being chased through the streets and beaten. Warned by the Pinkerton
Detective Agency, business men with stores on Wabash Avenue came to
protect their property. The rioting was reported to the police by the restaurant
men. Policemen rescued two Negroes that morning, but so many policemen
had been concentrated in and near the "Black Belt" that there were only
a few patrolmen in the whole "Loop" district, and these did not actively
endeavor to cope with the mob. In the meantime two Negroes were killed
and others injured, while property was seriously damaged.
</p>

<p>
Tuesday's raids marked the peak of daring during the riot, and their
subsidence was as gradual as their rise. For the next two days the gangs
roamed the streets, intermittently attacking Negro homes. After Tuesday
midnight their operations were not so open or so concerted. The riot gradually
decreased in feeling and scope till the last event of a serious nature occurred,
the incendiary fires back of the Stock Yards.
</p>

<p>
While there is general agreement that these fires were incendiary, no clue
could be found to the perpetrators. Negroes were suspected, as all the houses
burned belonged to whites. In spite of this fact, and the testimony of thirteen
people who said they saw Negroes in the vicinity before or during the fires,
a rumor persisted that the fires were set by white people with blackened faces.
One of the men living in the burned district who testified to seeing a motor
truck filled with Negroes said, when asked about the color of the men, "Sure,
I know they were colored. Of course I don't know whether they were
painted." An early milk-wagon driver said that he saw Negroes come out
of a barn on Forty-third Street and Hermitage Avenue. Immediately afterward
the barn burst into flames. He ran to a policeman and reported it.
The policeman said he was "too busy" and "it is all right anyway." One of
the colonels commanding a regiment of militia said he thought white people
with blackened faces had set fire to the houses; he got this opinion from talking
to the police in charge of that district.
</p>

<p>
Miss Mary McDowell, of the University of Chicago Settlement, which is
located back of the Yards, said in testimony before the Commission:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I don't think the Negroes did burn the houses. I think the white hoodlums
burned them. The Negroes weren't back there, they stayed at home after that
Monday. When we got hold of the firemen confidentially, they said no Negroes
set fire to them at all, but the newspapers said so and the people were full of fear.
All kinds of mythical stories were afloat for some time.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The general superintendent of Armour &amp; Company was asked, when testifying
before the Commission, if he knew of any substantial reason why
Negroes were accused of setting fires back of the Yards. He answered:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
That statement was originated in the minds of a few individuals, radicals. It
does not exist in the minds of the conservative and thinking people of the community,
even those living in back of the Yards. They know better. I believe it goes without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
saying that there isn't a colored man, regardless of how little brains he'd have, who
would attempt to go over into the Polish district and set fire to anybody's house
over there. He wouldn't get that far.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The controlling superintendent of Swift &amp; Company said he could not say it
from his own experience, but he understood there was as much friction between
the Poles and Lithuanians who worked together in the Yards as between the
Negroes and the whites. The homes burned belonged to Lithuanians. The
grand jury stated in its report: "The jury believes that these fires were started
for the purpose of inciting race feeling by blaming same on the blacks."
</p>

<p>
The methods of attack used by Negroes and whites during the riot differed;
the Negroes usually clung to individual attack and the whites to mob action.
Negroes used chiefly firearms and knives, and the whites used their fists,
bricks, stones, baseball bats, pieces of iron, hammers. Among the white men,
69 per cent were shot or stabbed and 31 per cent were beaten; among the
Negroes almost the reverse was true, 35 per cent being shot and stabbed and
65 per cent beaten. A colonel in charge of a regiment of militia on riot duty
says they found few whites but many Negroes armed.
</p>

<p>
<i>Arms and ammunition.</i>â€”The foregoing figures and statements gave some
color to the belief persistent during and after the riot that Negroes had stores
of arms and ammunition. A lieutenant of police testified before the coroner's
jury that he had known in advance that the riot was coming because "there
were guns in every house out there; I knew they were there for a purpose."
He said he had heard that Negroes had been advised to arm themselves and
defend their homes, that the Constitution of the United States provided for
that. The state's attorney said before the Commission that prior to the
riot he had received reports from detectives of private agencies stating the same
thing. He was informed that Negroes readily got firearms from Gary, Indiana,
and that porters on the Pullman trains brought them in from outside places.
He further stated: "I am very definitely assured of the fact that they were
arming and that there were more arms and weapons grouped in that general
district loosely termed the 'Black Belt' than any place else, and my information
is that conditions are that way now."
</p>

<p>
During the riot there were frequent rumors that Negroes had broken into
the Eighth Regiment Armory for guns and ammunition, but all these rumors
were proved false.
</p>

<p>
Since the riot many tales have been told of stores of arms brought in by
Pullman porters and by white prostitutes. Mexicans were reported to be
assisting Negroes in the manufacture of bombs and hand grenades. Lists of
addresses where ammunition was being stored have been gathered by detectives,
but not verified.
</p>

<p>
The same sort of rumors are found circulating among the Negroes in regard
to the arming of whites. It is said that such and such white men have great
boxes of guns and ammunition in the cellars of their homes, and that white
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
men are forming shooting clubs for the purpose of attacking Negroes in the
event of another riot. There are also widely believed stories that a department
store sold guns to white people before the riot but refused to sell to Negroes. It
was said that pawn shops sold to white people without permits from the police.
</p>

<p>
<i>Crowds and mobs.</i>â€”It may be observed that a crowd is merely a gathering
of people while a mob is a crowd with its attention so strongly fixed upon some
lawless purpose that other purposes are inhibited and it acts along the line
of the one purpose. During the riot many crowds of curiosity seekers were
transformed into vicious mobs when exciting rumors circulated and the suggestion
of vengeance was made by leaders. Such suggestion was frequently
accompanied by some daring act, stimulated by the excitement.
</p>

<p>
The mob in its entirety usually did not participate actively. It was one
in spirit, but divided in performance into a small active nucleus and a large
proportion of spectators. The nucleus was composed of young men from
sixteen to twenty-one or twenty-two years of age. Sometimes only four would
be active while fifty or 150 looked on, but at times the proportion would be as
great as twenty-five in 200 or fifty in 300. Fifty is the largest number reported
for a mob nucleus. This was in the case of John Mills and five other Negroes
who were beaten, dragged off a Forty-seventh Street car and chased, Mills
being killed. Here there were three degrees of crowd formation. First came
the nucleus of fifty active men who did the beating, chasing, and killing.
Closely aiding and abetting them were 300 or 400 others. After the Negroes
had been forced off the car and were being hunted through the neighborhood
a crowd of about 2,000 gathered and followed the vanguard of attackers
and spectators. These were present out of morbid curiosity, but sufficiently
imbued with the spirit of the mob not to interfere with the outrages.
</p>

<p>
The fact that children were frequently a part of mobs is one of the thought-provoking
facts of the Chicago riot. Psychologists say that impressions made
upon the child mind are forces which mold adult character to a great extent.
A number of children, some not more than four or five years old, swarmed
in front of the Forty-seventh Street car in the John Mills case and effectively
blocked it while men climbed aboard and sought out the Negroes. Children,
often witnesses of mob brutality, ran to where Negro victims had fallen and
pointed them out to the policemen who came up after the mobs had dispersed.
</p>

<p>
There were others, still children in mind, Negro boys of fifteen, accused
of murders. The enormity of their acts faded in the joy of describing their
weapons. "Fat had a club; it looked like a police club," said one, "it had
leather on it." "And the gun had a little picture of an owl on the side of it,"
said another describing a patched-up weapon that brought down a white
laboring-man who left a widow and eight children.

<p>
Among the spectators of mob violence were men, women, and children
of all ages; they included tradesmen, craftsmen, salesmen, laborers. Though
the spectators did not commit the crimes, they must share the moral responsibility.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
Without the spectators mob violence would probably have stopped
short of murder in many cases. An example of the behavior of the active
nucleus when out of sight of the spectators bears this out. George Carr,
Negro, was chased from a street car. He outstripped all but the vanguard
of the mob by climbing fences and hiding in a back yard. This concealed
him from the rest of the crowd, who by that time were chasing other Negroes.
The young men who followed Carr left him without striking a blow, upon his
mere request for clemency. In regard to the large non-active elements in
the crowds, the coroner said during the inquest, "It is just the swelling of
crowds of that kind that urges them on, because they naturally feel that they
are backed up by the balance of the crowd, which may not be true, but they
feel that way." Juror Ware said, "If sightseers were lending their aid and
assistanceâ€”" Juror Dillon interrupted and finished, "they ought to be
punished."
</p>

<p>
Often the "sightseers" and even those included in the nucleus did not know
why they had taken part in crimes the viciousness of which was not apparent
to them until afterward. A mere attempt to cover up participation would
have called forth excuses in testimony, but their answers show irritation at
the questioning, an inability to appreciate the situation, or complete bewilderment.
These excerpts from the testimony before the coroner's jury are
examples:
</p>

<p>
Henry Woodman, in the mob at Sixtieth and Ada streets: "I don't know.
I didn't have any grudge against them [the Negroes]. But they [the mob]
seemed to have it in for the colored people. That is all."
</p>

<p>
Edward Klose, in the mob in front of 1021 South State Street: "I followed
the crowd, and I was in there because I was in there; they all bunched around
and what could I do?"
</p>

<p>
One of the boys in the mob at Forty-third Street and Forrestville Avenue:
"I just wanted to see how things were getting along. We wanted to see
what the riot looked like."
</p>

<p>
Another of this same crowd: "I was following the rest. I wanted to see
what they were going to do."
</p>

<p>
Another from the same mob: "When they started to grab them [the
Negroes] in the lot, I rushed over directly to the conflict, by the colored men,
thinking I would see more on that side."
</p>

<p>
Mobs got under way for the commission of atrocities by having the direct
suggestion put to them by one of the leaders. With minds already prepared
by rumors circulating wherever crowds gathered, it was easy to arouse action.
A street car approaching and the cry, "Get the niggers!" was enough.
Prompt action clinched the idea, and the emotion of the attack narrowed the
field of consciousness. War cries aided in keeping emotion at fever heat.
"Get the nigger!" "Kill the black â€”â€” of a â€”â€”!" "Kill him!" These
were always an incident of mob action.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Counter-suggestion was not tolerated when the mob was rampant. A
suggestion of clemency was shouted down with the derisive epithet, "Nigger
lover!" Silenced objectors made no further effort to thwart mob action.
There are no records of such persons notifying the police or persisting in their
remonstrances. Those whose objections took the form of action against
the mob met with violence. A white man, an instructor in music at the
University of Chicago, saw several white men attack a Negro who was waiting
for a street car at Sixty-third Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. Without
trying verbal remonstrance he struck out at them. His glasses were knocked
off, and he was thrown into the middle of the street and left unconscious.
</p>

<p>
Not only did action once under way make interference hazardous, but it
brought into the mob circle a greater number of participants and increased
its energy. Five men jerked a trolley from the wires; ten men boarded the
car; twenty-five men chased and beat the routed Negroes. The mob action
grew faster than the increase in numbers. Ideas suggested by individual
members were quickly carried out in the action of all. The mob as a whole
and the individuals in it increased in fury, and a normal street crowd was
often turned from peaceful assemblage to brutal murder.
</p>

<p>
A sharp diversion of attention sometimes caused the dispersal of mobs.
An unexpected revolver shot was the most effective means of such diversion.
Here are some instances:
</p>

<p>
When Thomas Joshua, a Negro boy, was shot by Police Lieutenant Day,
a throng of Negroes came on the run from State Street. The officers, terrified,
escaped in a taxi, leaving their own automobile behind. The mob attempted
to make this car suffer vicariously for the escaped police officers. Other
policemen on the scene had difficulty in holding them back. Two shots were
heard on Federal Street. Immediately the crowd ceased its clamoring, left
the automobile, and apparently lost all thought of Lieutenant Day and ran
to Federal Street.
</p>

<p>
In the first mob of the riot, that at Twenty-ninth Street and Cottage
Grove Avenue, Negroes and policemen were struggling in a mass in the middle
of the street. A shot was fired by James Crawford, and the mob dispersed
from that corner.
</p>

<p>
A mob chased a Negro off a street car on Thirty-ninth Street near Wallace.
A policeman with presence of mind followed the group into the alley,
fired a few shots in the air, and the crowd ran.
</p>

<p>
In no case where an unexpected shot was fired did it fail to scatter the mob,
but shooting which was part of the mob's own action did not seem to have
the same effect.
</p>

<p>
The course of one riotous mob can be traced in the activities of a certain
group of five white boys who linked up with the riot excitement. They met
at the corner of Sixty-third Street and Ingleside Avenue at 8:30 Monday evening.
While they were trying to decide which movie to attend, a taxi driver
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
informed them of a riot at Forty-seventh Street. They took the "L" to Forty-seventh
Street and joined the mob. From then until 2:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> they were
active in mobs which assaulted Negroes at several points. Two were beaten
at Forty-seventh Street and the elevated railway. The mob then proceeded
to Fifty-first Street, but the police drove it back and it moved on to Indiana
Avenue and Forty-third Street, where a deputy sheriff held it off. Returning
here later it attacked a street car, beat a Negro, and then moved south on
Indiana Avenue, jerking trolleys from wires and assaulting passengers. At
Forty-fifth Street a shot fired by a police sergeant scattered it toward Forty-third
Street.
</p>

<p>
There the mob met Lieutenant Washington, a Negro ex-soldier, who, with
five Negro companions, was obliged to walk across town because car service
had been discontinued on account of the rioting. Lieutenant Washington,
testifying before the coroner's jury, gave this account of the affair:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
After we crossed Grand Boulevard I heard a yell, "One, two, three, four, five,
six," and then they gave a loud cheer and said, "Everybody, let's get the niggers!
Let's get the niggers," and we noticed some of them crossed the street and walked
on up even with us. The rest of them were about ten or fifteen feet north ... there
were about between four and six men ... crossed the street and got in front of
us ... just before we got to Forrestville Avenue, about twenty yards, they swarmed
in on us.
</p>
</div>

<p>
After this attack, in which Lieutenant Browning was shot, and Clarence
Metz, a white boy, was killed by a stab wound inflicted by Lieutenant Washington
in self-defense, the mob moved on to Grand Boulevard, preceded by the
rumor that it intended to attack the homes of Negroes. A shot from a house
grazed a white lad, and the crowd went on, leaving the police to come and
arrest the Negroes who had fired.
</p>

<p>
Mob action in planned attacks was more daring, but not more dangerous.
Robbery was occasionally an accompaniment of spontaneous attack, but arson
never. Whether or not some of the organized raids could readily have been
stopped by the police, and the mobs dispersed, remains unproved. No
attempt was made either in the "Loop" district, in the Forty-seventh and
Wells streets districts or in the Sixty-ninth and Elizabeth streets district to
check the depredations.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rumor.</i>â€”Rumor was often the first step in crowd formation and often
opened the way for the sharp transformation of a crowd into a mob. The
circulation of rumors was partly due to natural repetition, often with increasing
embellishment, by one person to another of what he had heard or read. The
desire to tell a "big story" and create a sensation was no doubt an important
factor. With so much bitter feeling there was also considerable conscious
effort to provoke vengeful animosity by telling the worst that the teller had
heard or could imagine about the doings of the opposite race. The latter
type of rumor circulation especially fed the riot from the beginning to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
final clash. It continues to be a constant menace to the friendly relations
of the races.
</p>

<p>
Newspapers were often supplied a source of rumor material through
mistake in fundamental facts, due either to misinformation or exaggeration.
</p>

<p>
In considering the newspaper handling of riot news, it should be borne in
mind that the task was most difficult during a period of such excitement
and such crowding of events. Further it must be considered that white
reporters might very justifiably avoid the risk of seeking news where
crowds of Negroes had been roused to a high pitch of resentment against
whites. There were doubtless instances in which news was secured from
sources ordinarily trustworthy, but inaccurate during the riot. On the other
hand, it must be recognized that in a time of such excitement the effect of
sensational news on the popular mind is generally accentuated, and the responsibility
for careful handling of news is correspondingly greater. Where bias
is as pronounced as in a race riot it is of the utmost importance that essential
facts be stated correctly.

Reports of numbers of dead and injured tended to produce a feeling that
the score must be evened up on the basis of "an eye for an eye," a Negro
for a white, or vice versa. A most unfortunate impression may be made upon
an excited public, Negro and white, by such erroneous reporting as the following,
in which newspapers, although they understated rather than exaggerated
the number of injuries, reported that 6 per cent more whites were injured
than Negroes, when the fact was that 28 per cent more Negroes were injured
than whites.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Tribune</i> of July 29 in a news item said that before 3:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, July 29,
twenty persons had been killed, of whom thirteen were white and seven colored.
The truth was that of twenty killed, seven were white and thirteen colored.<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The <i>Daily News</i> of July 29 gave the starting-point of the riot as the Angelus
clash, referring to it as "the center of the trouble." The same item mentioned
the spread to the Stock Yards district. The fact was that the assault upon
street cars in the Stock Yards district Monday afternoon and rumors of
further brutalities there helped to start the Angelus riot Monday evening.<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
The <i>Tribune</i> of July 30 stated that "the Black Belt continues to be the
center of conflict." Up to July 30 the "Black Belt" had witnessed 120
injuries, while the district west of Wentworth Avenue had had 139. For the
entire riot period the "Black Belt" furnished 34 per cent of the total number
of injuries, and the district west of Wentworth Avenue 41 per cent.
</p>

<p>
Exaggeration in news reports, when popular excitement is at a high pitch,
is peculiarly dangerous. For the very reason that the essential fact seems
authenticated by the simultaneous appearance of the gist of the report in
several papers, the individual reader is the more inclined to believe such
exaggerations as may appear in his favorite journal.
</p>

<p>
Cases of exaggeration could be adduced from every Chicago newspaper,
but a typical one is the report in the <i>Chicago Daily News</i> of July 29 concerning
the killing of Harold Brignadello, white. This item said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Four women and nine men are held at the South Clark Street Station after their
arrest at 1021 South State Street, where they had a formidable arsenal.
</p>

<p>
Harry Signadell [<i>sic</i>], 35, white, died on the way to St. Luke's Hospital shortly
before noon after his bullet-riddled body had been picked up by the police in front of
1021 South State Street, where a colored woman and 20 other Negroes had barricaded
themselves and were shooting at all whites who passed the place.
</p>

<p>
Other persons arrested included Kate Elder, 26 years old, who gave her home as
the State Street address. In all, four women and nine men were made prisoners at
the raid on the place which was found to be an arsenal for the Negro rioters. Two
revolvers, two rifles, an axe, several knives, and several hundred rounds of ammunition,
including 38 and 48 [<i>sic</i>] calibre cartridges, were discovered piled up near the
window from which the Negroes had been shooting.
</p>

<p>
Patrolman John Hayes, of the South Clark Street Station, heard the shots fired
by the Negroes who were firing from the house and saw the spurts of fire from their
rifles and revolvers whenever whites ventured to pass the place. An unknown white
man, a victim of the Negroes' bullets, was found lying on the sidewalk. He was
rushed to St. Luke's Hospital where he died.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The facts of this case, as reported by the coroner's jury are as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
... Harold Brignadello ... came to his death on the 29th day of July,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1919, at St. Luke's Hospital from shock and hemorrhage due to a bullet wound
in the chest cavity.
</p>

<p>
[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>â€”"a bullet wound," not "bullet-riddled."]
</p>

<p>
We find the deceased while standing at the southwest corner of State and Taylor
... was shot and wounded by a bullet fired from the revolver held in the hand
of one Emma Jackson who was standing at an open window on the second floor of
the premises at 1021 South State Street.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Testimony shows that just prior to the shooting, said premises had been stoned
by a mob of white men.
</p>

<p>
We, the jury, recommend that the said Emma Jackson, said Kate Elder, said
John Webb, said Ed. Robinson, and said Clarence Jones be held to the grand jury
upon a charge of murder until discharged by due process of law.
</p>

<p>
[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>â€”Two women and three men, not "four women and nine men," nor yet
"a colored woman and 20 other Negroes." They were indicted by the grand jury
but found not guilty.]
</p>

<p>
We believe from the evidence that the police have sufficient information as to the
identity of some of said white men to warrant arrest, and we recommend such action
be taken.
</p>

<p>
[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>â€”No arrests of men in the white mob were made.]
</p>
</div>

<p>
The testimony further showed that there were 150 white men in the mob
grouped in front of 1021, and four of the men were stoning the house at the
time Emma Jackson fired into their midst.
</p>

<p>
Only one gun was found and no stores of ammunition, instead of "a
formidable arsenal," or a "barricade" or "an arsenal for Negro rioters," or
"two revolvers, two rifles, an axe, several knives, and several hundred rounds
of ammunition, including 38 and 48 [<i>sic</i>] calibre cartridges ... piled up
near the window from which the Negroes had been shooting." The one gun
was hidden in a niche in the skylight.
</p>

<p>
Following are examples of rumors current during the riot and disseminated
by the press and by word of mouth, grouped on the basis of the emotions
which they arousedâ€”vengeful animosity, fear, anger, and horror:
</p>

<p>
<i>Daily News</i>, July 30. Subheadline: "Alderman Jos. McDonough Tells
How He Was Shot at on South Side Visit. Says Enough Ammunition in
Section to Last for Years of Guerrilla Warfare":
</p>

<p>
[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>â€”The reference in the headline to the large amount of ammunition
is repeated in the text, but not elaborated or explained.]
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
An alderman in an account of his adventures says the Mayor contemplates opening
up 35th and 47th streets in order that colored people might get to their work. He
thinks this would be most unwise for, he states, "They are armed and the white
people are not. We must defend ourselves if the city authorities won't protect us."
Continuing his story, he describes bombs going off, "I saw white men and women
running through the streets dragging children by the hands and carrying babies in
their arms. Frightened white men told me the police captains had just rushed
through the district crying, 'For God's sake, arm. They are coming, we cannot
hold them.'"

<p class="caption">NEGROES AND WHITES LEAVING THE STOCK YARDS</p>
</div>

<p>
The point here is not whether the alderman was correctly quoted, but the
effect on the public of such statements attributed to him. There is no record
in any of the riot testimony in the coroner's office or in the state's attorney's
office of any bombs exploded during the riot, nor of police captains warning
white people to arm, nor of any fear on the part of whites of a Negro invasion.
In the Berger Odman case before the coroner's jury there is a statement that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
a police sergeant warned the Negroes of Ogden Park to arm and to shoot at
the feet of rioters if they attempted to invade the few blocks marked off for
Negroes by the police.
</p>

<p>
<i>Herald-Examiner</i>, July 28. Subheadline: "Negroes Have Arms":
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A man whose name is withheld reported to the <i>Herald-Examiner</i> that Negroes
had more than 2,000 Springfield rifles and an adequate supply of soft-nosed bullets.
R. R. Jackson, alderman from the second ward, brands the story as untrue.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This statement is not substantiated.
</p>

<p>
<i>Herald-Examiner</i>, July 29:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Several thousand men stoned the old Eighth Regiment Armory in the heart of
the riot zone, doors were burst in, and hundreds of guns with ammunition taken by
the mob. Police rushed to the scene firing into the mob and finally drove it from the
armory. According to reports more than 50 persons were shot or otherwise injured.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Refutation of this statement is found in the testimony of Police Captain
Mullen before the coroner's jury in the Eugene Williams case:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I received a rumor that the soldiers [referring to Negro soldiers of the Eighth
Regiment] had gone over to the armory for the sole purpose of breaking in and getting
rifles. I dispatched two patrol wagons full of men; after arriving there, we found
out they had been there and broke some windows, but they found out there were
no weapons in there.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another type of fear-provoking rumor current in street crowds reported the
force and the aggressive plans of the opposing race. Some of these rumors, current
among Negro crowds, were to the effect that a white mob was gathering on
Wentworth Avenue ready to break into the "Black Belt"; that a white mob
was waiting to break through at Sixtieth and Ada streets; that a white mob
was ready to advance upon Twenty-seventh and Dearborn streets. The first
of these rumors had its effect upon the inception of the Angelus riot, and the
second so aroused the fears of Negroes that when a white mob led by young
white boys did step over the "dead-line" boundaries established by the police,
guns were immediately turned upon them, and one of the invaders was killed.
Of the third rumor, Police Lieutenant Burns said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
... an old colored man came to me ... and said that the colored people on
Dearborn Street in the 2800 block were moving out in fear of a white mob coming
from across the tracks from across Wentworth Avenue.... On the southwest
corner of Twenty-eighth and Dearborn I found a number of colored men standing in
front of a building there. They had pieces of brick and stone in their pockets and
were peering around the corner west on Twenty-eighth Street apparently in great fear.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Among the whites fear was not so prevalent. A fear-producing rumor
was revealed, however, in the examination of two deputy sheriffs who fired
on a Negro. The deputies had heard that Negroes were going to burn up
or blow up factories in the district which they were patrolling. When a dark
form was seen in an alley, panic seized both deputies, and they emptied their
revolvers at an innocent Negro who lived in the adjoining house.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Chief among the anger-provoking rumors were tales of injury done to
women of the race circulating the rumor. The similarity of the stories and
their persistence shows extraordinary credulity on the part of the public. For
the most horrible of these rumors, telling of the brutal killing of a woman and
baby (sometimes the story is told of a Negro woman, sometimes of a white)
there was no foundation in fact. The story was circulated not only by the
newspapers of both races, but was current always in the crowds on the streets.
Here is the story as told in the white press:
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Tribune</i>, July 29:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There is an account of "two desperate revolver battles fought by the police with
colored men alleged to have killed two white women and a white child."
</p>

<p>
It is reported that policemen saw two Negroes knock down a woman and child
and kick them. The Negroes ran before the police could reach them.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Herald-Examiner</i>, July 29:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Two white women, one of them with a baby in her arms, were attacked and
wounded by Negro mobs firing on street cars....
</p>

<p>
A colored woman with a baby in her arms was reported at the Deering Police
Station, according to this item, to have been attacked by a mob of more than 100 white
men. When the mob finally fled before the approach of a squad of police both the
woman and child were lying in the street beaten to death, "it is said."
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Daily News</i>, July 29:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Another man is held at the Stock Yards station charged with the murder of a
white woman in West 47th Street and Wentworth....
</p>

<p>
The Negroes, four in number, were arrested at East 39th and Cottage Grove
Avenue, this afternoon by the detective. They are believed to be the ones who
seriously wounded Mrs. Margaret Kelley, white woman, at W. 47th and Wentworth.
She was shot in the back and may die. The names of those under arrest were not
given out.
</p>

<p>
[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>â€”"Murder" changed to "seriously injured" in the main story. Mrs.
Mary Kelly was shot in the arm according to the police report and not in the back.]
</p>
</div>

<p>
The men arrested for the shooting were Henry Harris and Scott Brown,
deputy sheriffs, and four others according to the records of the state's attorney.
Sheriff Peters says of the case, that Harris was charged with shooting someone,
but when the case came up the charge was dropped. Sheriff Peters was convinced
that Harris was innocent.
</p>

<p>
<i>Daily News</i>, July 29. Headline, given place of first importance in the
pink section: "Women Shot as Riots Grow." Columns 7 and 8 of first-page
white section are headed, "Attack White Women as Race Riots Grow. Death
Roster Is 30."
</p>

<p>
The item reads: "Race rioters began to attack white women this afternoon
according to report received at the Detective Bureau and the Stock Yards
Police Station." The article continues, that Swift &amp; Company had not
received any such reports of attacks on their women employees. But farther
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
on the item gives an account of a Swift &amp; Company truck filled with girl
employees fired upon by Negroes at Forty-seventh Street and the Panhandle
railroad. The driver was reported killed and several of the girls injured.
</p>

<p>
The juxtaposition of "Death roster is 30" and "Attack white women"
gives a wrong impression. The "several girls injured" at Forty-seventh
Street evidently refers to the case of Mrs. Mary Kelly. The records of the
state's attorney's office also show that Josephine Mansfield was supposed to
have been wounded by Harris, <i>et al.</i>, but the charge was dropped. She was
wounded in the shoulder, according to the police report.
</p>

<p>
<i>Daily News</i>, July 30:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Alderman McDonough described a raid into the white district the night before
by a carload of colored men who passed Thirty-fifth Street and Wallace "shouting
and shooting." The gunmen shot down a woman and a little boy who stood close by.
</p>

<p>
[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>â€”No record of such a case.]
</p>

<p>
Here is the "injury done to women" story as it appeared in the Negro press:
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Defender</i>, August 2:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
An unidentified young woman and three-months-old baby were found dead on
the street at the intersection of Forty-seventh and Wentworth. She had attempted
to board a car there when the mob seized her, beat her, slashed her body to ribbons,
and beat the baby's brains out against a telegraph pole. Not satisfied with this one
rioter severed her breasts and a white youngster bore it aloft on a pole triumphantly
while the crowd hooted gleefully. The whole time this was happening several policemen
were in the crowd but did not make any attempt to make a rescue until too late.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Concerning all of these stories it may be stated that the coroner had no
cases of deaths of women and children brought before him. There was nothing
in the police reports or the files of the state's attorney or hospital reports or
the reports of Olivet Baptist Church, which would give any foundation for
reports of the killing of a woman and child, white or Negro.
</p>

<p>
There were other rumors which had the same anger-producing effect as
reports of attacks on women. A notable case of this kind was the fatal clash
at the Angelus, an apartment house for white people at Thirty-fifth Street
and Wabash Avenue, on Monday, July 28 (see <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>). The trouble here
grew from four o'clock in the afternoon until it culminated in the shooting
at 8:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The excitement was stimulated by the rapid spread of various
rumors. It was said that a white mob was gathering at Thirty-fifth Street
and Wentworth Avenue, only a few blocks from the colored mob which was
massed on Thirty-fifth Street from State Street to Wabash Avenue. The
rumor was that the white men are armed and prepared to "clean up the
'Black Belt.'" Another rumor had it that a Negro's sister had been killed
while coming home from the Stock Yards where she worked. Finally came
the rumor that a white person had fired a shot from the Angelus building,
wounding a colored boy. The rumor quickly went through the crowd swarming
around the building, but no one heard or saw the shooting. A search of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
building disclosed no firearms. Police Sergeant Middleton, Negro, described
the situation as "everybody trying to tell you something and you couldn't
get anything." Another Negro policeman said it was "just a rumor that
went around through the crowd and everybody was saying, 'He shot from
that window'; I would go to that window and the crowd would say, 'That is
the window over there.'"
</p>

<p>
The anger-provoking power of rumor was seen in the ensuing clash. About
1,500 Negroes massed on one corner of Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash Avenue,
and about 100 policemen grouped themselves at the intersection of the two
streets. At the sight of a brick flying from the Negro mob the police fired a
volley into the midst of the mob. More shots came quickly from both sides.
Four Negroes were killed, and many were injured, among both the Negroes
and the police.
</p>

<p>
The Angelus rumor appeared as follows in a Negro newspaper, the <i>Chicago
Defender</i>, August 2: "White occupants of the Angelus apartments began
firing shots and throwing missiles from their windows. One man was shot
through the head but before his name could be secured he was spirited away."
</p>

<p>
In the case of Joseph Lovings, a Negro killed by an Italian mob, press
reports that were entirely false tended strongly to provoke the anger of Negro
mobs. For example:
</p>

<p>
<i>Herald-Examiner</i>, July 30: "He had been shot, stabbed and gasoline had
been thrown on his body which had been set afire. The police extinguished
the fire and took the body to the County Morgue."
</p>

<p>
<i>Tribune</i>, July 30: "This report says that he was stabbed and shot sixteen
times, then his body saturated with gasoline and set afire."
</p>

<p>
The coroner's jury in commenting on this rumor said: "It gives us satisfaction
to say that this rumor, from our investigation, is false and unsubstantiated."
</p>

<p>
Among the horror rumors one finds such examples as the story of the white
man who stood at the entrance to Exchange Avenue and knocked down half
a dozen Negroes as they came by. This was current in the Stock Yards and
was told by one of the workers at the inquest on the body of William Dozier,
Negro, killed in the Yards. Another rumor had it that a Negro woman
nicknamed "Heavy" had partly slashed off the head of a white man. This
was picked up by a detective circulating among white people living in the
"Black Belt."
</p>

<p>
But chief among horror rumors was the Bubbly Creek rumor, which took
this form in the press:
</p>

<p>
<i>Daily News</i>, July 29. Subheadline: "Four Bodies in Bubbly Creek."
The article does not give details but says, "Bodies of four colored men were
taken today from Bubbly Creek in the Stock Yards district, it is reported."
</p>

<p>
This was one of the most persistent rumors of the riot, and intelligent men
were found repeating it in half-credulous tones. A meat curer, talking in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
superintendent's office of Swift &amp; Company, said: "Well, I hear they did
drag two or three out of Bubbly Creek.... Dead bodies, that is the report
that came to the Yards, but personally I never got any positive evidence that
there was any people who was found there."
</p>

<p>
A juror on the coroner's panel said: "A man told a friend of mineâ€”I can
furnish the name of that manâ€”a man told him that he saw fifty-six bodies
taken out of Bubbly Creek. They made a statement they used a net and seine
to drag them out."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Williams, Negro attorney, said he was told that the bodies of 100
Negroes had been found in Bubbly Creek.
</p>

<p>
In its final report, the coroner's jury made this conclusive statement
regarding the Bubbly Creek rumor:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Bubbly Creek has been the favorite cemetery for the undiscovered dead, and our
inquiry has been partly directed to that stream. In our inquiry we have been assisted
by the Stock Yards officials and workers, by adjacent property owners and residents,
by private detective bureaus, the Police Department, Department of Health, State's
Attorney's office, by observing and intelligent colored citizens, and by other agencies,
and we are firmly of the opinion that these reports, so widely circulated, are erroneous,
misleading, and without foundation in fact, the race riot victims numbering thirty-eight,
and no more, nor are there any colored citizens reported to us as missing.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Rumor, fermenting in mobs, prepares the mob mind for the direct suggestion
impelling otherwise law-abiding citizens to atrocities. Another more insidious
and potentially more dangerous result is the slow accumulation of feeling which
builds between the white and Negro the strongest barrier of race prejudice.
</p>

<p>
<i>Police.</i>â€”There has been much criticism of the manner in which the riot
was handled by the authorities, but it may be pointed out that the riot was
not quelled until at least four groups of peace guardians had taken part in
handling it. The two most important groups were the police and the militia;
the others were composed of deputy sheriffs and Negro ex-soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Testimony before the coroner's jury and in hearings before this Commission
throws considerable light on the actions of the Police Department as a whole
during the riot, its methods in meeting the unusual situation, and on the
conduct of individual policemen. First-hand information and opinion was
obtained from Chief of Police Garrity and State's Attorney Hoyne.
</p>

<p>
The police had two severe handicaps at the outset of the rioting. The first,
as declared by Chief Garrity, was lack of sufficient numbers adequately to
cope with the situation. The coroner's jury found that "the police force
should be enlarged. It is too small to cope with the needs of Chicago." The
grand jury added: "The police force is also inadequate in numbers, and
at least one thousand (1,000) officers should be added to the existing force."
This number approximates the need urged by Chief Garrity, who, when
asked before the Commission as to the sufficiency of his force, answered:
"No. I haven't sufficient force. I haven't got a sufficient force now to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
properly police the city of Chicago by one-third." Militia officers and other
police officials held the same general opinion.
</p>

<p>
The second handicap, distrust of white policemen by all Negroes, while
implied and not admitted by Chief Garrity, was frankly explained by State's
Attorney Hoyne. He said before the Commission: "There is no doubt that a
great many police officers were grossly unfair in making arrests. They shut
their eyes to offenses committed by white men while they were very vigorous
in getting all the colored men they could get."
</p>

<p>
Leaders among the Negroes clearly indicate that discrimination in arrest
was a principal cause of widespread and long-standing distrust. Whether
justified or not, this feeling was actual and bitter. This distrust had grown
seriously during the six months preceding the riot because no arrests were
made in bombing cases. State's Attorney Hoyne said before the commission:
"I don't know of a single case where the police have apprehended any
man who has blown up a house."
</p>

<p>
Charles S. Duke, a well-educated and fair-minded Negro, gave his reaction
to the bombings when he said that he did not "believe a Negro would have
been allowed to go unpunished five minutes." Mrs. Clarke, Negro, said her
house was bombed three times, once while a plain-clothes policeman was inside
waiting for bombers, but no arrests were made. One suspect was put under
surveillance but was not held.
</p>

<p>
The trial of the three Negro policemen before the Merit Committee of
the Police Department because they refused to use the "Jim Crow" sleeping-quarters
in a police station doubtless added to race feeling, particularly in
view of the publicity it received in the "Black Belt."
</p>

<p>
Negro distrust of the police increased among the Negroes during the
period of the riot. With each clash a new cause for suspicion seemed to
spring up. The most striking instance occurred on the first afternoon when
Policeman Callahan refused to arrest the white man whom the Negro crowd
accused of causing the drowning of Williams, the Negro boy. This refusal
has been called the beginning of the riot because it led to mob violence of grave
consequences. However that may have been, the fact remains that this
refusal was heralded broadcast by the Negroes as the kind of action they
might expect from the police.
</p>

<p>
Typical of the minor tales which laid the foundation for the Negroes'
bitterness toward this white policeman are the following:
</p>

<p>
1. Kin Lumpkin, Negro, was beaten by a mob on the "L" platform at
Forty-seventh Street, as he was going home from work. The policeman
arrested Lumpkin and had him booked for rioting. No other arrests were
made. Lumpkin was held from July 28 to August 1.
</p>

<p>
2. Two policemen, one of them Officer McCarty of the Twenty-sixth
Precinct, witnessed the beating of Wellington Dunmore, Negro, of 4120
South Campbell Avenue, but, according to the victim, refused to assist him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
</p>

<p>
3. John Slovall and brother, Negroes, were beaten and robbed by whites
in sight of a white policeman. No arrests were made. The officer did not
even call for aid.
</p>

<p>
4. While looking for his mother at Thirty-first and State streets on Tuesday,
July 29, Wm. F. Thornton, Negro, 3207 South Park Avenue, asked a policeman
to take him home. The officer took him to the police station and locked him
up. Another Negro applied for protection, but the police searched him,
clubbed him, and when he ran, the sergeant told another policeman to shoot
him. The policeman obeyed and the man fell under the "L" station. He was
picked up by the same patrol wagon that took Thornton to the Cottage
Grove Police Station. The officer, Bundy, arrested Thornton.

<p>
A report on 229 Negroes and whites accused of various criminal activities
disclosed the fact that 154 were Negroes and seventy-five were whites. The
state's attorney reported eighty-one indictments against Negroes and forty-seven
against whites after all riot cases were cleared up. These figures show
that twice as many Negroes appeared as defendants and twice as many were
indicted as whites.
</p>

<p>
At first glance these figures indicate greater riot activity on the part of
Negroes, and therefore one would expect to find twice as many whites injured
as Negroes. But out of a total of 520 injured persons whose race was definitely
reported, 342 were Negroes and 178 whites. The fact that twice as many
Negroes appeared as defendants and twice as many were injured as whites suggests
the conclusion that whites were not apprehended as readily as Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Herman M. Adler, state criminologist of Illinois, testifying before the
Commission, expressed the belief that the police showed much more readiness
to arrest Negroes than whites because the officers thought they were "taking
fewer chances if they 'soaked' a colored man."
</p>

<p>
Negro distrust of police and courts seems to have been confirmed by
the action of the state's attorney's office in bringing only Negro riot cases
before the grand jury. This body, however, took a stand for fair play and
justice for both sides, and though its action may have been novel, it was effective.
In its final report, the grand jury said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
This jury has no apology to offer for its attitude with reference to requesting the
state's attorney to supply it with information of crimes perpetrated by whites against
blacks before considering further evidence against blacks. This attitude gave rise
to the reports in the press that this grand jury "had gone on a strike." As a matter
of fact, its position was merely a suspension of hearing further cases of crimes committed
by blacks against whites until the state's attorney submitted evidence concerning
the various crimes committed by whites against blacks. The reason for this
attitude arose from a sense of justice on the part of this jury. It is the opinion of
this jury that the colored people suffered more at the hands of the white hoodlums
than the white people suffered at the hands of the black hoodlums. Notwithstanding
this fact, the cases presented to this jury against the blacks far outnumber those
against the whites.
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
</p>

<p>
State's Attorney Hoyne justified this action by saying that the Police
Department brought in Negroes only, and until they arrested whites, he was
limited to proceedings against Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The coroner's jury on November 3, 1919, reported as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Our attention was called strikingly to the fact that at the time of race rioting,
the arrests made for rioting by the police of colored rioters were far in excess of the
arrests made of white rioters. The failure of the police to arrest impartially, at the
time of rioting, whether from insufficient effort or otherwise, was a mistake and had
a tendency to further incite and aggravate the colored population.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This seeming discrimination in arrests naturally deepened Negro distrust
and lack of confidence in the police. Testimony was taken by the Commission
on the plans and action of the Police Department during the riot period,
since the Commission felt that the distribution of forces and the methods
used by the department to meet such an emergency were matters of first
importance.
</p>

<p>
Chief of Police Garrity testified that there were 3,500 policemen in the
department at the time of the riot, and that he had "practically every policeman
in the city of Chicago down there," indicating Thirty-fifth Street and Rhodes
Avenue as "practically in the heart of the district where the most trouble was."
The widest distribution from that center, he said, was over an area bounded
by Lake Michigan, Ashland Avenue, Van Buren Street, and Sixty-ninth Street.
</p>

<p>
The heaviest concentration of police, however, was in the "Black Belt."
The Stanton Avenue Police Station at Thirty-fifth Street and Rhodes Avenue
is at about the center of the most congested Negro residential area. Asked
how many policemen were assigned to that vicinity (the area from Twenty-second
to Thirty-ninth streets), Chief Garrity said, "We had in the neighborhood
of 2,800 men in that territory." Later the chief said only "the necessary
sergeants and one or two men at each station were held back for emergency
calls" in all other parts of the city. This means that four-fifths of the total
police force was concentrated there.
</p>

<p>
Although there is no direct testimony as to the existence of flying squadrons
of police, yet such bodies appear to have been operating. Probably the most
important of these was the patrol under Police Captain Mullen, who said
that his territory extended from Twenty-second to Thirty-ninth streets and
from the lake to the Rock Island tracks, or roughly the "Black Belt." Chief
Deputy Alcock<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> sent eighty-eight policemen into this district on Sunday
afternoon, twenty-five more at midnight, and fifty more on Monday morning.
</p>

<p>
In describing the disposition of police details, Chief Garrity said: "They
were routed by him [Alcock] according to conditions existing in different districts.
Some districts might have a hundred men in the block and in the
next block there might be only ten, according to what conditions were."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
Forces were moved from one point of disturbance to another by means of
patrol wagons on request of local commanders.
</p>

<p>
The 2,800 policemen in the "Black Belt" were under the command of
Chief Deputy Alcock with headquarters in the Stanton Avenue Station. He
"used his discretion in the number of men assigned to the different points
and the handling of them in the different territories."
</p>

<p>
Riot orders were given by Chief Garrity as follows: "Wherever possible
suppress the riot and restore peace"; "the second day I ordered a dead line
on Wentworth Avenue and Twenty-second Street to, I think, Sixty-third
Street"; "instructions were that 'you will allow no colored people to go across
to the west and no white people to go across to the east.'" Cabarets, saloons,
and public places were ordered closed, and all large gatherings of either whites
or Negroes were prohibited from Van Buren to Sixty-ninth streets and from
Ashland Avenue to the lake. The chief added, "Closing clubrooms and
everything in the district west of Wentworth Avenue as well as east of it."
A general policy was adopted of search and seizure of persons suspected of
carrying weapons on the street, and of houses from which firing came. Captain
Mullen testified before the coroner's jury at the Eugene Williams inquest
that on July 29 Chief Deputy Alcock lined up the policemen in front of the
Stanton Avenue Station and gave them their orders. They were told to
"preserve the peace; that was all."
</p>

<p>
Police records of clashes were incomplete and often inaccurate. This
was in part due, and naturally so, to the stress of the moment. In many
cases the station lists of injured were far from complete and in few instances
were the names of witnesses given. Even the dates and hours of clashes were
loosely recorded. Persons arrested were frequently not booked at all, while
on the other hand it was not uncommon to find innocent persons charged
with serious offenses. Henry Scholz, policeman of the Twenty-sixth Precinct,
threw much light on police records while being examined in connection with
certain automobile arrests:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
They were all discharged, booked for "disorderly," because we couldn't find
the guns in the mix-up. It was the first or second day down there and they were
bringing them in right and left, and I suppose in the mix-up they mislaid the guns,
or put them away somewhere, or booked them to someone else. We held them
about a week trying to find the guns and trying to find the officers that got the guns.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is important to know how the distribution and routing of police affected
the general riot situation. As already shown four-fifths of the police forces
were concentrated in the "Black Belt." This undoubtedly both weakened
police forces elsewhere and also prevented or delayed reinforcements in outside
districts. Only 34 per cent of the total number of reported injuries occurred
in the area of concentration. Negro hatred of the police is worth mentioning
again here, especially since many of the deaths and injuries occurred during
clashes between white policemen and Negro mobs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
</p>

<p>
That other districts where danger existed were poorly protected is shown
by the fact that fatal clashes occurred there without interruption by the
police. The most conspicuous case is noted in the "Loop" atrocities on July
29, where two Negroes, Hardwick and Williams, were killed, several were
injured and robbed, and business property of whites was damaged. A police
sergeant said that only three officers and one sergeant were in the district
on the night of July 28-29. In the Stock Yards district, where 41 per cent
of the injuries and several deaths occurred, there is no record of an attempt by
the police to increase the riot forces. In this district gang raids by whites
were practically beyond control. On July 28 B. F. Hardy, a Negro, was
killed at Forty-sixth Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. Sergeant Clancy
later testified that there were no policemen in this district until after the
trouble. The foreman of the grand jury investigated the activities of the
Deering Street Station under Police Captain Gallery. He says: "They
didn't have a sufficient number of policemen to handle the situation. If I
remember correctly, he had eight patrolmen covering a district of any number
of square miles."
</p>

<p>
In spite of the concentration of police in the "Black Belt" some parts of
that area seem at times not to have been properly guarded. Several serious
clashes occurred there after the police arrived in force. Theodore Copling,
Negro, was shot to death at Thirtieth and State streets in the heart of the
"Black Belt" on July 30. This had been a riotous corner for three days,
yet no policemen were at hand. The nearest was a detective sergeant on
Twenty-ninth Street between Federal and State streets. Samuel Banks,
Negro, was shot and killed near the corner of Twenty-seventh and Dearborn
streets on July 30 at 11:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, yet Lieutenant Burns, in charge of this district,
testified at the inquest that twelve to fourteen officers were at Twenty-seventh
and Dearborn streets immediately before the shooting.
</p>

<p>
It was undoubtedly the relatively large number of clashes which the
police were unable to prevent that led the coroner's jury to recommend that
"(6) there should be organization of the force for riot work for the purpose
of controlling rioting in its incipient stages."
</p>

<p>
The conduct of individual policemen received much adverse criticism from
the Negroes. This was to be expected in the circumstances, but disregarding
the general prejudice of which white officers were accused, certain cases of
discrimination, abuse, brutality, indifference, and neglect on the part of
individuals are deserving of examination.
</p>

<p>
Abusive and brutal treatment was complained of by Horace Jennings,
3422 South Aberdeen Street. He reported to the state's attorney's office that
Policeman Gâ€”â€”, of the Grand Crossing Station, approached him, as he lay
wounded by a mob attack, with the words, "Where's your gun, you black
â€”â€” of a â€”â€”? You damn niggers are raising hell"; that the officer hit him
on the head, and he did not regain consciousness until some time later in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
Burnside Hospital; and he further charged that Gallagher took a purse containing
$13 when he searched him.
</p>

<p>
Three Negroes were rescued by the police from a white mob of twenty-five
or thirty men. Scott, one of the Negroes, was taken from the street car on which
all three were riding, by the command of a policeman to "come out of there,
you big rusty brute, you. I ought to shoot you," and was given a blow on
the head. According to a witness he was again struck by the policeman
as he was pushed into the patrol wagon. He was subjected to rough treatment
at the jail and was kept incommunicado from July 28 to August 4, not being
permitted to notify his wife or an attorney. None of the twenty-five or
thirty white rioters was arrested. There was some evidence of fear on the
part of the police to arrest rioting whites.
</p>

<p>
Fear by policemen of Negroes is also disclosed. George Crumm, white,
124 East Forty-sixth Street, informed the state's attorney's office that he
was beaten by a Negro mob, got police assistance, and pointed out the rioters,
but the police "didn't seem to want to interfere any."
</p>

<p>
On several occasions policemen left the scene of riots on questionable
excuses while the rioting was in progress. Of the three mounted policemen
at Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash Avenue who rushed to the spot where a
mob was attacking Otterson, two accompanied the automobile of Otterson
to the hospital. The mob was not quelled or dispersed. When the house of
William O'Deneal, Negro, 4742 Wells Street, was attacked, the police took
O'Deneal to the station and left the mob to sack and burn his house. At the
killing of William Dozier, Negro, all three police officers who responded to
notice of an attack by a white mob of 300 or more, left in the same patrol
wagon. The names of witnesses were not taken. It was the custom for all
to accompany the wagon, according to Officer McDonough.
</p>

<p>
Political "pull" exercised with the police on behalf of rioters has been
indicated. It was noted that one of "Ragen's Colts" said an officer of the
Stock Yards Station "tipped them off" to stay away from their club because
Attorney General Brundage's office was out investigating them.
</p>

<p>
Indifference both to extreme lawlessness during the riot and to the procedure
of the inquest marked the examination of Captain of Police Mullen before the
coroner's jury. He was in command of twelve mounted men and between
sixty-three and 100 men on foot at Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash Avenue
when a clash between the police and a Negro mob occurred. While it appears
to be the fact that he left just before the heavy firing to telephone from a saloon
one block away, yet the building he was in was struck by bullets. The following
excerpt from the inquest speaks for itself:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Q.</i>: What time did the shooting take place at the building known as the
Angelus Building? What time did that occur? Was there any shooting at that

you left?
</p>

<p>
<i>Mullen</i>: Not to my knowledge.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
Three men were killed and many injured at Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash
Avenue at this time. Firing broke out near-by almost immediately.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Q.</i>: There were some shots fired at Thirty-fifth and State, Captain, at eight that
night, right after the volley was fired, we have absolute evidence.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mullen</i>: Well, you may have, but I have not.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Yet Captain Mullen was in command of the police who killed two more
men and inflicted other wounds when the Negroes ran before the police
advance.

<p>
<i>Militia.</i>â€”The rapid growth of the riot both in violence and territorially
created such alarm among the authorities and the public that the question of
its control became a matter of paramount concern to the community. Before
twenty-four hours had elapsed requests were made to the local authorities
for the militia. The representations were based on insufficiency of police
forces and were strongly urged before the chief of police.
</p>

<p>
Chief Garrity steadily refused to ask for troops, in spite of his repeated
statement that the police force was insufficient. He gave as his reason the
belief that inexperienced militiamen would add to the deaths and disorders.
Mayor Thompson supported the chief's refusal until outside pressure compelled
him to ask the governor for aid. On the other hand the chief deputy of police
was quoted by State's Attorney Hoyne as having said at the outbreak of the
riot that the police would not be able to handle the situation, and that troops
were needed. In this he was supported by Mr. Hoyne. From observation
of conditions on the first three days of the riot, the chief of staff of the troops,
Colonel Ronayne, concluded that the police were insufficient in numbers,
that no improvement was apparent in the general situation, and that therefore
the troops were necessary. He saw no reason, however, for putting the city
under martial law. Other military men were of the same opinion.
</p>

<p>
During all of this time Governor Lowden kept in close touch with the
situation from his quarters at the Blackstone Hotel. When the riot appeared
to be subsiding he started to keep an appointment out of town but, on hearing
that there was a renewal of violence, returned to the city on a special train.
When the request was made for the active co-operation of the troops he acted
with promptness.
</p>

<p>
The troops themselves were clearly of high caliber. For the most part
they were in home service during the war and were older men than are ordinarily
found in militia organizations. They "usually came from the higher
type of business men, men of affairs, men that knew how to think," as one of
their commanding officers described them. They were all American-born.

</div>

<p>
The militia discipline was of the best. Not a single case of breach of
discipline was reported to the regimental commanders. No guardhouse
was necessary during the riot, a remarkable commentary on troop conduct.
</p>

<p>
The militia had been given special drills in the suppression of riots and
insurrections for a year and a half previous to this occasion, and were, in the
estimation of their commanding officer, "probably better prepared for riot
drill than any troops ever put on duty in the state."
</p>

<p>
The activities of the militia did not begin as early as many citizens wished.
Though troops began to mobilize in the armories on Monday night, July 28,
they were not called to actual duty on the streets until 10:30 P.M., Wednesday,
July 30. When called to active duty they were distributed in the areas of
conflict. Between 5,000 and 6,000 troops were called out. This number was
made up entirely of white troops from the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Infantry,
Illinois National Guard, and from the First, Second, Third, and Fourth
Reserve Militia regiments of the militia. Colored troops who had composed
the Eighth Regiment were not reorganized at that time, and therefore none
participated.
</p>

<p>
Distribution of troops was determined not by the militia command but
by the police, because the city was not under martial law, the civil authority
being merely insufficient, not broken. The Third Infantry covered the
territory from Thirty-first to Thirty-eighth streets and from State to Halsted
streets; Eleventh Infantry from Thirty-ninth to Forty-seventh streets, and
from State to Halsted streets; Tenth Infantry from Forty-eighth to Fifty-fifth
streets (later extended to Sixty-third Street by details from the First Infantry),
and from Cottage Grove to Stewart avenues. The First, Fourth, and Ninth
Infantry were held in reserve. Detachments responded to calls from the chief
of police in districts outside these areas. Headquarters for the commanding
general and his chief of staff were in the Congress Hotel at the northern boundary
of the riot zone.
</p>

<p>
The orders under which the militia operated did not have the authority
of martial law. The purpose of the orders was to effect a thorough co-operation
with the police only, and not to take over any duties other than the preservation
of law and order. Except in this respect, civilian routine remained undisturbed.
The method of co-operation put the commanding officer of a regiment in
absolute control, within the limits above described, in his district. The
police reduced their number to normal requirements by removing their reserves
as soon as the militia moved in. The patrolmen then went about on ordinary
duties in the districts. Persons arrested by the militia were turned over to
the police.
</p>

<p>
Responsibility for the preservation of law and order rested on the regimental
commanders. Careful instructions were given troops for preventing
violence: they were to act as soldiers in a gentlemanly manner; they were furnished
with arms to enable them to perform their duties; they were to use the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
arms only when necessary; they were to use bayonet and butt in preference
to firing, but if the situation demanded shooting, they were not to hesitate
to deliver an effective fire. Above all, the formation of mobs was to be prevented.
</p>

<p>
The manner in which the militia was received by various elements in the
communities where stationed is illuminating. Police officers were glad that
the troops came to relieve them. Two policemen on duty with a patrol
exclaimed, when they heard the militia had come in force, "Thank God!
We can't stand up under this much longer!" The police at Cottage Grove
Avenue said, "We are tickled to death to see you fellows come in; you have
never looked so good to us before!" A regimental commander said his organization
was "welcomed into the zone, of course, by everybody, and I'd say
especially by the colored people." A similar report came from another
regimental commander.
</p>

<p>
But there was some show of hostility to the troops. Hoodlums fired on
some detachments when they first came in, and Colonel Bolte reported a
hatred for the troops by "the Hamburg Athletic Club, the Ragen's, and the
Emeralds, and a whole bunch of them over there who didn't like to be controlled!"
Volunteer ex-service men with no legal status, but who aided the
police at the time, and deputy sheriffs with overseas training ridiculed the
militia with such taunts as, "Tin soldiers!" The effect of this attitude on
the populace necessitated the arrest of some disturbers and the removal of
unauthorized persons from the streets.
</p>

<p>
It is a singular fact that militia activities were principally against gangs
of hoodlums, and the majority of these gangs were composed of white youths.
Said one commander, "Rowdies of the white population tried to get through
the lines and had to be arrested." "At one time a heavy truck or two loaded
with white gangsters attempted to break through the militia but was checked."
Plenty of trouble "with the Ragen's and other similar organizations" was
reported by yet another commander.
</p>

<p>
The militia unquestionably prevented mob formations, raids, and "sniping."
They checked marauders still in search of prey. In many cases they
prevented the initial moves of lawlessness by taking stations at critical points
long before raiders arrived.
</p>

<p>
There was a marked contrast between the militia and the police. The
troops were under definite orders; commanders had absolute control of their
forces and knew at all times where and how many effectives were available.
Precision and promptness of movement was the rule. Reserves were always
at hand. Discipline was always good. Only one person, a white man, was
killed by the troops. Whatever other restraining causes contributed, it is
certain that the riot was not revived after the troops were posted.
</p>

<p>
Most of the troops were withdrawn on August 8.
</p>

<p>
<i>Volunteers.</i>â€”Many Negro ex-service men, formerly members of the old
Eighth Regiment (Negro) of the Illinois National Guard, donned their uniforms,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
armed, and offered their services to the police and militia. The militia
on duty found that these Negro volunteers had no authority or military status
and consequently ordered them to disband, which they did.
</p>

<p>
Before the troops were called out, however, a determined effort was made
by one Britton, white police reserve, to organize ex-soldiers for volunteer
service. He said as many as thirty-five joined him. They were denied permits
to carry weapons but are reported to have done so. It was these men who
used an automobile, driven with the mufflers open, to clear the streets.
</p>

<p>
Evidence of the use of liquor was noticed among these men during their
active period. Some were involved in the killing of Samuel Banks, Negro;
some in the robbery of a restaurant and in misdeeds of a minor character.
Following the implication of individuals among them in these crimes, numbers
of the ex-soldiers were arrested by the police, but were released by order of
Chief Garrity on account of the assistance many of them had rendered the
department and because of representations of business men who felt that
the arrests were unjust.
</p>

<p>
<i>Deputy sheriffs.</i>â€”In addition to police, militiamen, and volunteers, another
group composed of specially recruited deputy sheriffs, appeared in the riot
zone as preservers of the peace. They were sworn in by Sheriff Peters, of Cook
County, after citizens had appealed to him, he said, to quell the riot. In regard
to their formation, numbers, orders, and duties, the sheriff had this to say:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I advertised for ex-service men to serve as deputy sheriffs. A thousand or more
applied. They were all men who had returned from the war and were out of work.
I hired 500 of them, kept them in the army uniforms, and instructed them to shoot
to kill any disturbers or rioters. The presence of these men and the show of authority
thereby made was effective, and the riot was quelled.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Fifteen thousand dollars was spent on this force.
</p>

<p>
It appears that these deputies came on the scene toward the end of the
riot week and at once fell into disfavor with the militia, whom they ridiculed
as "tin soldiers" in much the same manner as did the volunteers. Two regimental
commanders of militia said the special deputies "did not behave in a
very pleasant manner" and "in the majority of instances were no good."
The sheriff was notified to call them in and they soon disappeared. There is
no record of organized methods of procedure or of their activities.
</p>

<p>
<i>Restoration of order.</i>â€”Long before actual hostilities ceased, and even
before the arrival of the militia, various agencies, in addition to the police,
were at work trying to hold lawlessness in check and restore order. Efforts
of citizens of both races helped greatly in bringing about peace. As long as
the rioting was in progress thousands of Negroes were cut off from their employment.
The Stock Yards workers especially were affected, since Negroes
living east of Wentworth Avenue would have been forced to go to work on
foot through the district in which the worst rioting occurred. The hostilities
also cut off the food supply in the main riot areas. The dealers in the "Black
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
Belt," principally Jewish merchants, became alarmed lest temporary lack
of funds due to the separation from work and wages should lead Negroes to
loot their stores.
</p>

<p>
On August 1, the various packing companies made the unpaid wages of
Negro employees available for them by establishing pay stations at the Chicago
Urban League at 3032 Wabash Avenue, the Wabash Avenue Young Men's
Christian Association at 3763 Wabash Avenue, the South Side Community
Service House at 3201 South Wabash Avenue, and the Binga State Bank,
Thirty-eighth and State streets. Approximately 6,000 employees were paid
in this way. Banks within the district made small temporary loans to stranded
persons, sometimes without security. The cashier of the Franklin State
Bank at Thirty-fifth Street and Michigan Avenue said that he had made
loans of more than $200 to Negroes in sums of $2 and $3 on their simple promise
to pay, and that every dollar had been repaid.
</p>

<p>
All the local newspapers in their editorial columns took a vigorous stand
against disorder, urged the people to be calm and avoid crowds, and were
insistent that those responsible for rioting should be brought to justice. The
<i>Tribune</i>, for example, published editorials under the following captions:
"Regain Order and Keep It," "Sane Men and Rioters," "This Is No Holiday,"
"The Facts of the Riot," and "Penalties for Rioters." All of these articles
were calm appeals for tolerance, sanity, and dispassionate inquiry for the
facts. The <i>Evening American</i>, in an editorial entitled "This Is Chicago's
Crisis; Keep a Cool Head," said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Chicago is facing its crisis today.
</p>

<p>
In one great section of the city law and order for the time being seem to have been
flung to the four winds. White men and colored men are shooting one another down
in the streets for no earthly cause except that the color of their faces differs.
</p>

<p>
These mobs are not representative of whites or blacks. They are the hoodlums
of both races. But the law abiding whites and blacks are innocent victims.
</p>

<p>
Hotheads and smoking gun barrels have almost wrested the rule from the keepers
of the peace.
</p>

<p>
It is worse than a calamity, this race rioting. It is a deadly, ghastly scourge, a
dire contagion that is sweeping through a community for no reason except that mob
violence is contagious.
</p>

<p>
It is up to the cool-headed men of Chicago to settle the great difficulty. It is up
to the serious-minded business men of the city to get together and find a solution to a
problem which has become so serious.
</p>

<p>
To meet violence with violence is but making matters worse. Gun toting at a
time like this only adds fuel to the fire already raging.
</p>

<p>
Reason is the solution. It is mightier than the six-gun. How it is to be exerted
is for the level-headed citizenry to decide, and decide at once.
</p>

<p>
Hardly an hour passes that more names are not added to the already long list of
slain in the South Side rioting.
</p>

<p>
There is no time to be lost. Other matters must be put aside for the moment
and a solution reached for Chicago's greatest problem.

<p>
Labor unions also took a hand in the efforts toward peace. Unionists of
both races were exhorted to co-operate in bringing about harmonious relations,
and meetings for this purpose were planned by trade-union leaders, as
described in the section of this report dealing with the Negro in industry.
Probably the most effective effort of union labor was the following article
in the <i>New Majority</i>, the organ of the Chicago Federation of Labor, prominently
displayed:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">For White Union Men to Read</span>
</p>

<p>
Let any white union worker who has ever been on strike where gunmen or machine
gun have been brought in and turned on him and his fellows search his memory and
recall how he felt. In this critical moment let every union man remember the tactics
of the boss in a strike when he tries by shooting to terrorize striking workers into
violence to protect themselves.
</p>

<p>
Well, that is how the Negroes feel. They are panic-stricken over the prospect of
being killed.
</p>

<p>
A heavy responsibility rests on the white portion of the community to stop
assault on Negroes by white men. Violence against them is not the way to solve the
vexed race problem.
</p>

<p>
This responsibility rests particularly heavy upon the white men and women of
organized labor, not because they had anything to do with starting the present
trouble, but because of their advantageous position to help end it. Right now it is
going to be decided whether the colored workers are to continue to come into the
labor movement or whether they are going to feel that they have been abandoned by
it and lose confidence in it.
</p>

<p>
It is a critical time for Chicago.
</p>

<p>
It is a critical time for organized labor.
</p>

<p>
All the influence of the unions should be exerted on the community to protect
colored fellow-workers from the unreasoning frenzy of race prejudice. Indications
of the past have been that organized labor has gone further in eliminating race hatred
than any other class. It is up against the acid test now to show whether this is so.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Various social agencies took steps to help in the emergency and restore
order. The American Red Cross has a branch at Thirty-fifth Street and
Michigan Avenue. As soon as the rioting became serious a special relief
headquarters was established here, and food was distributed to needy families
cut off from work. The Urban League was used as a headquarters for the
distribution of food.
</p>

<p>
The Urban League had for several years, through its employment bureau,
handled a large proportion of the city's Negro labor supply and was conversant
with difficulties likely to result from the rioting. It made food surveys of
the entire Negro area, printed and distributed thousands of circulars and
dodgers urging Negroes to stay off the streets, refrain from dangerous discussions
of the riot, and co-operate with the police in every way to maintain order.
The League sent telegrams to the governor and mayor suggesting plans for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
curbing disorder, organized committees of citizens to aid the authorities in restoring
order, and served as a bureau of information and medium of communication
between the white and Negro groups during the worst hostilities.
</p>

<p>
The Young Men's Christian Association was similarly active within the
area of its efforts. Religious bodies, ministers' associations, and individual
ministers exerted their influence over their respective groups by advising
the citizens to "keep cool," "hold their heads," and generally to let
the authorities settle the riot. Negro business men and one Negro alderman
sent wagons through the streets bearing large signs which advised
Negroes not to congregate on streets, engage in arguments, or participate
in any way in the disorders. The signs further stated that people would
be advised when it would be safe to return to work. Other persons went about
speaking on street corners urging co-operation with the police and militia.
Appeals by officials and leading citizens were published in the white and Negro
papers, carrying similar advice. During the riot a committee of citizens
representing forty-eight social, civic, commercial, and professional organizations
met at the Union League Club and petitioned the governor to take
steps to quiet the existing disorder and appoint a commission to study the
situation with a view to preventing a repetition of it. As a result of this appeal
followed by similar urgings by many committees, the present Chicago Commission
on Race Relations was appointed and began its work.
</p>

<p>
<i>Aftermath of the riot.</i>â€”After the restoration of order community activities
were superficially the same as before the riot, but under the surface there
remained a deepened bitterness of race feeling which spread far beyond the
time and territorial limits of the riot itself.
</p>

<p>
All the deep-seated causes of friction which had developed so largely
from the failure to work out an adjustment of the increased Negro population
due to the migration were and are still present, undiminished in influence.
Consciousness of racial difference and more or less unconscious fear and distrust
were increased and spread by the riot. Among the whites this was evidenced
by the general belief that Negroes were gathering stores of arms and ammunition.
Among the Negroes a growing race solidarity has been marked. There is
a greater lack of confidence in the white man's law and machinery of protection.
Continued bombings of Negro houses in mixed areas and failure to apprehend
the culprits no doubt strengthen this attitude.
</p>

<p>
Reports of various Negro gatherings held soon after the riot show this
to be the case. Many Negroes frankly urged their brothers that they must
arm themselves and fight if attacked. At one meeting a Negro is reported
to have said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The recent race riots have done at least one thing for the colored race. In the
past we Negroes have failed to appreciate what solidarity means. We have, on the
contrary, been much divided. Since the riot we are getting together and devising
ways and means of protecting our interests. The recent race riots have convinced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
us that we must take steps to protect ourselves. Never again will we be found unprepared.
It is the duty of every man here to provide himself with guns and ammunition.
I, myself, have at least one gun and at least enough ammunition to make it useful.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The riot furnished the gang and hoodlum element a chance to indulge in
lawlessness. Fear of death and injury may help to hold that element in check.
But it cannot be argued that fear of punishment is much of a factor, for very
few convictions of rioters were secured.
</p>

<p>
Quick justice would have been a salutary means of curbing tendencies to
riot, according to both the coroner's jury and the grand jury. The coroner's
jury said: "One remedy for race rioting is a speedy conviction and punishment
of those guilty, regardless of race or color, giving all concerned a fair and
impartial hearing." Its eighth recommendation reads: "Above all, a strict
enforcement of the law by public officials, fair and impartial, will do more
than any other agency in restoring the good name of Chicago, and prevent
rioting from any cause from again disturbing the peace of our city."
</p>

<p>
The August, 1919, grand jury said: "This jury feels that in order to allay
further race prejudice and to prevent the re-enactment of shameful crimes
committed during the recent riots, efficient, prompt, and fearless justice on
the part of the judiciary be meted out to the guilty ones, whether they be white
or black."
</p>

<p>
In a fair consideration of whether swift and impartial justice was meted
out, it must be noted that it was extremely hard to secure evidence sufficient
for successful prosecution. Police attention upon arriving at the scene of a
clash was directed more to removing the injured than apprehending the
guilty. Where attempts were made to search out the offenders, it was next
to impossible to get results on account of the keen race consciousness which
made Negroes disclaim knowledge of Negro culprits and white people deny
seeing specific white men act aggressively. Many of the crowds were neighborhood
gatherings and leaders were often the sons of neighbors.
</p>

<p>
In most of the riot cases brought before the state's attorney's office the
same difficulty was experienced. Whole blocks of residents were subpoenaed
and accurately described the assaults, but failed entirely to recognize any of
the assailants. The grand jury found the same obstacle. The foreman,
referring to the kind of testimony brought before that body by Negroes on
complaints against whites, said: "... they [the grand jury] usually found
it to be hearsay testimony. Some other individual told them about So-and-So.
That a crime had been committed there was no question, but to get at the
root of it was absolutely impossible."
</p>

<p>
In spite of these difficulties, those familiar with the riot situation believe
that more arrests of active rioters might have been made and more convictions
obtained. A study of the riot deaths shows that justice failed to be as swift
and sure as the coroner's and grand juries recommended. The blame for
this failure is variously placed on the police, state's attorney, judge, or jury,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
according to the prejudice of the one attempting to fix blame, or his connection
with any of these agencies. The fact remains that the punitive results of the
legal processes were too negligible to furnish a proper deterrent to future
rioters.
</p>

<p>
Of the thirty-eight persons whose death constituted the riot's principal
tollâ€”
</p>

<p>
Fifteen met death at the hands of mobs. The coroners' jury recommended
that the members of the unknown mobs be apprehended. None were ever
found.
</p>

<p>
Six were killed under circumstances establishing no criminal responsibility:
three white men were killed by Negroes in self-defense, and three Negroes
were shot by policemen in the discharge of their duty.
</p>

<p>
Four Negroes lost their lives in the Angelus riot. The coroner made no
recommendations, and the cases were not carried farther.
</p>

<p>
Four casesâ€”two Negro and two whiteâ€”led to recommendations from the
coroner's jury for further investigation of certain persons, but sufficient
evidence was lacking for indictments.
</p>

<p>
Nine cases resulted in indictments, four of which led to convictions.
</p>

<p>
Thus in only four cases was criminal responsibility for death fixed and
punishment meted out to the guilty.
</p>

<p>
Indictments and convictions are divided according to the race of the
persons criminally involved as follows:

<p>
There is evidence that the riot of 1919 aroused many citizens of both races
to a quickened sense of the suffering and disgrace which had come and might
come again to the community, and developed a determination to prevent a
recurrence of so disastrous an outbreak of race hatred. This was manifest,
as another section of this report shows, in the courage and control which people
of both races displayed on at least two occasions in 1920 when confronted
suddenly with events out of which serious riots might easily have grown.

<p>
This examination of the facts of the riot reveals certain outstanding
features, as follows:
</p>

<p>
1. The riot violence was not continuous, hour by hour, but was intermittent.
</p>

<p>
2. The greatest number of injuries occurred in the district west of Wentworth
Avenue, inclusive of Wentworth, and south of the Chicago River to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
Fifty-fifth Street, or, broadly speaking, in the Stock Yards district. The
next greatest number occurred in the so-called "Black Belt," Twenty-second
to Thirty-ninth streets, inclusive, Wentworth to the lake, exclusive of Wentworth;
Thirty-ninth to Fifty-fifth streets, inclusive, Clark Street to Michigan
Avenue, exclusive of Michigan.
</p>

<p>
3. Organized raids occurred only after a period of sporadic clashes and
spontaneous mob outbreaks.
</p>

<p>
4. Main thoroughfares witnessed 76 per cent of the injuries on the South
Side. The streets which suffered most severely were State, Halsted, Thirty-first,
Thirty-fifth, and Forty-seventh. Transfer corners were always centers
of trouble.
</p>

<p>
5. Most of the rioting occurred after working hours. This was particularly
true after the street-car strike started.
</p>

<p>
6. Gangs, particularly among the young whites, formed definite nuclei for
crowd and mob leadership. "Athletic clubs" supplied the leaders of many gangs.
</p>

<p>
7. Whites usually employed fists and clubs in their attacks upon Negroes;
Negroes used firearms and knives in their attacks.
</p>

<p>
8. Crowds and mobs engaged in rioting were usually composed of a small
nucleus of leaders and an acquiescing mass of spectators. The leaders were
young men, usually between sixteen and twenty-one. Dispersal was most
effectively accomplished by sudden, unexpected gun fire.
</p>

<p>
9. Rumor kept the crowds in an excited, potential mob state. The press
was responsible for wide dissemination of much of the inflammatory matter
in spoken rumors, though editorials calculated to allay race hatred and help
the forces of order were factors in the restoration of peace.
</p>

<p>
10. The police lacked sufficient forces for handling the riot; they were
hampered by the Negroes' distrust of them; routing orders and records were
not handled with proper care; certain officers were undoubtedly unsuited to
police or riot duty.
</p>

<p>
11. The personnel of the militia employed in this riot was of an unusually
high type. This unquestionably accounts for the confidence placed in them
by both races. Riot training, definite orders, and good staff work contributed
to their efficiency.
</p>

<p>
12. The machinery of justice was affected by prejudices and political
rivalries.
</p>

<p>
From their reviews of the evidence brought before them, the coroner's
jury and the grand jury presented analyses of the riot, and each made recommendations
of a remedial sort. These recommendations follow:
</p>

<p class="center">
CORONER'S JURY RECOMMENDATIONS
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. We believe that a representative committee of white and colored people,
working together, could suggest and bring about the necessary and advisable changes.
</p>

<p>
2. In specifically attacking the housing situation: The correction of the evil by
enlarging the living quarters and placing them in a better sanitary state would in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
part solve the difficulty. We believe voluntary segregation would follow and to a
considerable extent remove one cause of unrest.
</p>

<p>
This is a matter that might well be considered by the Real Estate Board and by
improvement clubs and organizations of property owners in the South Division, and
by the Health Department.
</p>

<p>
3. In regard to the "athletic clubs": Properly governed and controlled they
should be encouraged and fostered and, when necessary, disciplined.
</p>

<p>
4. Hoodlumism evokes this comment: Citizens of Chicago, make your hoodlum
element amenable to law, break up and destroy hoodlumism as you would a pestilence.
It is our belief that this element can be brought under control of the law, and it must
be done if we are to remove the danger of rioting from any cause. Vicious hoodlumism,
entirely aside from race hatred, was present in practically all of the thirty-eight
killings, known as race riots.
</p>

<p>
5. We earnestly urge that fathers and mothers teach their children the lesson
of remaining at home when rioting occurs, and furthermore, they should be kept
occupied, as idleness and bad association often cause young people to become bad
men and women.
</p>

<p>
6. One remedy for race rioting is a speedy conviction and punishment of those
guilty, regardless of race or color, giving all concerned a fair and impartial hearing.
</p>

<p>
7. Tolerance must be practiced between both white and colored in the discussion
of the race problem, practiced in our everyday intercourse, in public conveyances,
and in meetings of all kinds.
</p>

<p>
8. Our attention was called strikingly to the fact that at the time of race rioting
the arrests made for rioting by the police of colored rioters were far in excess of the
arrests made of white rioters. The failure of the police to arrest impartially at the
time of rioting, whether from insufficient effort or otherwise, was a mistake and had a
tendency to further incite and aggravate the colored population.
</p>

<p>
9. In cases of murder it is of the utmost importance that expert criminologists
should arrive on the scene at the earliest possible moment, and that a complete examination
may be made of the scene of the murder before the body is removed or handled,
and while the necessary evidence for conviction may be obtained, which otherwise
may be lost or destroyed. We have found in the riot cases many instances where the
removal of bodies by inexperienced men, in some cases police officers, destroyed
valuable evidence.
</p>

<p>
We heartily concur with Coroner Hoffman as to the fact that Chicago badly needs
a permanent murder-investigation squad, which the coroner planned and has so
persistently advocated in the past. We believe that this squad should be equipped
with motor vehicles and subject to call at any hour of the day or night. This squad
should consist of six or more trained policemen, working in relays of eight hours, a
photographer, a finger-print expert, a coroner's physician and chemist, the coroner or
deputy coroner, and a state's attorney. In addition thereto, two trained policemen
from the police department precinct wherein the murder occurred, and a representative
of the City News Bureau. This squad should be available for immediate service, and
it should be the duty of the police at the scene of the murder to allow no one to handle
the body or enter premises where murder occurred until the arrival of the squad.
</p>

<p>
10. The police force should be enlarged. It is too small to cope with the needs
of Chicago, and under the present living conditions the policeman's pay is entirely
inadequate and should be substantially increased.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Superannuated and incapacitated members of the police force should be retired
under a proper and satisfactory pension system.
</p>

<p>
There should be organization of the force for riot work, for the purpose of controlling
rioting in its incipient stages.
</p>
</div>

<p class="center">
GRAND JURY RECOMMENDATIONS
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. It is reasonable to believe that the colored people, if provided with proper
housing facilities and an area sufficient in extent, would voluntarily segregate themselves.
The present neighborhood known as the "Black Belt" could, by reasonable
public improvement, assisted by our leading public citizens, be made a decent place
to live in for a much larger population than it now accommodates.... This movement
should enlist the financial and moral support of the industries employing large
numbers of the black race.
</p>

<p>
2. Facilities for bathing, playgrounds, police protection, better housing and
neighborhood conditions, are matters deserving the earnest attention of the proper
authorities.
</p>

<p>
3. The employment of the colored people is imperative to the welfare of this community.
Discriminating against the Negro, or, in other words, failure to give him an
opportunity to make an honest livelihood after having induced him to migrate to
this section of the country, simply adds to the already far too great number of hoodlums
that infest our city.
</p>

<p>
4. This jury feels that in order to allay further race prejudice and to prevent
the re-enactment of shameful crimes committed during the recent riots, efficient,
prompt, and fearless justice on the part of the law-enforcing officers, as well as on
the part of the judiciary, be meted out to the guilty ones, whether they be white or
black.
</p>

<p>
5. ... There is a lack of co-operation and harmony among the agencies of law
enforcement, which impairs their efficiency, leads to miscarriages of justice, and wastes
the public funds.
</p>

<p>
6. The parole law should be amended so that a criminal once paroled and subsequently
arrested may not a second time be paroled.
</p>

<p>
7. The efficiency of the police force would be further greatly increased by the
co-operation of the judiciary in refusing to grant wholesale continuances without
carefully scrutinizing the results thereof when members of the police force are required
to act as witnesses.
</p>

<p>
8. The police department is in need of a thorough house-cleaning. Every officer,
no matter what his position is, who fails in his full duty should be dismissed. Grafters
and those who allow themselves to be dominated by political influences, who are
paid to protect the lives and property of our citizens, should be dismissed and punished
to the fullest extent of the law.
</p>

<p>
9. It is the opinion of this jury that the police force is also inadequate in numbers,
and at least one thousand (1,000) officers should be added to the existing force.
</p>

<p>
10. Policemen who have arrived at the age where their usefulness is a matter
of the past should be pensioned, notwithstanding their present number, and notwithstanding
the fact that the pension fund is already taxed to its utmost. The
needed funds for this purpose should be provided.
</p>

<p>
11. ... payment of salaries to public officers commensurate with the increased
cost of living.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
</p>

<p>
12. The authorities employed to enforce the law should thoroughly investigate
clubs and other organizations posing as athletic and social clubs which really are
organizations of hoodlums and criminals formed for the purpose of furthering the
interest of local politics.
</p>

<p>
13. The jury also finds that vice of all kinds is rampant in the "Black Belt," and
a thorough cleaning up of that district is absolutely essential to the peace and welfare
of the community.
</p>

<p>
14. Political influence to a large extent is responsible for the brazenness with
which the Chicago bum, pickpocket, and gun and hold-up man operates. It is also
the opinion of the jury that the indeterminate-sentence law frequently operates in a
miscarriage of justice, and it is our opinion that the court should fix the sentence of
offenders at the time of their conviction.
</p>

<p>
15. Because of the large number of young boys involved in the rioting, the jury
recommends the resumption of the activities of the Y.M.C.A., the Knights of Columbus,
and Salvation Army, as well as other similar organizations....

CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
<span class="s08">OTHER OUTBREAKS IN ILLINOIS</span>
</h2>

<h3>
I. <span class="smcap">Minor Clashes in and near Chicago</span>
</h3>

<h4>
1. CLASHES IN CHICAGO PRECEDING THE RIOT OF 1919
</h4>

<p>
The race riot of 1919 in Chicago was preceded by a long series of more
or less serious clashes between whites and Negroes. Some of these are discussed
in the section of this report dealing with contacts in recreation. Others are
here described to show the development of friction and conflict leading up to
the 1919 riot. Two brutal and unprovoked murders of Negroes by gangs
of white hoodlums preceded the riot by only a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
In many of the antecedent clashes a conspicuous part was played by gangs
or clubs of white boys and young men. These operations frequently showed
organization, and the gangsters were often armed with brass knuckles, clubs,
and revolvers.
</p>

<p>
Some of the earlier clashes, however, did not have their origin in gang
activities. For instance, it may be that the resentment by whites of the
coming of Negroes into their neighborhood inspired the crowd of boys between
twelve and sixteen years of age who, in February, 1917, stoned a four-flat
building at 456 West Forty-sixth Street. Two Negro families moved into
the two second-floor flats of this building. The next afternoon about 100
boys from nearby schools stoned the building. The two Negroes attempted
to remonstrate but were driven back. One of them reached the office of the
agent of the building, who notified the police. A patrol wagon responded,
but the boys had disappeared. After it had gone the boys reappeared and
renewed the stoning. Every window in the upper part of the building was
broken. On a second riot call Captain Caughlin and Lieutenant James
McGann and a squad of police rescued the Negroes, who shortly afterward
sought other quarters.
</p>

<p>
Detectives learned the identity of thirty of the boys, some of whom confessed.
With their parents they were compelled to appear at the Stock
Yards police station and pay for the damage inflicted.
</p>

<p>
The death of a white man, wrongly thought to have been murdered by
Negroes, led to rioting on the night of July 3, 1917, in which a party of white
men in an automobile fired upon a group of Negroes at Fifty-third and Federal
streets. Apparently no one was hit. Earlier in the evening Charles A.
Maronde, a saloon-keeper at 5161 South State Street, had been found dead
following an altercation with Negroes whose passage through his premises
had irritated him. Two shots were fired, but it was not proved whether by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
Maronde or by the Negroes. A coroner's jury found that he had died of
heart disease.
</p>

<p>
In July and August, 1917, there were minor outbreaks of trouble between
Negroes and naval recruits from the Great Lakes Naval Training Station.
In some instances recruits and in others Negroes were reported to be the
aggressors.
</p>

<p>
When organized gangs took part in clashes the results were more serious.
A typical case started in the Kohler saloon at South State and Fifty-first
streets on May 27, 1919, two months before the riot.
</p>

<p>
A group of about ten white men entered the saloon together. When a
Negro came in and called for a drink, one of the whites knocked him down and
kicked him out of the front door. Arming himself with brickbats, the Negro
called on the whites to come out. The gang crossed to another saloon on the
opposite corner, and when they left it shortly afterward, they carried revolvers.
They then beat the Negro, cutting his head. Dr. Homer Cooper, whose
office is above the Kohler saloon, and one of his patients, Michael Pantaliono,
witnessed the affray.
</p>

<p>
Roscoe C. Johnston, a Negro plain-clothes man who had been on the
police force only four days, was told of the trouble by a citizen and found the
gang in the second saloon. As he approached, Mart. Flannigan drew a revolver.
Johnston called two plain-clothes men, who chanced to be outside, to summon
a patrol wagon, then followed the gang back to the Kohler saloon and disarmed
and arrested Flannigan. Johnston found three automatic revolvers behind
the bar in the saloon and arrested three more of the men for carrying concealed
weapons. Later six more of the men were taken when the patrol wagon
returned to Kohler's, including Patten, the bartender.
</p>

<p>
The cases of these ten men were dismissed when they came to trial a week
later before Judge Grant; lack of evidence was the reason given. Flannigan
explained that he carried the gun to protect himself while taking money to
the bank. These young men were said by onlookers to be members of "Ragen's
Colts."
</p>

<p>
"Ragen's Colts" were frequently identified with lawlessness and specific
clashes before and during the riot. They are typical of the gangs and "athletic
clubs" which were responsible for much disorder, including attacks upon
Negroes. This organization was sponsored by Frank Ragen, a politician whose
record and methods have long offended the decent citizenship of Chicago.
As a member of the Board of Cook County Commissioners, he allied himself
with a spoils-seeking majority against which two or three public-spirited
members waged a courageous struggle. His participation in the Board's
deliberations was marked by such conduct as the hurling of a large record
book and inkwells at members who opposed the "ring."
</p>

<p>
As part of his political following he gathered about him the young hoodlums
who make up an important element of the club on which he bestowed his name.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
Ragen's influence has often been able to protect the "Colts" from punishment
for criminal acts, including the persecution of Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Other "athletic" and "social" clubs, though not so notorious, have been
of a like nature. Miss Mary McDowell, head resident of the University of
Chicago Social Settlement, told the Commission that she knew of five such
clubs composed of young men between seventeen and twenty-two:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Especially before the war they were always under obligation to some politician
for renting a store and paying the initial expenses of their clubs. That's what started
them, and it has come to be quite the fashion to get an empty store with big panes of
glass on which they like to put their names. I am speaking now of "back of the Yards"
conditions.
</p>

<p>
The Ragen Club is mostly Irish-American. The others are from the second
generation of many nationalities. I don't think they have deliberate criminal desires.
I think they get into these ways, and then they are used and exploited often by politicians....
It is about the most dangerous thing that we have in the city. Whether
the police could not stop them at the time of the riot on the Monday when they went
down Forty-seventh Street with firearms showing in their hands in autos (a young
man living with us can give you his affidavit on it) and shouting as they went, "We'll
get those niggers!" I don't suppose anybody would want to say, but the fact remains
that nobody did stop them. They went across Halsted Street towards State Street.
Four policemen were there and they never stopped them at all.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Miss Jane Addams, of Hull-House, also described to the Commission the
way in which the ward politicians are responsible for these clubs. She said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The politicians have had a new trick the last few years all over the city. They
pay rent, as Miss McDowell said, for clubs of boys below the voting age. The politician
used to take care of the young voter and the boy nearly a voter, but now he comes
down to boys of thirteen and fourteen and fifteen and begins to pay their rent and
give them special privileges and keeps the police off when they are gambling. The
whole boy problem is very much more mixed up with theseâ€”I won't call them gangs,
but they are clubs with more or less political affiliations. They are not always loyal
to their political boss, but he expects them to be and they are, more or less.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The gangs and "athletic clubs" became more boldly active in the spring
of 1919. On the night of June 21, five weeks before the riot, there were two
wanton murders of Negroes by gangs of white hoodlums. One of the Negroes
was Sanford Harris, the other Joseph Robinson. There is no evidence that
either had been offensive in any way, yet they were deliberately killed by gangs.
There is evidence that the gangs in the neighborhoods of these crimes had
spread such fear among Negro residents that murders of this kind were not
unexpected.
</p>

<p>
Harris lived on Dearborn Street between Fifty-sixth and Fifty-seventh
streets. About 11:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on June 21 he escorted from his home to a street
car at State and Fifty-seventh streets a woman friend who had been calling on
his wife. A Negro man, woman, and child alighted from this car, and Harris
walked behind them west on Fifty-seventh Street on his way home. A number
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
of white youths approached the man, woman, and child, one of the gang saying,
"Let's get that nigger," referring to the man. Because of the child's presence
they were allowed to pass unmolested.
</p>

<p>
Then the gang caught sight of Harris, who started to run across a vacant lot
toward his home. A shot was fired and Harris fell after going a short distance.
He died at the Cook County Hospital from peritonitis due to the bullet wound.
</p>

<p>
A woman living near Fifty-seventh and Dearborn streets caught hold of
one of the gang who had a pistol in his hand. A plain-clothes policeman
appeared, and she called upon him to arrest the gangster who, she said, had
shot Harris. The detective merely asked how she was able to pick out the
man who had fired the shot. Apparently he ignored the fact that the man
held a revolver in his hand, nor does it appear that he even looked to see whether
it had been recently discharged.
</p>

<p>
A Mrs. Tâ€”â€”, who lived above the saloon at the northwest corner of State
and Fifty-seventh streets, had witnessed the assault on Harris from her back
porch. When other plain-clothes men came upon the scene, she told them
that the gang had hidden under the viaduct on Fifty-seventh Street west of
Dearborn, but there were no arrests and apparently no attempts to make any.
</p>

<p>
Earlier the same evening, an altercation had taken place between a number
of white boys from sixteen to twenty years of age and Thomas Johnson,
a Negro who, with a Mrs. Moss, conducted a store next to a saloon at
State and Fifty-seventh streets. The boys had been loafing outside the
door and using foul language. Johnson remonstrated with them and finally
got a stick and started after them. A number of other Negroes aided in
driving off the boys, who, as they left, threatened to "get a gang and come
back and get you." It is thought that this was the gang that killed Harris.
</p>

<p>
Joseph Robinson, the other Negro killed that same night, had lived at
514 West Fifty-fourth Place. He was forty-seven years of age, a laborer for
the Union Coal Company, and had a wife and six children, the oldest seventeen
years of age. He was attacked by a gang at Fifty-fifth Street and Princeton
Avenue, apparently without provocation, and received knife wounds in the
back and left leg. He died from shock and hemorrhages on June 23.
</p>

<p>
A man named Morden, who lived at 5713 Drexel Avenue, testified at the
Robinson inquest that he had met a gang of from fifteen to thirty men at Fifty-fifth
Street and Shields Avenue about a block from Princeton Avenue. He said
the gang was walking rapidly east and divided to pass him. He was not far
away when Robinson was attacked. The Negro had evidently been coming
in the opposite direction, west on Fifty-fifth Street (Garfield Boulevard) and
the assault began the instant he met the gang. Morden heard a shot fired
and saw Robinson stagger across the street to a candy store. He saw several
men rush forward and help Robinson in the door as the gang scattered. Morden
declared that several of the gang carried clubs, and that he saw several of these
during the assault.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Nicholas Gianakas, who conducted the candy store at 5458 Princeton
Avenue, into which the wounded man had run, testified that he heard the shot
and saw people outside running in all directions. He saw Robinson coming
in the door with blood running off him. Presently Robinson got up and went
outside to sit on the curb. Gianakas called up the police station for an ambulance.
He saw no weapons in the hands of any of the crowd outside and
recognized none of them. He heard people saying that a mob had come from
"the Yards."
</p>

<p>
Peter Paul Byrne, a patrolman, testified that he had been called from his
beat at Fifty-fifth and State streets by a man in an automobile, who drove him
to the candy store. There he also telephoned for an ambulance, then went
out and rounded up "some kids" on suspicion. There was a big crowd
around, he said, men, women, and children.
</p>

<p>
One man testified at the inquest that an acquaintance spoke of having
seen a Greek run out of the candy store and hit Robinson on the head with a
hammer or hatchet. But this acquaintance, when called to testify, denied
the story.
</p>

<p>
Captain Caughlin, in charge of the police of that precinct, testified that a
number of men had been arrested on suspicion, but all of them had been
discharged because none of them knew anything about the matter. People
had been running in every direction, he said, there had been a good deal of
commotion, and he seemed to think it would have been virtually impossible
for the police to find any of the guilty persons.
</p>

<p>
C. L. McCutcheon, a Negro railway postal clerk, living at 517 West
Fifty-fourth Place, testified at the inquest that he had been threatened by
mobs, that a gang over on the boulevard had so terrorized the fifteen or twenty
"colored boys" in the neighborhood for a long time that none of them dared
to go about alone; that he himself had two boys who would not go on Halsted
Street for $10 a trip.
</p>

<p>
Following the killing of Harris and Robinson notices were posted along
Garfield Boulevard and some neighboring streets saying that the authors of
the notices would "get" all the "niggers" on July 4, 1919. These notices
also called for help from sympathizers. They predicted that there would be
a street-car strike on the appointed day, and that then they expected to run
all Negroes out of the district. Some witnesses at the inquest stated that
the Negroes of the district, who up to that time had done nothing to protect
themselves, were advised by friendly whites to "prepare for the worst," as
trouble could scarcely be avoided.
</p>

<h4>
2. RACIAL OUTBREAK IN WAUKEGAN
<br />
May 31 and June 2, 1920
</h4>

<p>
Waukegan, Illinois, thirty-six miles north of Chicago and near the Great
Lakes Naval Training Station of the United States Navy, was the scene of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
two riotous attacks during the nights of May 31 and June 2, 1920, on a lodging-house
for Negroes, by bands of recruits on leave from the Naval Training
Station. No lives were lost, and only two persons were hurt, neither of them
seriously.
</p>

<p>
These outbursts scarcely classify as race riots. The chief motive seems to
have been a desire for excitement on the part of young and active naval recruits.
</p>

<p>
The Sherman House was a dilapidated place on Genesee Street, the main
street of the town. It had been abandoned by whites and was run as a lodging-house
for thirty or thirty-five unmarried Negroes, chiefly factory workers.
On the first floor was a poolroom and soft-drink "parlor," which some of the
naval recruits had patronized.
</p>

<p>
A mischievous Negro boy of ten years, George Taylor, was primarily responsible
for the outbreaks. On the afternoon of May 31 he and his little sister had
been throwing stones at passing automobiles in Sheridan Road. One of these
missiles broke the wind shield of an automobile driven by Lieutenant A. F.
Blazier, an officer at the Great Lakes Station, who allowed this fact to become
known to some of the recruits at the station. Late that evening an unorganized
mob of recruits assembled at the Sherman House and threw stones, breaking
nearly all the windows. The mob was rushed by all the available police in
Waukegan, who took six prisoners. One reported incident was the chasing of
a Negro by half a dozen bluejackets and marines and his rescue by the police.
</p>

<p>
Provost guards from the Naval Station rounded up the rioters and took
them back to Great Lakes, thus ending the outbreak.
</p>

<p>
Two nights later, or June 2, 150 boys on leave from the Naval Training
Station renewed the attack. They gathered in a ravine near the hotel and
at ten o'clock they poured forth, led by a sailor carrying an American flag.
The police had been warned and were ready with reinforcements.
</p>

<p>
About seventy-five feet from the lodging-house the police ordered the
attackers to halt; no attention was paid to the command, and they fired
their riot guns in the air, wounding two marines who were some distance
away. Hand-to-hand fighting ensued, during which the police seized the
flag and arrested two marines. The Great Lakes boys gathered about the
police station and demanded their comrades.
</p>

<p>
Commander M. M. Frucht, executive officer of the Naval Station, who
had already been sent to Waukegan by Commandant Bassett, appeared at
the door and quieted the crowd with a promise that all concerned would have
a square deal. He also advised them to return at once to the Naval Station.
</p>

<p>
The police released the two prisoners and gave back the flag. Two hundred
provost guards from the Naval Station arrived in motor trucks while the crowd
was at the police station.
</p>

<p>
Waukegan youths, evidently banded together for the purpose, searched
the house of Edward Dorsey, Negro, at 905 Market Street, on the night of
June 5. Ten of them, ranging from seventeen to twenty-two years, were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
arrested. They said they had heard that five white persons were held prisoners
in Dorsey's home and that it was their intention to effect a rescue. It was
asserted that a number of provost guards accompanied the crowd to the
Dorsey house.
</p>

<p>
The general spirit of the people of Waukegan regarding Negroes may be
judged from a proclamation by Mayor J. F. Bidinger, in which he disclaimed
for the people of the city any intention to harass the Negro. Referring to
reports that some of the white people of the town had participated in the
disturbances, the mayor said: "In the first they did not, and in the second
in no great numbers. Hoodlums generally run true to form and seldom
overlook ready-made opportunity to manifest their peculiar taste in deviltry.
Hence the mixing of a few of them into these fracases signifies nothing in so
far as our general public is concerned."
</p>

<p>
Observers agreed with the mayor that the disturbances were not race
riots. In this connection his proclamation said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Now it is a definitely ascertained fact that no adult Negro was even remotely
connected with the first stone-throwing; that the colored people did not then retaliate
and have not since sought to retaliate in even the smallest measure; and that all
the episodes have consisted simply of an attack upon people who have been as inoffensive
throughout the entire affair as they could well be. All of which I submit
stamps this affair as an example of disorderly conduct indeed, but not as a race riot.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
3. THE "ABYSSINIAN" AFFAIR
</h4>

<p>
Sunday afternoon, June 20, 1920, a small group of Negroes styling themselves
"Abyssinians" ended a parade of their "order" in front of a cafÃ© at
209 East Thirty-fifth Street frequented by both whites and Negroes. After
a brief ceremony one of the leaders produced an American flag and deliberately
burned it. He then began to destroy a second flag in the same manner.
Two white policemen remonstrated with the men but were intimidated by
threats and a brandishing of revolvers. They left immediately to notify
police headquarters. Patrolman Owens, Negro, arrived as a second flag was
lighted. Rushing up to the leader who held the burning flag in his hands
and remonstrating with the group for their disloyalty, he was immediately
shot and wounded. Robert Lawson Rose, a sailor on leave from the Great
Lakes Naval Training Station, protested against the destruction of the flag
and he too was shot; he staggered into the doorway of a cigar store at
207 East Thirty-fifth Street. Some of the parade leaders got rifles from a
closed automobile which had followed the parade and was standing near by,
and fired into the cigar store. One of these bullets killed Joseph Hoyt, a clerk
in the store. The sailor, Rose, also died from his wound. In all about twenty-five
shots were fired during the fracas, and several persons were injured.
</p>

<p>
The men who did the shooting escaped but were arrested later. Crowds
attracted by the demonstration quickly dispersed when the shooting began,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
and from then on there was virtually no disorder except for attacks at a railroad
station on three Negro ministers who were returning to the city and knew
nothing of the shooting. Nine Negroes were arrested and held to the grand
jury. One of them was Grover Cleveland Redding, thirty-seven or thirty-eight
years of age, who was the "prophet" of the "Abyssinian" order in
Chicago. Redding, who had admitted the shooting of Rose, was held with
Oscar McGavick for murder, and the others as accessories after the fact.<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a>
</p>

<p>
The exact reason for this flag-burning has not been disclosed, although
it was apparently intended to symbolize the feeling of the "Abyssinian"
followers that it was time to forswear allegiance to the American government
and consider themselves under allegiance to the Abyssinian government.
</p>

<p>
The guns used in the shooting were found by the police in a garage, together
with the regalia of the "Abyssinians," and much of their printed matter and
other effects.<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a>
</p>

<p>
The "Abyssinian" affair might easily have been turned into another
great outbreak such as that of July, 1919. But the police, profiting by their
experience of the previous year, were vigilant. They had organized an emergency
force which was quickly mobilized and put in service in the district.
Moreover, there was evident such a feeling of restraint on the part of both
whites and Negroes that they combined to hunt down the offenders.
</p>

<p>
Indicative of this spirit of co-operation to prevent racial conflict, and helpful
to it, was the careful handling of the matter by the press. Practically every
newspaper gave prominence to the way in which the two races worked together
to this end, and all dwelt on the courageous action of the Negro policeman.
A picture printed in the <i>Herald-Examiner</i> the following morning showed
people of the two races fraternizing after the shooting. The <i>Daily News</i> in
reporting the affray said that only the co-operation of the white and Negro
merchants of the district stopped the disturbance; that rowdies in the neighborhood
were ready for a fight, but that "the better class of whites and Negroes
worked directly with the police to stop any such trouble as a recurrence of
the rioting last summer, which occurred in the same neighborhood."
</p>

<p>
To understand the "Abyssinian" affair an acquaintance with other
characters, certain group propaganda and movements, is necessary. The
"Back to Africa" movement, which lent fervor and enthusiasm to the development
of lawlessness and wanton killing by this group of unlettered Negroes,
has been in progress for more than two years. The Black Star Steamship
Line and the Universal Improvement Association, headed by a Negro, Marcus
Garvey, a British subject, were organized to establish commercial relations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
with Africa. To arouse interest and secure funds for the enterprise, sentiment
has been created among Negroes for the developing of sections of Africa where
they may govern themselves and build up their own institutions and commerce.
The movement has gained thousands of adherents; although the language of
its appeals has frequently been extreme, it has engaged in no dangerous or
unpatriotic activities. Its connection with the tragic incident lies in the
implication that "Back to Africa" means away from the land of unfair treatment,
and thus suggests contempt for the United States.

<p class="caption">PROPAGANDA LITERATURE USED BY "ABYSSINIANS" IN RECRUITING
FOLLOWERS</p>
</div>

<p>
The "Star Order of Ethiopia and Ethiopian Missionaries to Abyssinia"
appears to be an illegitimate offspring of the Universal Improvement Association
and the Black Star Steamship Line. The visit of the Abyssinian Mission
to this country a year ago to renew a treaty between their country and the
United States probably served as an added suggestion. The leaders of the
movement were Redding, secretary of the order; Joseph Fernon, called
the "Great Abyssinian," and his son, "The Prince." Together with a "Dr."
R. D. Jonas, a white man who for several years has engaged in sundry activities
among Negroes, they organized this movement among a class of Negroes too
ignorant to exercise restraint over their racial resentments.
</p>

<p>
Emotionalism was aroused and a semi-religious twist was given through
their appeals, which played more or less injudiciously on the desire of Negroes
to improve their economic status and to escape from what some of them
regard as oppression, either in this or in other countries. One or two other
similar organizations are making such an appeal, not only to Negroes in this
country, but to other dark-skinned races throughout the world. It is sought
to weld them all together into a great nation. Glittering promises are set
before the illiterate element of the Negro race, which has responded sufficiently
to fatten the purses of some, at least, of the "prophets."
</p>

<p>
Redding was one of these "prophets." He was influenced by the white
man, "Dr." R. D. Jonas, and had purchased from him the robe or toga
which he wore during the parade of June 20. According to those who knew
both men, he had first "stolen Jonas' thunder" and the following out of which
the "Star Order of Ethiopia" had been manufactured. Having lost this,
Jonas was willing to sell the regalia.
</p>

<p>
Jonas, it appears, had been promoting one movement after another among
illiterate Negroes for six or seven years. At one time he conducted a
co-operative store on State Street, in which he sold shares. He was often
an orator at street gatherings and had been arrested a number of times. When
Alexander Dowie of Zion City died, Jonas is said to have attempted to put
himself into the vacant position. After the East St. Louis riots he appeared
in Chicago in an express wagon with signs indicating that he was collecting
funds for the Negroes of East St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon of the shooting, Jonas had been the principal speaker
at a small, orderly meeting of Negroes in Johnson's Hall, 3516 South State
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
Street, at which he had launched a campaign for Mayor Thompson as a
third-party candidate for president of the United States. The Mayor, he
said, was the only man who could be trusted "to carry out Roosevelt's work"
and put through the treaty with Abyssinia which expired in 1917. He also
referred to the efforts of the Jews to return to Palestine and of the Irish to
free themselves from British domination, and suggested the desirability of a
coalition of the Negro, Jewish, and Irish races. Redding's hold on many of
the Negroes was partly due to the fact that he is a Negro and claims to be a
native of Abyssinia, whereas Jonas is a white man.
</p>

<p>
Quite evidently the "Back to Abyssinia" movement was used as a means
for exploiting credulous Negroes. For one dollar they could purchase an
Abyssinian flag, a small pamphlet containing a prophecy relating to the return
of the black-skinned people to Africa, a copy of a so-called treaty between the
United States and Abyssinia, and a picture of the "Prince of the Abyssinians."
Likewise when the propaganda had begun to take root, one might sign a blank
form which would commit him to return to "my motherland of Ethiopia" in
order that he might fill any one of forty-four positions, such as electrical engineer,
mechanical draftsman, civil engineer, architect, chemist, sign-painter, cartoonist,
illustrator, traffic manager, teacher, auto-repairing, agriculture, and
poultry-raising. The blank itself was headed:

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
qualified to fill. Blank space appears then for name, address, present occupation,
city, state, and county. At the bottom appears the name of George
Gabriel, described as "Abyssinian" linguist and native of Abyssinia, together
with that of Grover C. Redding, secretary and missionary. The applicant
is requested to mail the blank to 1812 Thirteenth Street, Washington, D.C.,
in care of Mrs. Dabney, or 115 W. 138th Street, New York City, care of Charles
Manson, or Joseph Goldberg, Jaffa, Palestine.
</p>

<p>
The immediate inspiration of the Abyssinians, as previously suggested,
was a visit to this country, more than a year before, of a delegation from
Abyssinia, which had concerned itself with a renewal of the old treaty. It is
pointed out that the chief reason why Negroes should be interested in this
treaty is that they might use it to overthrow "Jim Crow" laws in certain
states. Under this treaty Abyssinians had been guaranteed the right to
travel at will in the United States under the protection of the federal government.
Men like Redding had evidently interpreted this to mean that under
such a treaty the United States would be bound to interfere in behalf of Abyssinians,
if they should be discriminated against under a "Jim Crow" law.
</p>

<p>
Redding, however, had some sort of biblical interpretation for his movement.
He maintained that his mission was indicated in the Bible. He
quoted from the Scriptures these words: "So shall the King of Assyria lead
away the Egyptian prisoners, the Ethiopian captives, young and old, to the
shame of Egypt." Asserting that the Ethiopians do not belong here, and that
they should be taken back to their own country, he construed a biblical passage
as meaning that the time of their bondage in a foreign country should be the
expiration of a 300-year period. This period, he said, began in 1619, when
Negroes were first taken for purposes of slavery from Africa to America. He
said that the burning of the flag was the symbol indicated to him through these
biblical passages, and the sign that Abyssinians should no longer stay in this
country.
</p>

<p>
As to the flag of Abyssinia, he had interpreted it thus: "The red means
the blood of Christ; the green, the grass on which he knelt for you and me;
the yellow for the clay. The Ethiopian flag is better known as 'Calvary's
flag.'"
</p>

<p>
Jonas, from whom Redding had obtained these ideas of a Negro Utopia
in Africa, claimed that he had introduced to President Wilson the Abyssinian
delegation which had come to this country. He claimed the credit for having
taken Redding into his home and cared for him several years ago at the behest
of Mrs. Jonas, who had told him that he was a "smart young fellow."
</p>

<p>
The ceremonies and manifestations of the "Abyssinians" were marked by
such fanaticism that responsible Negroes repudiated them and condemned
the leaders along with other criminals and exploiters of the ignorant Negroes.
The <i>Negro World</i>, organ of the Universal Improvement Association and Black
Star Line, carried the following article.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Appalled by the violence aroused on Sunday night, when an American flag was
burned and two men were killed by the Abyssinian zealots, colored leaders of the
Middle West have begun a systematic campaign to eliminate white exploitation among
the Negroes and to bring about better racial co-operation.
</p>

<p>
The Chicago police announced today that all the men wanted in the case, except
two, are under arrest. They also promised that the career of Grover Cleveland
Redding, self-styled "Prince of Abyssinia," and identified as a ringleader in the
affair, will enter a new phase tomorrow when the frock-coated suspect is formally
charged with murder, accessory to murder and rioting.
</p>

<p>
Oscar McGavick, one of the men sought, was arrested in Pittsburgh today.
"Bill" Briggs and Frank Heans were taken into custody here. This leaves the police
list with only two names, the Fernons, father and son. "Dr." R. D. Jonas, known on
the South Side as a professional agitator, was released today, no evidence having been
found of his direct connection with the shooting. Federal officials are investigating him.
</p>

<p>
According to the opinions of some of the leaders among Chicago Negroes the
"Abyssinian movement," from which Sunday night's trouble indirectly resulted, is a
legitimate and valid enterprise. It is but one of the manifestations of that bubbling
activity which today characterizes the colored people of America in their struggle for
race progression.
</p>

<p>
The trouble lies, they claim, in a group of exploiters and mountebanks, who,
unauthorized by real leaders in the movement, have seized upon it as a medium for personal
gain. In Chicago two of these were Jonas and Redding, it is claimed.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Pertinent on this point also is the stand taken by the <i>Chicago Defender</i>,
among the most influential of the Negro publications, concerning the Abyssinians,
which said editorially:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We warn all agitators, whether they be white or black, that this paper, standing as
it does for law and order, for justice to all men, for that brotherhood without which no
country can long prosper, and for the better element of our twelve millions, that we
condemn their disloyalty and will do all in our power to aid the constituted authorities
in crushing them.
</p>

<p>
The burning of the American flag by a group of self-styled Abyssinians at 35th St.
and Indiana Avenue last Sunday evening, as a means of showing their contempt
for the United States, and the resultant murders that followed in the wake of this
demonstration, instead of accomplishing the end desired by these malcontents, acted
as a boomerang. Every black face portrayed indignation. Every black arm was
lifted to strike a blow at these law-breakers. This is our home, our country, our flag,
for whose honor and protection we will give our last drop of blood. With all our
shortcomings it can never truthfully be said that we are disloyal or unpatriotic.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The real problem indicated by the "Abyssinian" affair is how to prevent
self-seekers from playing upon the superstitions and emotions of ignorant
Negroes, to the harm of others and the disturbance of the peace.
</p>

<h4>
4. THE BARRETT MURDER
</h4>

<p>
The murder of a white man, Thomas J. Barrett, by a Negro on September
20, 1920, is not particularly significant in itself. But it was committed in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
the heart of the district where some of the worst rioting took place in 1919,
it created a situation which might easily have developed into another serious
riot, and it affords an example of prompt and effective police handling.
</p>

<p class="caption">AFTER THE "ABYSSINIAN MURDERS"<br />
<span class="s08">Photograph taken at Thirty-fifth Street and Indiana Avenue, where both races co-operated to maintain order.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Forty-seventh and Halsted streets is the intersection of two main thoroughfares
used by Negroes returning home from work in the Stock Yards. The
neighborhood is one where gangs of hoodlums have attacked Negroes, and is
thickly settled with people who have shown considerable antagonism toward
Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Barrett, who was a motorman on the Chicago surface lines, was killed
shortly after seven o'clock in the evening. He had had his shoes shined at
the stand of William Sianis, 4720 South Halsted Street, and had purchased
a newspaper at Halsted and Forty-seventh streets at about 7:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> About
the same time three Negroes came out of the yards of Ready &amp; Callaghan
on Halsted Street between Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh, and one of these
Negroes went to the news stand seeking a newspaper in which to roll up his
overalls. In an encounter with these Negroes, Barrett was fatally stabbed,
dying before he reached a hospital. His head was nearly severed from his
body.
</p>

<p>
The Negroes, pursued by a rapidly increasing crowd of whites, ran north
nearly a block on Halsted Street. They turned into a vacant lot and went
through alleys until they emerged on Forty-fifth Street near Emerald Avenue,
evidently trying to work their way east to the main Negro neighborhood.
The crowd, however, had thickened so rapidly that they took refuge in St.
Gabriel's Catholic Church, just east of Lowe Avenue.
</p>

<p>
The mob was checked by the appearance and quieting remarks of Father
Thomas M. Burke, pastor of the church. He told them that the Negroes had
sought sanctuary, that there were laws to punish them, and that it was not
the province of a mob to wreak summary vengeance.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the police were already arriving. A patrol wagon had left
the Stock Yards station about seven o'clock, and followed the pursuing crowd.
Acting Lieutenant Bullard telephoned at once to Chief Garrity, and extra
police were quickly thrown into the neighborhood to control the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Samuel C. Rank, lieutenant of police at the Thirteenth Precinct station,
Forty-seventh Place and Halsted Street, had received the alarm about seven
o'clock. He sent five detectives and followed shortly after to the scene of
the disturbance. He went into the church with Sergeant Brown and three
detectives. Lieutenant Rank forced a number of the mob to leave the church
and locked the doors. Captain Hogan, of the Tenth Police Precinct, and
Chief Garrity arrived about this time. The three Negroes were taken through
a rear entrance to a patrol wagon in the alley and removed to the Hyde Park
police station, a considerable distance away.
</p>

<p>
The crowd in front of the church had grown by this time to 3,000 or 4,000.
In order to quiet them they were again addressed by Father Burke, who told
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
them the Negroes had been removed from the church. They dispersed
about 10:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
</p>

<p>
Profiting by the experience of 1919 Chief Garrity made prompt use of
prearranged plans to check all such disorders in their incipiency. He immediately
closed saloons and "clubs" in which young hoodlums were accustomed
to gather. He had the police patrol the streets by twos. He drew a "dead
line" to prevent Negroes from entering the district. With his forces well
organized and distributed, he set up headquarters at the Stock Yards Precinct
station and spent the night there, with Captain Westbrook, commander of
the second battalion of police, Captain Hogan, and Lieutenant Ira McDonnell,
of the Desplaines Street station. Street cars and automobiles approaching
the police "dead line" were stopped and all Negro passengers warned off.
Street gatherings were broken up and people were searched for weapons.
People were also kept moving in the streets. This display of force undoubtedly
had its quieting effect. Nevertheless, a stray Negro was here and there
attacked despite the vigilance of the police.
</p>

<p>
During the five or six hours following the murder, racial street fights
occurred at Forty-fifth Street and Wabash Avenue. A mob stormed a house
at 229 East Forty-fifth Street, attempted to burn it and did considerable
damage. Frank Gavin, a white man, 1509 Marquette Road, was shot in the
back during the mobbing of a Negro at Fifty-third Street and Racine Avenue.
Hoodlums pulled Negroes from street cars and beat them. A Negro who had
been dragged from a car at Thirty-ninth and Emerald Avenue, was rescued by
several white women after he had been severely beaten with clubs. A man
and a small boy, Negroes, were attacked by a gang at Fuller Park, Forty-fifth
Street and Shields Avenue. At Forty-seventh and Halsted streets three
Negroes were taken from a car and slugged, and two others had a similar
experience at Forty-seventh Street and Union Avenue. Frank Stevens, a
white man, 3738 Langley Avenue, was badly injured by a crowd of Negroes
at Thirty-ninth Street and Normal Avenue.
</p>

<p>
Precautions were continued next day for the protection of Negroes working
in the Stock Yards, and frequenting the district where the disorders had
occurred. This district ran as far west as Racine Avenue and as far east as
Prairie; as far north as Thirty-second Street and as far south as Fifty-third
Street. Negroes working at the Stock Yards had police escorts to and from
their work, and the car lines on Halsted and Forty-seventh and Thirty-fifth
streets, and on Racine Avenue, which are much used by the Negroes, were
especially guarded. Only one clash was recorded the following day. By
six o'clock Wednesday morning, thirty-seven hours after the murder, the
special police concentration was discontinued.
</p>

<p>
Nine persons in all were reported injured during this disturbance. Nine
men were arrested, including the three Negroes whom Barrett had encountered.
These three were: Samuel Hayes, forty years old, 519 East Thirty-fifth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
Street; Henry Snow, thirty-two years old, 517 East Thirty-fifth Street;
and Frank Gatewood, forty-three years old, 3446 Prairie Avenue.
</p>

<p>
Witnesses at the inquest differed as to whether there was any provocation
for the stabbing of Barrett. Only one of them testified that he heard any of
the four persons say anything. This was Carl Duwell, a printer, 466 West
Twenty-fourth Place, who had just alighted from a Halsted Street car. He
said that Barrett was following the three colored men and seemed to be threatening
them, saying "You want to fight?" One of the Negroes suddenly turned
and struck at Barrett, slashing his throat. The Negroes had been walking fast,
with Barrett following a few feet behind them. After he was struck, Barrett
staggered a few feet to the curb and fell.
</p>

<p>
Barrett's widow said he was not in the habit of carrying weapons, but it
was current talk that he had been arrested a number of times for street fights
with Negroes. He had been a policeman in the service of the South Park
Commission, and was an ex-soldier. William Sianis, at whose stand Barrett
had his shoes shined just before the murder, said that Barrett was apparently
sober. Neighborhood gossip was to the effect that Barrett had been drinking
at McNally's saloon at Forty-seventh and Halsted streets. Also Duwell's
testimony indicated that Barrett had been drinking.
</p>

<p>
According to Police Captain Hogan, when the Negroes were arrested in
the church, knives were found on the persons of two of them. One of these,
Sam Hayes, admitted to the police at that time that he had stabbed a white
man at Forty-seventh and Halsted streets. His story was that when he asked
the newsboy at the corner for a newspaper in which to wrap his overalls,
Barrett threatened him and then struck him, and the stabbing followed.
</p>

<p>
During the night following the murder, Chief of Police Garrity issued a
statement which was published conspicuously in the morning newspapers,
and was most effectively worded to prevent misunderstanding of the incident
and avert use of it to inflame racial hostility. The statement began:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There has been no race riot. The killing at Forty-seventh and Halsted streets
was merely a street-corner fight. There was grave danger that it would be followed
by serious trouble. Precautionary measures were taken at once to forestall the recurrence
of the riots, with the destruction of life and property, of last summer.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This was followed by a detailed account of the special measures and
distribution of police to handle the situation.
</p>

<h3>
II. <span class="smcap">The Springfield Riot</span><br />
August 14-15, 1908
</h3>

<p>
The race riot at Springfield, Illinois, in August, 1908, which cost the lives
of two Negroes and four white men, is an outstanding example of the racial
bitterness and brutality that can be provoked by unsubstantiated rumor or,
as in this case, by deliberate falsehood. The two Negro victims were innocent
and unoffending. They were lynched under the shadow of the capitol of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
Lincoln's state, within half a mile of the only home he ever owned, and two
miles from the monument which marks the grave of the great emancipator.
</p>

<p>
A second fundamental factor in the Springfield riot situation was the
fertile field prepared by admittedly lax law enforcement and by tolerance in
the community of vicious conditions, the worst of which were permitted to
surround the Negro areas.
</p>

<p>
The spark which touched off the explosion was the old story of the violation
of a white woman by a Negro, and not until the damage had been done was
its falsity confessed by the woman who had told it.
</p>

<p>
On the night of Friday, August 14, 1908, according to her story, Mrs.
Hâ€”â€”, wife of a street-railway conductor, was asleep in her room. She was
alone in the house. She declared that a Negro entered, dragged her from her
bed to the back yard, and there committed the crime. She said she had
attempted to scream but was choked by her assailant, who left her lying unconscious
in the garden.
</p>

<p>
A Negro, George Richardson, who had been at work on a neighboring
lawn the day before the attack, was accused by Mrs. Hâ€”â€” and was arrested
when he returned to work the next morning. He was placed in the county
jail and on August 19 he was indicted.
</p>

<p>
During inquiry by a special grand jury certain facts were disclosed concerning
Mrs. Hâ€”'s character, and she admitted that, though she had been
brutally beaten by a white man on the night indicated, Richardson was not
present and had no connection with the affair. She admitted that she had
not been raped. For reasons known only to herself, she wished to keep the
name of the real assailant a secret, and therefore she had accused Richardson.
She signed an affidavit exonerating him. Richardson had no criminal record.
He and two of his family were property owners in Springfield.
</p>

<p>
While Richardson was in custody and before he was exonerated, feeling
against him was intensified because of the murder, three or four weeks before,
of Clergy A. Ballard, a white man, by Joe James, a Negro tramp, who was a
drug and whiskey addict. James had been taken from a freight train and placed
in jail for thirty days and had been released on the night of the crime. He
was charged with entering the room of Ballard's daughter, Blanche, at
night. Ballard grappled with him, but James broke away and ran. In the
struggle Ballard was mortally injured. James was found asleep in a park
near the Ballard home about noon the next day, under the influence of a
drug. He was tried and hanged, and his body was taken back to Mississippi
by his mother for interment. Rev. Mr. Dawson, spiritual adviser of James,
stated that James declared he had no knowledge of the crime.
</p>

<p>
Springfield was, therefore, in a receptive mood when, on the morning of
Friday, August 15, it got the first rumors concerning the attack on Mrs. Hâ€”â€”.
Richardson had been taken before her and partially identified. In the afternoon,
when it became known that he had been arrested, crowds gathered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
about the jail. They seemed good-natured rather than blood-thirsty. It
was also known that James, accused of the Ballard murder, occupied a cell in
the jail. The sheriff preserved order through the afternoon, no effort being
made to disperse the crowd of 300 or 400 persons. About five o'clock Richardson
and James were taken in an automobile to Sherman, north of Springfield, and
there they were transferred by train to Bloomington.
</p>

<p>
About 7:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> leadership began to develop in the mob about the jail.
The leaders demanded the two Negroes, but were finally convinced by the
sheriff that they were not in the jail. Then the story spread that Harry
Loper, a restaurant keeper, had provided the automobile in which the men had
been removed. The crowd rushed to the restaurant five blocks away. In
response to the mob's hootings Loper appeared in the doorway with a firearm
in his hand. About 8:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> someone threw a brick through a plate-glass
window and in a few minutes the front of the restaurant had been smashed
out. Then followed the complete wrecking of the restaurant, as well as the
owner's automobile, which had been standing in front.
</p>

<p>
When the mob began to surge through the town the Fire Department was
called to disperse it, but the mob cut the hose. Control having been lost
by the sheriff and police, Governor Deneen called out the militia. The mob,
by this time very much excited, started for the Negro district through Washington
Street, along which a large number of Negroes lived on upper floors.
Raiding second-hand stores which belonged to white men, the mob secured
guns, axes, and other weapons with which it destroyed places of business
operated by Negroes and drove out all of the Negro residents from Washington
Street. Then it turned north into Ninth Street.
</p>

<p>
At the northeast corner of Ninth and Jefferson streets was the frame
barber shop of Scott Burton, a Negro. The mob set fire to this building.
From that point it went a block farther north to Madison Street and then turned
east and began firing all the shacks in which Negroes and whites lived in that
street.
</p>

<p>
Burton, the first victim of the mob's violence, was lynched in the yard
back of his shop. The mob tied a rope around his neck and dragged him
through the streets. An effort was then made to burn the body, which had
been hung to a tree. This was at two o'clock in the morning.
</p>

<p>
About this time a company of militia arrived from Decatur, Illinois,
and proceeded through Madison Street to Twelfth Street, where the mob was
engaged in mutilating Burton's body, riddling it with bullets. The mob was
twice ordered to disperse, and the militia fired in the air twice. The third
time the troops fired into the ankles and legs of the mob. At least two of the
men in the mob were wounded and the mob quickly gave way.
</p>

<p>
By this time the Negroes were badly frightened and began leaving town.
Meanwhile, Governor Deneen had sent for more troops, including two regiments
from Chicago. Before the rioting ended 5,000 militiamen were patrolling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
the streets of Springfield. On Saturday morning the militia began to arrive
in force, including detachments from Chicago. This was a comparatively
quiet day, but that night another Negro was lynched within a block of the
State House. The mob gathered on the Court House Square and marched
south on Fifth Street to Monroe, west on Monroe to Spring, and south on
Spring to Edwards. At the southeast corner of Spring and Edwards streets
a Negro named Donegan and his family had lived for many years. Donegan
was eighty-four years old and owned the half-block of ground where he lived.
He was found sleeping in his own yard and was quickly strung up to a tree
across the street. Then his throat was cut and his body mutilated. The
troops interfered at this point and cut down the man, taking him in an ambulance
to the hospital, where he died the following morning. Donegan's only
offense seems to have been that he had had a white wife for more than thirty
years. He bore a good reputation, and the mob had found no reason for lynching
him.
</p>

<p>
Abe Raymer, who was supposed to have been the leader of the mob,
was charged with the murder of Donegan, but was released.
</p>

<p>
As an example of the disorder which occurred Friday evening, it is narrated
that Eugene W. Chafin, Prohibition candidate for the presidency, was delivering
an address on the east side of the public square. A Negro pursued by the mob
ran toward the speaker's stand from Fifth and Washington streets, where he
had been pulled from a street car. Two men helped him to the speaker's
stand, while Chafin at the front of the platform threatened to shoot into the
crowd. Although he had no revolver he made a motion toward his hip pocket.
During the mÃªlÃ©e before gaining the platform the Negro drew a knife from his
pocket and slashed several white men. When he had escaped from the rear
of the platform, missiles flew in the direction of Mr. Chafin, one of them hitting
him on the head.
</p>

<p>
Four men were rounded up who had been blacked up to resemble Negroes
and had been firing on soldiers during the night in an effort to substantiate
the assertion that the Negroes did not welcome the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Sunday was quiet. No effort was made to reorganize the mob. The
whole city was as if under martial law. The saloons were shut and every place
of business was closed at 9:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
</p>

<p>
The people who took part in the mob violence had no grievances against
the Negroes. They were hoodlums and underworld folk. Many of the
hoodlums, according to one observer, were less than twenty years old.
</p>

<p>
During the rioting four white men were killed. They were: Louis Johnson,
of 1208 East Reynolds Street, whose body was found at the foot of the stairs
leading to the barroom in Loper's restaurant. He was shot through the
abdomen; John Colwell, of 1517 Matheny Street, who died at St. John's
Hospital; J. W. Scott, of 125 East Adams Street, who was shot in the lungs;
Frank Delmore, who was killed by a stray bullet.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Seventy-nine persons were injured. The property destroyed included
Loper's restaurant and automobile, Scott Burton's barber shop, the Delmonico
saloon, and one block of houses between Tenth and Eleventh streets, which were
burned, with all their contents. Scores of families were left destitute. Many
Negroes were severely beaten before they were able to escape from the district.
Numbers of these homeless colored people swarmed to neighboring towns and
to Chicago. Three thousand of them were concentrated at Camp Lincoln,
the National Guard camp grounds. Some of the refugees were cared for at
the arsenal.
</p>

<p>
Current comment concerning the riots suggested political corruption and
laxity of law enforcement as important underlying causes of the riots. An assistant
state's attorney in Springfield charged that saloons had long been violating
the law, and that the law was not generally enforced as it ought to be. He
cited these conditions as responsible in large measure for the rioting and murders.
Pastors in their sermons on the riot focused attention on the way in which
vicious elements were permitted to flout the law with impunity. This comment
came so generally and insistently from those conversant with the situation
that the <i>Chicago Daily News</i> was led to remark editorially upon the responsibility
of the public authorities of Springfield. It said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Vice and other forms of law breaking have been given wide latitude here. The
notoriety of Springfield's evil resorts has been widespread.
</p>

<p>
A mob which murders, burns and loots, is a highly undesirable substitute even
for a complacent city administration. It is a logical result, however, of long temporizing
with vice and harboring of the vicious. When a mob begins to shoot and hang,
to destroy and pillage, there is instant recognition on the part of responsible persons
of the beauty of law enforcement and of general orderliness.
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the Sunday following the riots some Springfield saloon-keepers took
advantage of the fact that large crowds of sight-seers had come to town to
open their places, in violation of the order by Mayor Reece to remain closed.
Some of them were arrested for defiance of the mayor's proclamation to remain
closed until order had been restored.
</p>

<p>
By Monday or Tuesday order was pretty well restored in Springfield.
Some of the National Guard troops were kept on duty for several days. Almost
100 arrests were made, and a special grand jury returned more than fifty
indictments.
</p>

<h3>
III. <span class="smcap">East St. Louis Riots</span><br />
May 28 and July 2, 1917
</h3>

<p>
Following a period of bitter racial feeling, frequently marked by open
friction, a clash between whites and Negroes in East St. Louis, Illinois, occurred
on May 28, 1917, in which, following rumors that a white man had been killed
by Negroes, a number of Negroes were beaten by a mob of white men. This
outbreak was the forerunner of a much more serious riot on July 2, in which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
at least thirty-nine Negroes and eight white people were killed, much property
was destroyed by fire, and the local authorities proved so ineffective and
demoralized that the state militia was required to restore order. A Congressional
Committee investigated the facts of the riot and the underlying conditions,
which included industrial disturbances and shameful corruption in
local government.<a name='FA_13' id='FA_13' href='#FN_13' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a>
</p>

<p>
The coroner of St. Clair County in which East St. Louis is situated, held
thirty-eight inquests, as a result of which it was found that twenty-six of these
deaths had been due to gun-shot wounds, four to drowning, four to burns,
two to fractured skulls, one to hemorrhage of the brain, and one to pneumonia
after a fracture of the thyroid cartilage. Hundreds of persons were estimated
to have been more or less seriously injured, seventy having been treated in St.
Mary's Hospital. It has been impossible to get an accurate accounting of the
deaths and injuries. One man who had taken a deep interest in the situation estimated
that from 200 to 300 Negroes were killed.
</p>

<p>
About 200 people were arrested. Some of these were released, some were
charged with rioting and conspiracy, and others with arson. Two white women
were tried for conspiracy and rioting, and fined $50.00. Ten Negroes were
convicted of rioting and murder. Indictments of 104 white persons grew out
of the immediate activities of the rioters. Three policemen were among those
indicted for murder in connection with firing upon Negro bystanders. In
this same group of assailants were seven soldiers who were court-martialed.
No finding in their cases has been announced. Three white men were indicted
for murder in connection with a raid upon a street-car load of Negro passengers
in which a father and son were killed, a mother was wounded severely, and a
little daughter escaped. Twenty-six men, two of them Negroes, were indicted
for arson.
</p>

<p>
The effort to bring the guilty to justice was commented upon and summarized
by this Congressional Committee as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Assistant Attorney General Middlekauf had active charge of the prosecutions
growing out of the riot, and he showed neither fear nor favor. Capable, determined,
and courageous, he allowed neither political influence nor personal appeals to swerve
him from the strict line of duty.
</p>

<p>
As a result of these prosecutions by the attorney general's office 11 Negroes and
8 white men are in the State penitentiary, 2 additional white men have been sentenced
to prison terms, 14 white men have been given jail sentences, 27 white men, including
the former night chief of police and three policemen, have pleaded guilty to rioting
and have been punished.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
</p>

<p>
These convictions were obtained in the face of organized, determined effort,
backed with abundant funds, to head off the prosecutions and convictions. In the
case of Mayor Mollman there seems to have been an open, paid advertising campaign
to slander and intimidate the attorney general.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The burned area of the city was on Fifth Street, Broadway, Walnut Street,
Eighth Street, Eleventh Street and Bond Avenue, as well as "the Flats" on
Seventh Street, between Division and Missouri avenues. This latter area
was that occupied by Negroes. There were 312 buildings and forty-four
railroad cars totally or partially destroyed, with a total loss of $393,600.
</p>

<p>
The riots in East St. Louis may be traced, more or less directly, to a
number of causes, the influence of each being apparent.
</p>

<p>
Without doubt conditions resulting from the migration of a large number
of Negroes from the South, a movement which was more or less general at
that time, account in large measure for the riots, but also involved in it all
are the facts that there had been industrial friction, and that the city was
flagrantly misgoverned.
</p>

<p>
The Congressional Committee observed an effort to shift the blame from
one element to another. The labor interests sought to place responsibility
for the riots upon the employers, who, they said, had brought great numbers
of Negroes to East St. Louis in order that they might more readily dominate
the employment situation. The employers, on the other hand, thought the
blame rested upon the city and county administration because of laxity in law
enforcement, exploitation of Negroes for political purposes, and all sorts of
political corruption, including the "protection" of vice and crime. The
political ring sought to dodge responsibility by emphasizing economic and
industrial causes of the outbreak.
</p>

<p>
Whatever may have been the conditions resulting from the influx of
Negroes, they were undoubtedly actuated by a desire to improve their condition.
Some 10,000 or 12,000 Negroes had come to St. Clair County from the
South during the winter of 1916-17. During the year and a half preceding
the riot, the number of such migrants was estimated at 18,000, although it
was reported that many had returned during the winter of 1916-17, because
of the unaccustomed cold climate. It is certain that this influx severely
taxed the housing accommodations of East St. Louis, which were of the insanitary
and inadequate nature that so often characterizes urban districts in which
the Negroes find that they must live. The report of the Congressional Committee
on this point says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is a lamentable fact that the employers of labor paid too little heed to the comfort
or welfare of their men. They saw them crowded into wretched cabins without
water or any of the conveniences of life, their wives and children condemned to live in
the disreputable quarters of the town, and made no effort to lift them out of the mire.
The Negroes gravitated to the insanitary sections, existed in the squalor of filthy
cabins and made no complaint, but the white workmen had a higher outlook, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
failure to provide them with better homes added to their bitter dissatisfaction with
the burdens placed upon them by having to compete with black labor.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is likewise in evidence that special inducements were offered to the
southern Negroes to come to East St. Louis, as well as to other industrial
centers in the North. Advertisements were placed in southern newspapers,
offering employment at wages far in excess of those paid in the South. Low
railroad rates were offered, and in some instances during this general migration
the railroads are said to have transported Negroes free in order that they might
be employed by the railroads. Failures of crops in the South, floods and ill
treatment of Negroes there, coupled with the hope that they would find
fairer treatment in the North, as well as better wages and living conditions,
were the direct causes of migration. After this had become fairly general
it was further stimulated by Negroes who had come North, and who wrote
home painting northern conditions in glowing colors.
</p>

<p>
From the industrial point of view it should be noted that in the summer
of 1916 there had been a strike of 4,000 white men in the packing-plants of
East St. Louis. It was asserted that Negroes were used in these plants as
strike breakers. A report on the Negro migration by the United States
Department of Labor states that when the strike was ended Negroes were still
employed, and some of the white men lost their positions. It says further:
"The white leaders undoubtedly realized that the effectiveness of striking was
materially lessened by this importation of black workers."
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, it is stated in the report of the Congressional Committee
that the Aluminum Ore Company, during a strike, brought hundreds of Negroes
to the city as strike breakers in order to defeat organized labor, "a precedent
which aroused intense hatred and antagonism, and caused countless tragedies
as its aftermath. The feeling of resentment grew with each succeeding day.
White men walked the streets in idleness and their families suffered for food
and warmth and clothes, while their places as laborers were taken by strange
Negroes who were compelled to live in hovels and who were used to keep
down wages."
</p>

<p>
In May, 1917, a strike followed demands which had been made upon the
Aluminum Ore Company by the "Aluminum Ore Employees' Protective
Association." These related to alleged injustices and discriminations said
to have been practiced against the employees. The company failed to comply
with these demands, and a thousand white workers struck.
</p>

<p>
Closely related to this situation was a notice sent to the delegates of the
Central Trades Labor Union by the secretary of the Union, dated May 23,
which declared that the immigration of the southern Negro had reached a
point where "drastic action must be taken if we intend to work and to live
peaceably in this community." This notice declared that these men were
being used "to the detriment of our white citizens by some of the capitalists
and a few real estate owners." It called a meeting to present to the mayor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
and city council a demand for action to "retard this growing menace, and also
devise a way to get rid of a certain portion of those who are already here."
The notice read further: "This is not a protest against the Negro who has
long been a resident of East St. Louis, and is a law abiding citizen."
</p>

<p>
This meeting was held on May 28 in the auditorium of the city hall and
was attended not only by the labor men but also by a large number of other
persons. The Congressional Committee refers to one of the speakers at this
meeting as "an attorney of some ability and no character." The report of
the Committee says that he virtually advised the killing of Negroes and
burning of their homes. The report says further:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
He was not authorized to speak for those who went there to protest against the
lawlessness which disgraced the city and the presence of thousands of Negroes who it
is claimed were taking the places of the white workmen, but his inflammatory speech
caused many of his hearers to rush into the street and to resort to acts of violence....
He was in full sympathy with the action of the mob. They followed his advice and
the scenes of murder and arson that ensued were the logical result of his utterances.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That night, May 28, following the meeting, a crowd of white people
assembled in front of the police station and clamored for Negro prisoners.
A rumor circulated through the crowd that a white man had just been killed
by Negroes, and parts of the crowd left, forming a mob which severely beat
a number of Negroes whom it met. The situation was so serious that the mayor
called for troops. The trouble subsided, however. It is important to note
that from this time until the riot of July 1-2, no effort was made to strengthen
the police force nor were any other steps taken to control the situation.
</p>

<p>
In connection with the industrial phase of the situation, it should be
remembered that the war had cut off the normal supply of foreign labor, and
that not a few white workers had left East St. Louis for other industrial centers.
Most of the Negro migrants were unskilled workers, and their competition
was, therefore, with the unskilled white workers. One witness before the
Congressional Committee expressed the view that the labor shortage in East
St. Louis prior to the riot certainly did not justify the great influx of Negroes,
but it is of record that most of the newcomers got profitable employment in
unskilled occupations.
</p>

<p>
The employers were fighting unions of any sort, whether of whites or
Negroes. Unions were seeking membership of Negroes as well as whites in
the hope that the use of Negroes as strike breakers might be prevented.
Whether union men or not, the white workers resented the influx of Negro
workers who might take their jobs. The inevitable consequence was friction
between whites and Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The Congressional Committee laid great stress upon corrupt politics as
the leading cause of the riots of July 2. It disclosed an almost unbelievable
combination of shameless corruption, tolerance of vice and crime, maladministration,
and debauchery of the courts. The report says that East St. Louis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
for many years was a plague spot, harboring within its borders "every offense
in the calendar of crime" and committing openly "every lapse in morals and
public decency." Politicians looted its treasury, gave away valuable franchises,
and elected plunderers to high office. Graft, collusion with crime and
vice, and desecration of office were openly and deliberately practiced. Criminals
were attracted and welcomed, and the good people of the community
were powerless. Owners of large corporations and manufacturers pitted white
against black labor, giving no thought to their thousands of workmen living
in hovels, the victims of "poverty and disease, of long hours and incessant
labor."
</p>

<p>
The mayor, continues the report, was a tool of dishonest politicians, the
electorate was "debauched," the police were a conscienceless bunch of grafters,
and the revenue of the city was largely derived from saloons and dens of vice.
</p>

<p>
Several officials and politicians of high standing were singled out by the
Committee for especial condemnation as the "brains of the city's corruption."
</p>

<p>
A great deal of the city's crime and vice was concentrated in what is known
as "Black Valley." This was the section in which the Negroes lived, but
much of the vice and crime was promoted and practiced by vicious whites.
There was much mixing of whites and Negroes in the vilest practices.
</p>

<p>
Similar conditions existed in the town of Brooklyn near by, with about
3,000 people, of whom only about fifty were white. Its dens of iniquity were
notorious and were the resort of many white people. So openly operated
were these resorts that the Congressional Committee reported that in the
Brooklyn high school "24 out of 25 girls who were in the graduating class
went to the bad in the saloons and dance halls and failed to receive their
diplomas."
</p>

<p>
Not only were conditions of this sort demoralizing and degrading for the
decent Negroes, but the sanitary conditions were likewise extremely bad.
Some of the houses in the Negro districts had not been painted for fifteen
years and were in a state of great disrepair. Their setting consisted largely
of pools of stagnant water and beds of weeds. At one period during the
migration Negroes were coming in so fast that even these miserable housing
conditions were inadequate, and some of them were forced to live in sheds.
In one instance sixty-nine newcomers were found living in one small house.
Whenever houses were vacated by white people and rented to Negroes, the
rental price was largely increased, sometimes doubled.
</p>

<p>
After reviewing the corruption in East St. Louis, the report of the Congressional
Committee discussed the riot. It described the condition of affairs
on the night of July 1, 1917, when the second and most serious outbreak
occurred. An automobile (some witnesses said two) went through the Negro
section of the city, its occupants firing promiscuously into homes. This aroused
fierce resentment among the Negroes, who organized for defense and armed
themselves with guns. The ringing of the church bell, a prearranged signal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
for assembling, drew a crowd of them, and they marched through the streets
ready to avenge the attack. A second automobile filled with white men
crossed their path. The Negroes cursed them, commanded them to drive on,
and fired a volley into the machine. The occupants, however, were not the
rioters but policemen and reporters. One policeman was killed and another
was so seriously wounded that he died later.
</p>

<p>
Thousands viewed the riddled car standing before police headquarters.
The early editions of the newspapers gave full accounts of the tragedy, and
on July 2 the rioting began. Negro mobs shot white men, and white men
and boys, girls and women, began to attack every Negro in sight. News
spread rapidly and, as excitement increased, unimaginable depredations and
horrible tortures were committed and viewed with "placid unconcern" by
hundreds. Negro men were stabbed, clubbed, and hanged from telephone
poles. Their homes were burned. Women and children were not spared.
An instance is given of a Negro child two years old which was shot and thrown
into a doorway of a burning building.
</p>

<p>
On the night of July 1, Mayor Mollman telephoned to the Adjutant
General of Illinois saying that the police were no longer able to handle the
situation and requesting that the militia be sent. Both the police and the
militia are severely censured by the Congressional report for gross failure to
do their duty. The police, says the report, could have quelled the riot instantly,
but instead they either "fled into the safety of cowardly seclusion or listlessly
watched the depredations of the mob, passively and in many instances actively
sharing in the work."
</p>

<p>
In all, five companies of the Illinois National Guard were sent to East
St. Louis. Some of them arrived on the morning of July 2, the first at
8:40 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> These forces were in command of Colonel S. O. Tripp. Concerning
the conduct of the militia, the Congressional Committee reported in strong
terms, singling out Colonel Tripp for especial condemnation. It said that he
was a hindrance instead of a help to the troops; that "he was ignorant of
his duties, blind to his responsibilities and deaf to every intelligent appeal
that was made to him."
</p>

<p>
The troops, in the estimation of the Committee, were poorly officered
and in only a few cases did their duty. The report states that "they seemed
moved by the same spirit of indifference or cowardice that marked the conduct
of the police force. As a rule they fraternized with the mob, joked with them
and made no serious effort to restrain them."
</p>

<p>
Many instances are given of active participation and encouragement of
the mob in its murders, arson, and general destruction.
</p>

<p>
The only redeeming feature of the activities of the militia, according to
the Congressional Committee, was "the conduct, bravery, and skill of the officer
second in command, whose promptness and determination prevented the mob
from committing many more atrocities."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
</p>

<p>
By eight o'clock of the evening of July 2 there were seventeen officers and
270 men on duty, and by July 4 the force had increased to thirty-seven officers
and 1,411 men. On the evening of July 2 the fury of the mob had spent itself,
and the riot subsided.
</p>

<p>
The behavior of the troops was condemned not only by the Congressional
Committee but by citizens generally, and a special inquiry was made into their
conduct by the Military and Naval Department of the State of Illinois.
Witnesses to dereliction on duty on the part of the soldiers were examined
and commanding officers of troops were asked to testify and explain specific
acts of violence and neglect of duty. In all seventy-nine persons were examined.
Although the charges against the soldiers in a large number of cases were serious
and sufficient to warrant the criticism which they received, identification of
individuals guilty of these acts was difficult. This probably accounts for
the fact that only seven court-martials resulted from the inquiry. The commanding
officer, though severely censured by the Congressional Committee,
was exonerated by this inquiry.

CHAPTER III
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE MIGRATION OF NEGROES FROM THE SOUTH</span>
</h2>

<h4>
I. INTRODUCTION
</h4>

<p>
During the period 1916-18 approximately a half-million Negroes suddenly
moved from southern to northern states. This movement, however, was not
without a precedent. A similar migration occurred in 1879, when Negroes
moved from Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee, and North
Carolina to Kansas. The origin of this earlier movement, its causes, and
manner resemble in many respects the one which has so recently attracted
public attention.
</p>

<p>
The migration of 1916-18 cannot be separated completely from the steady,
though inconspicuous, exodus from southern to northern states that has been in
progress since 1860, or, in fact, since the operation of the "underground railway."
In 1900 there were 911,025 Negroes living in the North, 10.3 per cent of the
total Negro population, which was then 8,883,994. Census figures for the
period 1900-1910 show a net loss for southern states east of the Mississippi
of 595,703 Negroes. Of this number 366,880 are found in northern states.
Reliable estimates for the last decade place the increase of northern Negro
population around 500,000.
</p>

<p>
The 1910-20 increase of the Negro population of Chicago was from 44,103
to 109,594, or 148.5 per cent, with a corresponding increase in the white
population of 21 per cent, including foreign immigration. According to the
Census Bureau method of estimating natural increase of population, the Negro
population of Chicago unaffected by the migration would be 58,056 in 1920,
and the increase by migration alone would be 51,538.
</p>

<p>
The relative 1910-20 increases in white and Negro population in typical
industrial cities of the Middle West, given in Table II, illustrate the effect of
the migration of southern Negroes.
</p>

<p>
<i>The migration to Chicago.</i>â€”Within a period of eighteen months in 1917-18
more than 50,000 Negroes came to Chicago according to an estimate based
on averages taken from actual count of daily arrivals. All of those who came,
however, did not stay. Chicago was a re-routing point, and many immigrants
went on to nearby cities and towns. During the heaviest period,
for example, a Detroit social agency reported that hundreds of Negroes applying
there for work stated that they were from Chicago. The tendency appears
to have been to reach those fields offering the highest present wages and
permanent prospects.

<h4>
II. CAUSES OF THE MIGRATION
</h4>

<p>
A series of circumstances acting together in an unusual combination both
provoked and made possible the migration of Negroes from the South on a
large scale. The causes of the movement fall into definite divisions, even
as stated by the migrants themselves. For example, one of the most frequent
causes mentioned by southern Negroes for their change of home is the treatment
accorded them in the South. Yet this treatment of which they complain
has been practiced since their emancipation, and fifty years afterward more
than nine-tenths of the Negro population of the United States still remained
in the South. "Higher wages" was also commonly stated as a cause of the
movement, yet thousands came to the North and to Chicago who in the South
had been earning more in their professions and even in skilled occupations
than they expected to receive in the North. These causes then divide into
two main classes: (1) economic causes, (2) sentimental causes. Each has a
bearing on both North and South. The following statements are based on
reports prepared by trustworthy agencies during the migration, on letters and
statements from migrants, Negroes and whites living in the South and the
North, and on family history obtained by the Commission's investigators.
</p>

<h3>
I. ECONOMIC CAUSES OF THE MIGRATION
</h3>

<h4>
A. THE SOUTH
</h4>

<p>
<i>Low wages.</i>â€”Wages of Negroes in the South varied from 75 cents a day
on the farms to $1.75 a day in certain city jobs, in the period just preceding
1914. The rise in living costs which followed the outbreak of the war outstripped
the rise in wages. In Alabama the price paid for day labor in the
twenty-one "black belt" counties averaged 50 and 60 cents a day. It ranged
from 40 cents, as a minimum, to 75 cents, and, in a few instances, $1.00
was a maximum for able-bodied male farm hands.<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a>
</p>

<p>
A Negro minister, writing in the <i>Montgomery</i> (Alabama) <i>Advertiser</i>, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Negro farm hand gets for his compensation hardly more than the mule he
plows; that is, his board and shelter. Some mules fare better than Negroes. This,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
too, in spite of the fact that the money received for farm products has advanced
more than 100 per cent. The laborer has not shared correspondingly in this advance.
</p>

<p>
High rents and low wages have driven the Negro off the farms. They have no
encouragement to work. Only here and there you will find a tenant who is getting
a square deal and the proper encouragement.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A white man, writing in the same paper, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There is an article in today's <i>Advertiser</i> headed "Exodus of the Negroes to Be
Probed." Why hunt for a cause when it's plain as the noonday sun the Negro is
leaving this country for higher wages? He doesn't want to leave here but he knows
if he stays here he will starve. They have made no crops, they have nothing to eat,
no clothes, no shoes, and they can't get any work to do, and they are leaving just as
fast as they can get away.... If the Negro race could get work at 50 cents per
day he would stay here. He don't want to go. He is easily satisfied and will live
on half rations and will never complain.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Atlanta Independent</i>, white, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
If our white neighbors will treat the Negro kindly, recognizing his rights as a
man, advance his wages in proportion as the cost of living advances, he will need
no ordinance nor legislation to keep the Negro here. The South is his natural home.
He prefers to be here, he loves its traditions, its ideals and its people. But he cannot
stay here and starve....
</p>

<p>
When meat was 15 cents a pound and flour $8 a barrel, the Negro received from
$4 to $8 a week. Now meat is 30 cents a pound and flour $16 a barrel, and the Negro
is receiving the same wages. He cannot live on this and the white man cannot expect
him to live in the South and live on the starvation wages he is paying him, when the
fields and the factories in the North are offering him living wages.

<p class="caption">TYPICAL PLANTATION HOMES IN THE SOUTH OF MIGRANTS TO CHICAGO
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>The boll weevil.</i>â€”In 1915 and 1916 the boll weevil cotton pest so ravaged
sections of the South that thousands of farmers were almost ruined. Cotton
crops were lost, and the farmers were forced to change from cotton to food
products. The growing of cotton requires about thirty times as many "hands"
as food products. As a result many Negroes were thrown out of employment.
The damage wrought by the boll weevil was augmented by destructive storms
and floods, which not only affected crops but made the living conditions of
Negroes more miserable.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lack of capital.</i>â€”The "credit system" is a very convenient and common
practice in many parts of the South. Money is borrowed for upkeep until
the selling season, when it is repaid in one lump sum. The succession of short
crops and the destruction due to the boll weevil and storms occasioned heavy
demands for capital to carry labor through the fall and early winter until a
new crop could be started. There was a shortage of capital, and as a result
there was little opportunity for work. During this period many white persons
migrated from sections of the South most seriously affected.
</p>

<p>
<i>"Unsatisfactory" living conditions.</i>â€”The plantation cabins and segregated
sections in cities where municipal laxity made home surroundings undesirable
have been stated as another contributing cause of the movement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Lack of school facilities.</i>â€”The desire to place their children in good schools
was a reason often given by migrants with families for leaving the South.
School facilities are described as lamentably poor even by southern whites.
Perhaps the most thorough statement of these conditions is given in a <i>Study
of Negro Education</i> by Thomas Jesse Jones, made under the direction of the
federal Bureau of Education, and comparing provisions for white and Negro
children in fifteen southern states and the District of Columbia. He states:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In the South they [Negroes] form 29.8 per cent of the total population, the
proportion in Mississippi and South Carolina being over 55 per cent and ranging in
the "black belt" counties from 50 to 90 per cent of the total population. Almost
3,000,000 are engaged in agricultural pursuits. They form 40.4 per cent of all persons
engaged in these pursuits in the Southern States.
</p>

<p>
Though the United States census shows a decrease in illiteracy, there are still
about 2,225,000 Negroes illiterate in the South, or over 33 per cent of the Negro
population ten years of age and over.

<p>
The supervisor of white elementary rural schools in one of the states recently
wrote concerning the Negro schools:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I never visit one of these [Negro] schools without feeling that we are wasting
a large part of this money and are neglecting a great opportunity. The Negro schoolhouses
are miserable beyond all description. They are usually without comfort,
equipment, proper lighting, or sanitation. Nearly all of the Negroes of school age
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
in the district are crowded into these miserable structures during the short term
which the school runs. Most of the teachers are absolutely untrained and have been
given certificates by the county board, not because they have passed the examination,
but because it is necessary to have some kind of a Negro teacher. Among the Negro
rural schools which I have visited, I have found only one in which the highest class
knew the multiplication table."
</p>
</div>

<p>
A state superintendent writes:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"There has never been any serious attempt in this state to offer adequate educational
facilities for the colored race. The average length of the term for the state
is only four months; practically all of the schools are taught in dilapidated churches,
which, of course, are not equipped with suitable desks, blackboards, and the other
essentials of a school; practically all of the teachers are incompetent, possessing
little or no education and having had no professional training whatever, except a few
weeks obtained in the summer schools; the schools are generally overcrowded,
some of them having as many as 100 students to the teacher; no attempt is made to
do more than teach the children to read, write, and figure, and these subjects are
learned very imperfectly. There are six or eight industrial supervisors financed in
whole or in part by the Jeanes Fund; most of these teachers are stimulating the
Negro schools to do very good work upon the practical things of life. A few wide-awake
Negro teachers not connected with the Jeanes Fund are doing the same thing.
It can probably be truthfully said that the Negro schools are gradually improving,
but they are still just about as poor and inadequate as they can be."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Commenting on the cause of the migration, the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i>, a
prominent southern white paper, says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
While mob violence and the falsehood which has been built upon that foundation
constitutes, perhaps, a strong factor in the migration of the Negroes, there is scarcely
a doubt that the educational feature enters into it. Negroes induced to go to the
North undoubtedly believe they can secure better educational facilities there for their
children, whether they really succeed in getting them or not.
</p>

<p>
Georgia, as well as other southern states, is undoubtedly behind in the matter
of Negro education, unfair in the matter of facilities, in the quality of teachers and
instructors, and in the pay of those expected to impart proper instruction to Negro
children.
</p>

<p>
We have proceeded upon the theory that education would, in his own mind, at
least, carry the Negro beyond his sphere; that it would give him higher ideas of himself
and make of him a poorer and less satisfactory workman. That is nonsense....
</p>
</div>

<h4>
B. THE NORTH
</h4>

<p>
<i>The cessation of immigration.</i>â€”Prior to the war the yearly immigration to
the United States equaled approximately the total Negro population of the
North. Foreign labor filled the unskilled labor field, and Negroes were held
closely in domestic and personal-service work. The cessation of immigration
and the return of thousands of aliens to their mother-country, together with
the opening of new industries and the extension of old ones, created a much
greater demand for American labor. Employers looked to the South for
Negroes and advertised for them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>High wages.</i>â€”Wages for unskilled work in the North in 1916 and 1917
ranged from $3.00 to $8.00 a day. There were shorter hours of work and
opportunity for overtime and bonuses.
</p>

<p>
<i>Living conditions.</i>â€”Houses available for Negroes in the North, though
by northern standards classed as unsanitary and unfit for habitation, afforded
greater comforts than the rude cabins of the plantation. For those who had
owned homes in the South there was the opportunity of selling them and
applying the money to payment for a good home in the North.
</p>

<p>
<i>Identical school privileges.</i>â€”Co-education of whites and Negroes in northern
schools made possible a higher grade of instruction for the children of migrants.<a name='FA_16' id='FA_16' href='#FN_16' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a>
</p>

<h3>
II. SENTIMENTAL CAUSES OF THE MIGRATION
</h3>

<p>
The causes classed as sentimental include those which have reference to
the feelings of Negroes concerning their surroundings in the South and their
reactions to the social systems and practices of certain sections of the South.
Frequently these causes were given as the source of an old discontent among
Negroes concerning the South. Frequently they took prominence over
economic causes, and they were held for the most part by a fairly high class
of Negroes. These causes are in part as follows:
</p>

<p>
<i>Lack of protection from mob violence.</i>â€”Between 1885 and 1918, 2,881
Negroes were lynched in the United States, more than 85 per cent of these
lynchings occurring in the South. In 1917, 2,500 Negroes were driven by
force out of Dawson and Forsythe counties, Georgia.<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a>
</p>

<p>
The Chicago Urban League reported that numbers of migrants from towns
where lynchings had occurred registered for jobs in Chicago very shortly
after lynchings. Concerning mob violence and general insecurity both whites
and Negroes living in the South have had much to say. Their statements
at the time of the migration are here quoted.
</p>

<p>
From the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i> (white), November 24, 1916:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Current dispatches from Albany, Georgia, in the center of the section apparently
most affected, and where efforts are being made to stop the exodus by spreading
correct information among the Negroes, say:
</p>

<p>
The heaviest migration of Negroes has been from those counties in which there
have been the worst outbreaks against Negroes. It is developed by investigation that
where there have been lynchings, the Negroes have been most eager to believe what
the emigration agents have told them of plots for the removal or extermination of the
race. Comparatively few Negroes have left Dougherty County, which is considered
significant in view of the fact that this is one of the counties in southwest Georgia
in which a lynching has never occurred.
</p>

<p>
These statements are most significant. Mob law as we have known in Georgia
has furnished emigration agents with all the leverage they want; it is a foundation
upon which it is easy to build with a well concocted lie or two, and they have not
been slow to take advantage of it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This loss of her best labor is another penalty Georgia is paying for her indifference
and inactivity in suppressing mob law.
</p>
</div>

<p>
From the <i>Southwestern Christian Advocate</i> (Negro), April 26, 1917:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
But why do they [the Negroes] go? We give a concrete answer: some months
ago Anthony Crawford, a highly respectable, honest and industrious Negro, with a
good farm and holdings estimated to be worth $300,000, was lynched in Abbeville,
South Carolina. He was guilty of no crime. He would not be cheated out of his
cotton. That was insolence. He must be taught a lesson. When the mob went
for him he defended himself. They overpowered him and brutally lynched him.
This murder was without excuse and was condemned in no uncertain words by the
Governor, other high officials and the press in general of South Carolina. Officials
pledged that the lynchers would be punished. The case went to the grand jury.
Mr. Crawford was lynched in the daytime and dragged through the streets by
unmasked men. The names of the leaders were supposed to have been known, and
yet the grand jury, under oath, says that it could not find sufficient evidence to warrant
an indictment....
</p>

<p>
Is any one surprised that Negroes are leaving South Carolina by the thousands?
The wonder is that any of them remain. They will suffer in the North. Some of
them will die. But Anthony Crawford did not get a chance to die in Abbeville,
South Carolina. He was shamefully murdered. Any place would be paradise
compared with some sections of the South where the Negroes receive such maltreatment.
</p>
</div>

<p>
From the <i>Savannah</i> (Georgia) <i>Morning News</i> (white), January 3, 1917:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Another cause is the feeling of insecurity. The lack of legal protection in the
country is a constant nightmare to the colored people who are trying to accumulate
a comfortable little home and farm. There is scarcely a Negro mother in the country
who does not live in dread and fear that her husband or son may come in unfriendly
contact with some white person as to bring the lynchers or the arresting officers to
her door which may result in the wiping out of her entire family. It must be acknowledged
that this is a sad condition....
</p>

<p>
The Southern white man ought to be willing to give the Negro a man's chance
without regard to his race or color, give him at least the same protection of law given
to anyone else. If he will not do this, the Negro must seek those North or West,
who will give him better wages and better treatment. I hope, however, that this
will not be necessary.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Injustice in the courts.</i>â€”An excerpt from one of the newspapers of that
period illustrates the basis of this cause:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
While our very solvency is being sucked out from underneath we go out about
affairs as usualâ€”our police officers raid poolrooms for "loafing Negroes," bring in
twelve, keep them in the barracks all night, and next morning find that many of them
have steady, regular jobs, valuable assets to their white employers, suddenly left and
gone to Cleveland, "where they don't arrest fifty niggers for what three of 'em done"
[<i>Montgomery</i> (Alabama) <i>Advertiser</i> (white), September 21, 1916].
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Inferior transportation facilities.</i>â€”This refers to "Jim Crow cars," a partitioned
section of one railway car, usually the baggage car, and partitioned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
sections of railway waiting-rooms, poorly kept, bearing signs, "For colored
only." This dissatisfaction is expressed in part in the following comment
of a Negro presiding elder, writing in the <i>Macon</i> (Georgia) <i>Ledger</i>, a white
paper:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The petty offenses, which you mention, are far more numerous than you are
aware of, besides other unjust treatments enacted daily on the streets, street cars
and trains. Our women are inhumanly treated by some conductors, both on the street
cars and trains. White men are often found in compartments for Negroes smoking,
and if anything is said against it they who speak are insulted, or the car is purposely
filled with big puffs of smoke and the conductor's reply is, "He'll quit to-rectly."
Recently a white man entered a trailer for Negroes with two little dogs. One of the
dogs went between the seats and crouched by a woman; she pushed him from her
and the white man took both dogs and set them aside her and she was forced to ride
with them. This is one of the many, many acts of injustice which often result in a
row for which the Negro has to pay the penalty. These things are driving the Negro
from the South.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Other causes stated are (<i>a</i>) the deprivation of the right to vote, (<i>b</i>) the
"rough-handed" and unfair competition of "poor whites," (<i>c</i>) persecution by
petty officers of the law, and (<i>d</i>) the "persecution of the Press."
</p>

<h3>
III. BEGINNING AND SPREAD OF MIGRATION
</h3>

<p>
The enormous proportions to which the exodus grew obscure its beginning.
Several experiments had been tried with southern labor in the Northeast,
particularly in the Connecticut tobacco fields and in Pennsylvania. In
Connecticut, Negro students from the southern schools had been employed
during summers with great success. Early in 1916, industries in Pennsylvania
imported many Negroes from Georgia and Florida. During July one railroad
company stated that it had brought to Pennsylvania more than 13,000 Negroes.
They wrote back for their friends and families, and from the points to which
they had been brought they spread out into new and "labor slack" territories.
Once begun, this means of recruiting labor was used by hard-pressed
industries in other sections of the North. The reports of high wages, of the
unexpected welcome of the North, and of unusually good treatment accorded
Negroes spread throughout the South from Georgia and Florida to Texas.
</p>

<p>
The stimuli of suggestion and hysteria gave the migration an almost
religious significance, and it became a mass movement. Letters, rumors,
Negro newspapers, gossip, and other forms of social control operated to add
volume and enthusiasm to the exodus. Songs and poems of the period characterized
the migration as the "Flight Out of Egypt," "Bound for the Promised
Land," "Going into Canaan," "The Escape from Slavery," etc.
</p>

<p>
The first movement was from Southeast to Northeast, following main
lines of transportation. Soon, however, it became known that the Middle
West was similarly in need of men. Many industries advertised for southern
Negroes in Negro papers. The federal Department of Labor for a period was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
instrumental in transporting Negroes from the South to relieve the labor
shortage in other sections of the country, but discontinued such efforts when
southern congressmen pointed out that the South's labor supply was being
depleted. It was brought out in the East St. Louis riot inquiry that plants
there had advertised in Texas newspapers for Negro laborers.
</p>

<p>
Chicago was the logical destination of Negroes from Mississippi, Arkansas,
Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, because of the more direct railway lines, the
way in which the city had become known in these sections through its two
great mail-order houses, the Stock Yards, and the packing-plants with their
numerous storage houses scattered in various towns and cities of the South.
It was rumored in these sections that the Stock Yards needed 50,000 men;
it was said that temporary housing was being provided by these hard-pressed
industries. Many Negroes came to the city on free transportation, but by far
the greater numbers paid their own fare. Club rates offered by the railroads
brought the fare within reach of many who ordinarily could not have brought
their families or even come themselves. The organization into clubs composed
of from ten to fifty persons from the same community had the effect, on the
one hand, of adding the stimulus of intimate persuasion to the movement, and,
on the other hand, of concentrating solid groups in congested spots in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
A study of certain Negro periodicals shows a powerful influence on southern
Negroes already in a state of unsettlement over news of the "opening up of
the North."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Chicago Defender</i> became a "herald of glad tidings" to southern
Negroes. Several cities attempted to prevent its circulation among their
Negro population and confiscated the street- and store-sales supplies as fast
as they came. Negroes then relied upon subscription copies delivered through
the mails. There are reports of the clandestine circulation of copies of the
paper in bundles of merchandise. A correspondent of the <i>Defender</i> wrote:
"White people are paying more attention to the race in order to keep them in
the South, but the <i>Chicago Defender</i> has emblazoned upon their minds 'Bound
for the Promised Land.'"
</p>

<p>
In Gulfport, Mississippi, it was stated, a man was regarded "intelligent"
if he read the <i>Defender</i>, and in Laurel, Mississippi, it was said that old men
who had never known how to read, bought the paper simply because it was
regarded as precious.<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a>
</p>

Articles and headlines carrying this special appeal which appeared in the
<i>Defender</i> are quoted:

SCHOOL BOARDS BAD
</p>

<p>
While in Arkansas a member of the school board in one of the cities of that state
(and it is said it is the rule throughout the South that a Race woman teacher to hold
her school must be on friendly terms with some one of them) lived openly with a
Race woman, and the entire Race, men and women, were afraid to protest or stop
their children from going to school, because this school board member would get up
a mob and run them out of the state. They must stomach this treatment.
</p>

<p class="center">
FROZEN DEATH BETTER
</p>

<p>
To die from the bite of frost is far more glorious than that of the mob. I beg
of you, my brothers, to leave that benighted land. You are free men. Show the world
that you will not let false leaders lead you. Your neck has been in the yoke. Will
you continue to keep it there because some "white folks Nigger" wants you to?
Leave to all quarters of the globe. Get out of the South. Your being there in the
numbers you are gives the southern politician too strong a hold on your progress.
</p>

<p class="center">
TURN DEAF EAR
</p>

<p>
Turn a deaf ear to everybody. You see they are not lifting their laws to help
you, are they? Have they stopped their Jim Crow cars? Can you buy a Pullman
sleeper where you wish? Will they give you a square deal in court yet? When a
girl is sent to prison, she becomes the mistress of the guards and others in authority,
and women prisoners are put on the streets to work, something they don't do to a
white woman. And your leaders will tell you the South is the best place for you.
Turn a deaf ear to the scoundrel, and let him stay. Above all, see to it that that
jumping-jack preacher is left at the South, for he means you no good here at the North.

<p class="center">
GOOD-BYE, DIXIE LAND
</p>

<p>
<i>One of our dear southern friends</i> informs an anxious public that "the Negroes of
the North seem to fit very well into their occupations and locations, but the southern
Negro will never make a success in the North. He doesn't understand the methods
there, the people and the work are wholly unsuited to him. Give him a home in
the South where climatic conditions blend into his peculiar physical makeup, where
he is understood and can understand, and let him have a master and you have given
him the ideal home." There is the solution of the problem in a nutshell. This dear
friend thinks that under a master back of the sugar cane and cotton fields, we might
really be worth something to the world. How thoughtful to point out the way for
our stumbling feet.
</p>

<p>
Those who live in the North presumably always lived there, and, like Topsy,
they "just growed" in that section, so naturally fit well into their occupations.
There is such a difference between the white man and the black man of the South;
the former can travel to the North Pole if he chooses without being affected, the latter,
"they say" will die of a million dread diseases if he dares to leave Dixie land, and yet
the thousands who have migrated North in the past year look as well and hearty
as they ever did. Something is wrong in our friend's calculations.
</p>

<p>
We hear again and again of our "peculiar physical makeup." Is there something
radically different about us that is not found in other people? Why the constant
fear of Negro supremacy if the white brain is more active and intelligent than the
brain found in the colored man? A good lawyer never fears a poor one in a court
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
battleâ€”he knows that he has him bested from the start. The fact that we have
made good wherever and whenever given an opportunity, we admit, is a little disquieting,
but it is a way we have, and is hard to get out of. Once upon a time we
permitted other people to think for usâ€”today we are thinking and acting for ourselves,
with the result that our "friends" are getting alarmed at our progress. We'd like
to oblige these unselfish (?) souls and remain slaves in the South, but to other sections
of the country we have said, as the song goes: "I hear you calling me," and boarded
the train singing, "Good-by to Dixie-Land."

exodus:

LEAVING FOR THE NORTH
</p>

<p>
Tampa, Fla., Jan. 19.â€”J. T. King, supposed to be a race leader, is using his
wits to get on the good side of the white people by calling a meeting to urge our
people not to migrate North. King has been termed a "good nigger" by his pernicious
activity on the emigration question. Reports have been received here that all who
have gone North are at work and pleased with the splendid conditions in the North.
It is known here that in the North there is a scarcity of labor, mills and factories
are open to them. People are not paying any attention to King and are packing
and ready to travel North to the "promised land."
</p>

<p class="center">
DETERMINED TO GO NORTH
</p>

<p>
Jackson, Miss., March 23.â€”Although the white police and sheriff and others
are using every effort to intimidate the citizens from going North, even Dr. Redmond's
speech was circulated around, this has not deterred our people from leaving. Many
have walked miles to take the train for the North. There is a determination to leave
and there is no hand save death to keep them from it.

<p class="center">
THOMAS LIKES THE NORTH

<p>
J. H. Thomas, Birmingham, Ala., Brownsville Colony, has been here several
weeks and is very much pleased with the North. He is working at the Pullman
shops, making twice as much as he did at home. Mr. Thomas says the "exodus"
will be greater later on in the year, that he did not find four feet of snow or would
freeze to death. He lives at 346 East Thirty-fifth St.

LEAVING FOR THE EAST

<p>
Huntsville, Ala., Jan. 19.â€”Fifteen families, all members of the Race, left here
today for Pittsburgh, Pa., where they will take positions as butlers, and maids,
getting sixty to seventy-five dollars per month, against fifteen and twenty paid here.
Most of them claim that they have letters from their friends who went early and made
good, saying that there was plenty of work, and this field of labor is short, owing to
the vast amount of men having gone to Europe and not returned.

<i>Denunciation of the South.</i>â€”The idea that the South is a bad place, unfit
for the habitation of Negroes, was "played up" and emphasized by the <i>Defender</i>.
Conditions most distasteful to Negroes were given first prominence. In this
it had a clear field, for the local southern Negro papers dared not make such
unrestrained utterances. Articles of this type appeared:

EXODUS TO START
</p>

<p>
Forest City, Ark., Feb. 16.â€”David B. Smith (white) is on trial for life for the
brutal murder of a member of the Race, W. H. Winford, who refused to be whipped
like others. This white man had the habit of making his "slave" submit to this
sort of punishment and when Winford refused to stand for it, he was whipped to
death with a "black snake" whip. The trial of Smith is attracting very little attention.
As a matter of fact, the white people here think nothing of it as the dead man
is a "nigger."
</p>

<p>
This very act, coupled with other recent outrages that have been heaped upon
our people, are causing thousands to leave, not waiting for the great spring movement
in May.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Defender</i> had a favorite columnist, W. Allison Sweeney. His specialty
was "breaking southerners and 'white folks' niggers on the wheel." One of
his articles in the issue of June 23, 1917, was captioned: "A Chicago 'Nigger'
Preacher, a 'Feeder,' of The 'Little Hells,' Springs up to Hinder Our Brethren
Coming North."
</p>

A passage from this article will illustrate the temper of his writings. Aroused

from that bellowing ass, who, at this very moment no doubt, somewhere in the South,
is going up and down the land, telling the natives <i>why</i> they should be content, as the
<i>Tribune</i>, puts it, to become "Russianized," to remain in that landâ€”to themâ€”of
<i>blight</i>; of <i>murdered</i> kin, <i>deflowered</i> womanhood, <i>wrecked</i> homes, <i>strangled</i> ambitions,
<i>make-believe</i> schools, <i>roving</i> "gun parties," <i>midnight arrests</i>, <i>rifled</i> virginity, <i>trumped
up</i> charges, <i>lonely</i> graves, where owls hoot, and where friends dare not go! Do you
wonder at the thousands leaving the land where every foot of ground marks a tragedy,
leaving the grave of their fathers and all that is dear, to seek their fortunes in the
North? And you who say that their going is to seek better wages are insulting
truth, dethroning reason, and consoling yourself with a groundless allegation.

So much has been said through the white papers in the South about the members

Amaca was arrested for having "Bound for the Promise Land," a poem published in

<i>The "Great Northern Drive."</i>â€”The setting of definite dates was another
stimulus. The "Great Northern Drive" was scheduled to begin May 15,
1917. This date, or the week following, corresponds with the date of the
heaviest arrivals in the North, the period of greatest temporary congestion
and awakening of the North to the presence of the new arrivals. Letters to
the <i>Chicago Defender</i> and to social agencies in the North informed them of
many Negroes who were preparing to come in the "Great Drive." The following

thousands of restless Negroes to venture North, where they were assured of
its protection and championship of their cause. Many migrants in Chicago
attribute their presence in the North to the <i>Defender's</i> encouraging pictures
of relief from conditions at home with which they became increasingly dissatisfied
as they read.

<h3>
IV. THE ARRIVAL IN CHICAGO
</h3>

<p>
At the time of the migration the great majority of Negroes in Chicago
lived in a limited area on the South Side, principally between Twenty-second
and Thirty-ninth streets, Wentworth Avenue and State Street, and in scattered
groups to Cottage Grove Avenue on the east. State Street was the main
thoroughfare. Prior to the influx of southern Negroes, many houses stood
vacant in the section west of State Street, from which Negroes had moved
when better houses became available east of State Street. Into these old and
frequently almost uninhabitable houses the first newcomers moved. Because
of its proximity to the old vice area this district had an added undesirability
for old Chicagoans. The newcomers, however, were unacquainted with its
reputation and had no hesitancy about moving in until better homes could
be secured. As the number of arrivals increased, a scarcity of houses followed,
creating a problem of acute congestion.
</p>

<p>
During the summer of 1917 the Chicago Urban League made a canvass
of real estate dealers supplying houses for Negroes, and found that in a single
day there were 664 Negro applicants for houses, and only fifty houses available.
In some instances as many as ten persons were listed for a single house.
This condition did not continue long. There were counted thirty-six new neighborhoods,
formerly white, opening up to Negroes within three months.
</p>

<p>
At the same time rents increased from 5 to 30 and sometimes as much as
50 per cent. A more detailed study of living conditions among the early migrants
in Chicago was made by the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy.
The inquiry included seventy-five families of less than a year's residence.
In the group were sixty married couples, 128 children, eight women, nine
married men with families in the South. Of these migrants forty-five families
came from rural and thirty-two from urban localities. The greatest number,
twenty-nine, came from Alabama; twenty-five were from Mississippi, eleven
from Louisiana, five from Georgia, four from Arkansas, two from Tennessee,
and one from Florida. Forty-one of these seventy-five families were each
living in one room. These rooms were rented by the week, thus making possible
an easy change of home at the first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
It was at this period that the greatest excitement over the "incoming
hordes of Negroes" prevailed.
</p>

<p>
A significant feature was the large number of young children found. The
age distribution of 128 children in these seventy-five families was forty-seven
under seven years, forty-one between seven and fourteen years, and forty
over fourteen years.
</p>

<p>
Most of these children were of school age and had come from districts in
the South which provided few school facilities. The parents were unaccustomed
to the requirements of northern schools in matters of discipline, attendance,
and scholarship. Considerable difficulty was experienced by teachers, parents,
and children in these first stages of adjustment.

</p>

<h3>
V. ADJUSTMENTS TO CHICAGO LIFE
</h3>

<p>
Meeting actual conditions of life in Chicago brought its exaltations and
disillusionments to the migrants. These were reflected in the schools, public
amusement places, industry, and the street cars. The Chicago Urban League,
Negro churches, and Negro newspapers assumed the task of making the
migrants into "city folk." The increase in church membership indicates
prompt efforts to re-engage in community life and establish agreeable and
helpful associations. It also reflects the persistence of religious life among
the migrants. This increase is shown in Table V.

<p>
Adjustment to new conditions was taken up by the Urban League as its
principal work. Co-operating with the Travelers Aid Society, United Charities,
and other agencies of the city, it met the migrants at stations and, as far as
its facilities permitted, secured living quarters and jobs for them. The churches
took them into membership and attempted to make them feel at home. Negro
newspapers published instructions on dress and conduct and had great influence
in smoothing down improprieties of manner which were likely to provoke
criticism and intolerance in the city.
</p>

<p>
Individual experiences of the migrants in this period of adjustment were
often interesting. The Commission made a special effort to note these experiences
for the light they throw upon the general process. Much of the adjustment
was a double process, including the adjustment of rural southern Negroes
to northern urban conditions. It is to be remembered that over 70 per cent
of the Negro population of the South is rural. This means familiarity with
rural methods, simple machinery, and plain habits of living. Farmers and
plantation workers coming to Chicago had to learn new tasks. Skilled craftsmen
had to relearn their trades when they were thrown amid the highly
specialized processes of northern industries. Domestic servants went into
industry. Professional men who followed their clientÃ¨le had to re-establish
themselves in a new community. The small business men could not compete
with the Jewish merchants, who practically monopolized the trade of Negroes
near their residential areas, or with the "Loop" stores.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Many Negroes sold their homes and brought their furniture with them.
Reinvesting in property frequently meant a loss; the furniture brought was
often found to be unsuited to the tiny apartments or large, abandoned dwelling-houses
they were able to rent or buy.
</p>

<p>
The change of home carried with it in many cases a change of status. The
leader in a small southern community, when he came to Chicago, was immediately
absorbed into the struggling mass of unnoticed workers. School teachers,
male and female, whose positions in the South carried considerable prestige,
had to go to work in factories and plants because the disparity in educational
standards would not permit continuance of their profession in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
These illustrations in Table VI, taken from family histories, show how
adjustment led to inferior occupation.

<p>
The following experiences of one or two families from the many histories
gathered, while not entirely typical of all the migrants, contain features
common to all:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>The Thomas family.</i>â€”Mr. Thomas, his wife and two children, a girl nineteen
and a boy seventeen, came to Chicago from Seals, Alabama, in the spring of 1917.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
After a futile search, the family rented rooms for the first week. This was expensive
and inconvenient, and between working hours all sought a house into which they
could take their furniture. They finally found a five-room flat on Federal Street.
The building had been considered uninhabitable and dangerous. Three of the five
rooms were almost totally dark. The plumbing was out of order. There was no
bath, and the toilet was outside of the house. There was neither electricity nor gas,
and the family used oil lamps. The rent was $15 per month. Although the combined
income of the family could easily have made possible a better house, they could find
none.
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas were farmers in the South. On the farm Mrs. Thomas
did the work of a man along with her husband. Both are illiterate. The daughter
had reached the fourth grade and the boy the fifth grade in school. At home they
belonged to a church and various fraternal orders and took part in rural community life.
</p>

<p>
On their arrival in Chicago they were short of funds. Father and son went to
work at the Stock Yards. Although they had good jobs they found their income
insufficient; the girl went to work in a laundry, and the mother worked as a laundress
through the first winter for $1 a day. She later discovered that she was working for
half the regular rate for laundry work. Soon she went back to housekeeping to reduce
the food bill.
</p>

<p>
All the family were timid and self-conscious and for a long time avoided contacts,
thus depriving themselves of helpful suggestions. The children became ashamed of
the manners of their parents and worked diligently to correct their manner of speech.
The children attended Wendell Phillips night school in the hope of improving their
community status.
</p>

<p>
The freedom and independence of Negroes in the North have been a constant
novelty to them and many times they have been surprised that they were "not
noticed enough to be mistreated." They have tried out various amusement places,
parks, ice-cream parlors, and theaters near their home on the South Side and have
enjoyed them because they were denied these opportunities in their former home.
</p>

<p>
The combined income of this family is $65 a week, and their rent is now low.
Many of their old habits have been preserved because of the isolation in which they
have lived and because they have not been able to move into better housing.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Jones family.</i>â€”Mr. Jones, his wife, a six-year-old son, and a nephew aged
twenty-one, came from Texas early in 1919. Although they arrived after the heaviest
migration, they experienced the same difficulties as earlier comers.
</p>

<p>
They searched for weeks for a suitable house. At first they secured one room
on the South Side in a rooming-house, where they were obliged to provide gas, coal,
linen, bedding, and part of the furniture. After a few weeks they got two rooms for
light housekeeping, for $10 a month. The associations as well as the physical condition
of the house were intolerable. They then rented a flat on Carroll Avenue in
another section. The building was old and run down. The agent for the property,
to induce tenants to occupy it, had promised to clean and decorate it, but failed
to keep his word. When the Jones family asked the owner to make repairs, he refused
flatly and was exceedingly abusive.
</p>

<p>
Finally Jones located a house on the West Side that was much too large for his
family, and the rent too high. They were forced to take lodgers to aid in paying the
rent. This was against the desire of Mrs. Jones, who did not like to have strangers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
in her house. The house has six rooms and bath and is in a state of dilapidation.
Mr. Jones has been forced to cover the holes in the floor with tin to keep out the rats.
The plumbing is bad. During the winter there is no running water, and the agent
for the building refuses to clean more than three rooms or to furnish screens or storm
doors or to pay for any plumbing. In the back yard under the house is an accumulation
of ashes, tin cans, and garbage left by a long series of previous tenants. There
is no alley back of the house, and all of the garbage from the back yard must be carried
out through the front. Jones made a complaint about insanitary conditions to the
Health Department, and the house was inspected, but so far nothing has been done.
It was difficult to induce the agent to supply garbage cans.
</p>

<p>
Jones had reached the eighth grade, and Mrs. Jones had completed the first
year of high school. The nephew had finished public-school grades provided in his
home town and had been taught the boiler trade. He is now pursuing this trade
in hope of securing sufficient funds to complete his course in Conroe College, where
he has already finished the first year. The boy of six was placed in a West Side
school. He was removed from this school, however, and sent back south to live
with Mrs. Jones's mother and attend school there. Mrs. Jones thought that the
influence of the school children of Chicago was not good for him. He had been almost
blinded by a blow from a baseball bat in the hands of one of several older boys who
continually annoyed him. The child had also learned vulgar language from his
school associates.
</p>

<p>
The Jones family were leading citizens in their southern home. They were
members of a Baptist church, local clubs, and a missionary society, while Jones was
a member and officer in the Knights of Tabor, Masons, and Odd Fellows. They
owned their home and two other pieces of property in the same town, one of which
brought in $20 a month. As a boiler-maker, he earned about $50 a week, which is
about the same as his present income. Their motive in coming to Chicago was to
escape from the undesirable practices and customs of the South.
</p>

<p>
They had been told that no discrimination was practiced against Negroes in
Chicago; that they could go where they pleased without the embarrassment or hindrance
because of their color. Accordingly, when they first came to Chicago, they
went into drug-stores and restaurants. They were refused service in numbers of
restaurants and at the refreshment counters in some drug-stores. The family has
begun the re-establishment of its community life, having joined a West Side Baptist
church and taking an active interest in local organizations, particularly the Wendell
Phillips Social Settlement. The greatest satisfaction of the Joneses comes from the
"escape from Jim Crow conditions and segregation" and the securing of improved
conditions of work, although there is no difference in the wages.

<h3>
VI. MIGRANTS IN CHICAGO
</h3>

<p>
Migrants have been visited in their homes, and met in industry, in the
schools, and in contacts on street cars and in parks. Efforts have been made
to learn why they came to Chicago and with what success they were adjusting
themselves to their new surroundings.

nothing but a mud hole. I sure wished I was back home.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. When I got here and got on the street cars and saw colored people sitting
by white people all over the car I just held my breath, for I thought any
minute they would start something, then I saw nobody noticed it, and I just
thought this was a real place for colored people. No, indeed, I'll never
work in anybody's kitchen but my own, any more, that's the one thing that
makes me stick to this job.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. Was completely lost, friend was to meet me but didn't and I was afraid to
ask anyone where to go; finally my friend came; was afraid to sleep first
nightâ€”so much noise; thought the cars would finally stop running so I
could rest.

<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: In what respects is life harder or easier here than in the South?

<p class="tdh">
1. Easier. I don't have to work so hard and get more money.

<h3>
VII. EFFORTS TO CHECK MIGRATION
</h3>

<p>
The withdrawal of great numbers of Negroes, both because of the migration
and because of military service, left large gaps in the industries of the South
dependent upon Negro labor. Thousands of acres of rice and sugar cane
went to waste. The turpentine industry of the Carolinas and the milling
interests of Tennessee were hard pressed for labor. Cotton-growing was
much affected, especially in the delta region of Mississippi. The situation
became critical, presenting a real economic problem. Organized efforts were
made, and at times extreme measures were taken, to start a return movement.
A report was circulated that on one day in the winter of 1919 in Chicago,
17,000 Negroes were counted in a bread line. The "horrors of northern
winters" were played up as they had been during the migration.
</p>

<p>
The press throughout the country was used to spread broadcast the
South's needs, its kind treatment of Negroes, its opportunities, and its growing
change of heart on the question of race relations. Newspaper articles from
sections of the North and South carried about the same story. The <i>Chicago
Tribune</i> said in a conspicuous headline: "Louisiana Wants Negroes to Return."
Other such headlines were: <i>Washington Post</i>â€”"South Needs Negroes. Try
to Get Labor for Their Cotton Fields. Tell of Kind Treatment"; <i>New York
Evening Sun</i>â€”"To Aid Negro Return"; <i>Philadelphia Press</i>â€”"South Is
Urging Negroes to Return. Many Districts Willing to Pay Fare of Those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
Who Come Back"; <i>Memphis Commercial Appeal</i>â€”"South Is Best for Negro,
Say Mississippians. Colored People Found Prosperous and Happy."
</p>

<p>
Though such reports were widely circulated throughout the North, the
actual efforts of agencies from the South seeking the return of Negro labor
centered around Chicago. This was due largely to the fact that from the
southern states most acutely in need the drift during the migration had been
to Chicago, and because the increase of Chicago's Negro population had been
so great.
</p>

<p>
Immediately following the riots in Chicago and Washington, rumors
gained wide currency that hundreds of migrants were leaving for sections of
the South. So strong was the belief in the truth of this report that a Chicago
newspaper telegraphed the governors of southern states inquiring the number
of Negroes they needed. Agents of the South, including representatives of
the Tennessee Association of Commerce, the Department of Immigration of
Louisiana, the Mississippi Welfare League, and the Southern Alluvial Land
Association, visited northern cities with a view to providing means for the
return of Negroes. Although free transportation was offered, together with
promises of increased wages and better living conditions, the various commissions
were disappointed.
</p>

<p>
Their interviews with Negroes living in Chicago revealed a determination
not to return to conditions they had left two years before. To offset
this objection, two Chicago Negroes and one white man were taken to
Mississippi by a representative of the Mississippi Welfare League to make an
investigation. They visited several delta towns, traveling for the most part
in automobiles and interviewing farmers and laborers. They reported in
substance as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Railroad accommodations for Negroes were adequate and uniform, irrespective
of locality; treatment accorded Negro passengers by railroad officials was courteous
throughout. Public-school terms were nine months in the city and eight months
in the country for white and colored alike, and the strongest possible human ties
between planter and worker exist.... In no instance were Negroes not given the
freest use of sidewalks, streets, and thoroughfares and we were unable to find any
trace of friction of any kind between the races.
</p>
</div>

<p>
An effort was then made by the Chicago Urban League to ascertain the
precise state of affairs. Its southern representative questioned hundreds of
Negroes living in the South, regarding improved relationships. Answers to
this query were all about the same. Some of them are quoted:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There has been no change. Lincoln League organized in this city has been
denounced by the white newspapers as a movement that will cause trouble, and the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Urban Leagues
of various cities have been called "strife breeders and meddlers in southern affairs";
Jim Crow accommodations are just the same as ever. If there is any change for the
better, I can't see it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It is ridiculous for any Negro to say he finds conditions better here. Don't
you remember that Negroes answering an invitation to meet the Welfare Committee
of white men not long ago were told as soon as they got into the meeting place that
the Committee was ready to hear what Negroes wanted, but that the question of the
Negro's right to exercise the right of voting would not be allowed to be discussed at
all, and that that must be agreed to before any discussion whatever would be entertained,
and that the Negroes left the meeting place without a chance to demand the
one thing they wished to enjoy?
</p>

<p class="p2">
Some deceitful, lying Negro may say that times are better, but he would, at the
same time, know that he was not telling the truth. Haven't you been hearing more
reports of lynching of Negroes than you ever did in your life, since the war? Where,
then, is there any improvement? Ain't all the judges, all the police and constables,
all the juries as white man as ever? Does the word of a Negro count for more now
than it did before the war? Don't white men insult our wives and daughters and
sisters and get off at it, unless we take the law into our own hand and punish them
for it ourselves, and get lynched for protecting our own, just as often as ever? How
much more schooling from public funds do our children get now than they got before
the war? How much more do we have to say now than we had to say before the war
about the way the taxes we pay shall be spent for schools, or for salaries, or for anything
connected with administration and government? Why, even the colored man in
Caddo parish who subscribed for $100,000 in Liberty bonds and bought lots of War
Savings stamps, and others who bought less, but in the hundreds, and thousands of
the bonds and War Saving stamps, have no more to say about affairs now than they
ever had. Where is the improvement?
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Urban League also made an inquiry into the numbers of Negroes leaving
and arriving in the week following the riot, and when the strongest efforts
were being made to induce a return of migrants. During this period 261
Negroes came to Chicago and 219 left the city. Of the 219 leaving, eighty-three
gave some southern state as their destination. For the most part, they
were persons returning from vacations in the North, and Chicago Negroes
going South to visit or on business. Some were rejoining their families.
Fourteen were leaving because of the riot. None, however, indicated any
intention of going South to work.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that migrant Negroes are not returning South. On the contrary,
there is a small but continuous stream of migration to the industrial centers
of the North. No great number of Negroes returned to the South even during
the trying unemployment period in the early part of 1921. Census figures
for Chicago for 1920 show a number much smaller than the usual estimates
of the size of the Negro population during the period of the heaviest migration.
This may be accounted for by the fact that Chicago has been used as a
re-routing point to other northern cities. The decrease from 1918 undoubtedly
means that some returned to the South, but it is apparent that the great
majority of the migrants remain, despite the hardships attending shortage of
work.

CHAPTER IV
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE NEGRO POPULATION OF CHICAGO</span>
</h2>

<h3>
A. DISTRIBUTION AND DENSITY
</h3>

<p>
The Negro population of Chicago, as reported by the Federal Bureau of
the Census, was 44,103 in 1910 and 109,594 in 1920. The increase during the
decade was therefore 65,491, or 148.5 per cent. Negroes constituted 2 per
cent of the city's total population in 1910 and 4.1 per cent in 1920. The
increase in the white population during the decade was 450,047, or 21 per cent,
bringing the white population up to 2,589,104 in 1920. The remainder of
the population consisted of 3,007 Chinese, Japanese, and Indians, of whom
there were 2,123 in 1910. Chicago's total population in 1920 was 2,701,705.
</p>

<p>
In order to indicate where the Negro population of the city lived in 1910
and in 1920, the Commission sought the co-operation of the Census Bureau.
On the basis of a rough preliminary survey, certain areas in which it was
evident that the main groups of Negroes lived were delimited, and liberal
margins allowed to include scattered residents living near the main areas.
For these areas the Census Bureau supplied figures showing the total and
Negro population by census-enumeration districts. Since each enumeration
district embraced from one or two to six city blocks in the more crowded
portions of the city, the data thus made available enabled the Commission
to prepare maps showing with a fair degree of accuracy where Negroes in
Chicago lived in 1910 and in 1920, and also their proportion to the total
population in these units of area.
</p>

<p>
The 510 enumeration districts covered for 1910 included 40,739, or 92.3
per cent of the 44,103 Negroes reported by the Census Bureau for that year;
and the 730 enumeration districts covered for 1920 included 106,089, or 96.8
per cent of the 109,594 Negroes reported for that year. The small remaining
number of Negroes scattered throughout the parts of the city not embraced
in these areas in 1910 and 1920 included many janitors living in the buildings
where they worked, and others employed in private homes and living on the
premises, thus making their presence inconspicuous among white residents.
The areas in which 40,739 Negroes were living in 1910 contained a total population
of 657,044, the Negroes thus constituting 6.2 per cent of the total. The
areas in which 106,089 Negroes lived in 1920 contained a total population of
779,279, the Negroes thus constituting about 13 per cent of the total.
</p>

<p>
The outstanding fact concerning these data for 1910 and 1920 is that the
large increase in Negro population did not bring into existence any new large
colonies but resulted in the expansion and increased density of areas in which
groups of Negroes already lived in 1910.

By far the largest number of Negroes in 1910 and 1920 lived in what may

<h3>
B. NEIGHBORHOODS OF NEGRO RESIDENCE
</h3>

<p>
While the principal colony of Chicago's Negro population is situated in a
central part of the South Side, Negroes are to be found in several other parts
of the city in proportions to total population ranging from less than 1 per cent
to more than 95 per cent. In some of these neighborhoods whites and Negroes
have become adjusted to one another; in others they have not. There are
numerous degrees of variation between the two extremes. In this study the
term "adjusted neighborhood" indicates one in which whites and Negroes
have become accommodated to each other, and friction is either non-existent
or negligible; "non-adjusted neighborhood" is one where misunderstandings,
dislikes, and antagonisms resulting from contacts of any degree between whites
and Negroes express themselves in racial hostility, sometimes involving open
clashes.
</p>

<h4>
I. ADJUSTED NEIGHBORHOODS
</h4>

<h5>
1. THE SOUTH SIDE
</h5>

<p>
The most striking example of "adjusted neighborhoods" is the district
known as the "Black Belt." Because 90 per cent of the Negroes of Chicago
live within this area, it is usually assumed that the district is 90 per cent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
Negro. This, however, is not the case. The area between Twelfth and
Thirty-ninth streets, Wentworth Avenue and Lake Michigan, includes the
oldest and densest Negro population of any section of its size in Chicago.
However, the actual numbers of whites and Negroes living there are 42,797
and 54,906 respectively. In this area the Negro population has increased
gradually and without disturbance for many years. Although for a long period
Negroes were confined to the area bounded by State Street, Wentworth
Avenue, Twelfth, and Thirty-ninth streets, their movement into the neighborhood
east of State Street was ultimately looked upon as a natural and expected
expansion. Within the whole of this territory a relationship exists, which,
although perhaps not uniformly friendly, yet is without friction or disorder.
During the riot few white persons living or engaged in business there were attacked
by Negroes, who were in the majority in many parts of the area. Many
whites remaining in the area, which was formerly all white, are small property
owners who for sentimental reasons prefer to live there. Numbers of family
hotels and large apartment houses there continue to be occupied by whites,
who are apparently little affected by the presence of 10 per cent more Negroes
than whites around them. Michigan Avenue and Grand Boulevard are the
streets into which Negroes have moved most recently. The only recorded
bombing within this area occurred on Grand Boulevard. The Grand Boulevard
district is affiliated with the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners'
Association. Although the bombing was an expression of resentment against
Negroes because they moved into this block, there are circumstances which
indicate that the resentment did not come from the neighbors. For example,
the wife of a Negro physician owning and living in a house in the same block
was asked by her white neighbors to serve as chairman of a committee to keep
up the property in the neighborhood.
</p>

<p class="caption">RACIAL CONTACTS AMONG CHILDREN IN AN ADJUSTED NEIGHBORHOOD</p>
</div>

<p>
The first Negro family to move into the Vernon Avenue block immediately
south of Thirty-first Street bought its residence in 1911. It was five years
before another Negro family came. White neighbors, who were and are very
friendly, said this family's good care of its lawn was an example for the whole
block.
</p>

<p>
When an apartment house in which a Negro family lived on South Park
Avenue near Thirty-first Street was burned, white neighbors took them into
their home and kept them until another house was secured. At a meeting of
the City Club of Chicago a white man who had lived in this area for forty
years thus characterized the relations between whites and Negroes living there:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Having lived on the South Side in what is now known as the "Black Belt" for
forty years, I can testify that I have never had more honest, quiet, and law-abiding
neighbors than those who are of the African race, either full or mixed blood. In
the precinct where I live we have several families blessed with many orderly and
well-behaved children, of Caucasian and African blood. They seem to get along
nicely, and why should they not?... There is no race question, it is a question
of intelligence and morality, pure and simple.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Occasional minor misunderstandings have resulted from contacts in this
area, but they have not been conspicuously marked by racial bitterness.
Objections, sometimes expressed when the tradition of an "all white" neighborhood
was first broken, disappeared as the neighbors came to know each other.
Long residence is apparently one condition of the adjustment process.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Expansion and adjustment.</i>â€”The first noticeable expansion of the Negro
population following the migration in 1917 and 1918 was in the area extending
south from Thirty-ninth Street to Forty-seventh Street on Langley, St. Lawrence,
and Evans avenues. Negroes began moving into this area early in 1917,
first a few and finally in large numbers. There is yet no compact group, for
these Negro families, while numerous, are well distributed. The experiences
of some of the first families there are interesting.
</p>

<p>
A Negro woman bought a piece of property on Langley Avenue, near
Forty-third Street, when every other family in the block was white. The
courtesy shown her by them was all that could be desired, she declares. There
are still six or eight white families in the block, and they continue on the most
friendly terms with her. A Negro woman in another block has white neighbors
all around her, but there has been no racial objection or friction. Another,
who owns her property on Evans Avenue, has had no trouble with white families
that remain in the block. So with a Negro who rents from the Negro owner of
a flat on East Thirty-sixth Street. A Negro who has bought a home on St.
Lawrence Avenue near Forty-seventh Street declares that the white families
living thereabouts "treat my family right." In one block on St. Lawrence
Avenue a Negro family is surrounded by white neighbors, but no trouble has
been experienced. In a block on Langley Avenue another family of Negroes has
had no clashes with the white neighbors who compose most of the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
A woman who built her home in the 4800 block on Champlain Avenue, when
hers was the only Negro family there and has lived there ever since, had no
trouble with neighbors until other Negroes moved in. Then a white woman
circulated a petition for the purpose of compelling the Negroes to move out.
This effort failed. In another block on East Forty-sixth Street a Negro family
lives in a neighborhood which has a majority of whites, but the relations have
been amicable. An apartment house on Champlain Avenue near Forty-sixth
Street is occupied entirely by Negroes, though there are white families all
through the neighborhood. One Negro who has lived there for three years
says they have never been molested. A pioneer Negro family in a white block
on Vernon Avenue near Thirty-ninth Street reports no trouble with the white
neighbors.
</p>

<p class="caption">DISTRIBUTION OF
NEGRO POPULATION
1920<br />
<span class="s08">DATA OBTAINED FROM FEDERAL CENSUS</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Two women who were among the last of the whites to leave the Langley
Avenue vicinity say they always found the Negroes to be kindly neighbors. A
Negro family on Forty-first Street has been there a year without friction with
white neighbors. In another block on East Forty-second Street a Negro woman
reported that, though there are white people all through the neighborhood,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
the two races get along peaceably. In the 400 block of East Forty-sixth
Street a similar report is given. In still another block on Champlain Avenue
lives a woman who has been in the midst of white families for a number of
years without experiencing animosity. On East Forty-second Street a Negro
family has lived for three years in similar freedom from racial friction.
</p>

<p>
In another instance a pioneer Negro family in a block otherwise wholly
white was well regarded by all except one of the neighbors. This white man
who voiced loudly his objections to the "invasion" was one who, because of
his drunken habits and troublesome nature, had long been considered an
undesirable neighbor by other whites in the block.
</p>

<p>
<i>Woodlawn.</i>â€”Relations in Woodlawn, where the Negro population increase
has been relatively large, are for the most part friendly. There is an association
of Negro property owners interested in keeping up the physical appearance
of their homes in the neighborhood. No clashes have been reported except
one instance of a group of white boys from another neighborhood throwing
stones at a building where they saw Negroes. Following the stirring up and
organization of anti-Negro sentiment in Hyde Park, an attempt was made to
organize white Woodlawn property owners against the invasion of the district
by Negroes. This organization was not a great success. There have been no
bombings in this district, and no concerted opposition to the presence of Negroes
as neighbors. Long residence together and the good character and conduct
of both Negroes and whites are probably important reasons for lack of friction.
</p>

<h5>
2. THE WEST SIDE
</h5>

<p>
A situation like that in the adjusted neighborhoods of the South Side
exists in the district bounded by Washington and Kinzie, Ashland and California
avenues, where there has been a settlement of Negroes for many years.
Houses are cheaper than on the South Side, and although the general standard
of workingmen's homes compares favorably with that on the South Side,
few of the abandoned good residences formerly occupied by wealthy persons
are available for Negroes. The densest and oldest settlement of Negroes is
within the boundaries named, although the Negro residence area actually
extends many blocks beyond them on all sides. There has been little friction,
though the area has 9,221 whites and 6,520 Negroes. South of Washington
Boulevard occasional difficulties have been met by the incoming Negro population,
similar to those found in areas where the most congested Negro population
on the South Side is spreading. On the West Side no bombings have occurred,
although there have been frequent protests against the expansion. Some
streets have come to be recognized as Negro streets.
</p>

<p>
In recent years many Negroes have bought homes on the West Side when
they could not easily find living quarters in or near the older Negro residence
areas on the South Side. Almost uniformly they keep their homes in good
condition, which cannot be said of all the Negroes who settled early in this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
district. West Side Negroes, laborers for the most part, are generally home-loving,
hard-working, and desirous of improving conditions for their children.
Older settlers among them have been able to make their adjustments without
great difficulty and with no marked antagonism from white neighbors.
</p>

<p>
Though occasionally trivial conflicts arise between Negro and white neighbors,
the attitude of whites in nearby areas is customarily friendly if not cordial.
For example, a Negro doctor has a considerable practice among nearby Italians
in the vicinity of the Chicago Commons Social Settlement. At Chicago
Commons itself no distinction is made with respect to the few Negro families
which at times make use of the facilities. Children of these families have
entered classes and clubs, and one of them became a leader of a group.
</p>

<p>
The Poles who mainly occupy the neighborhood around the Northwestern
University Social Settlement are entirely friendly to Negroes. Three years ago
an educated Negro was at the head of the boys' department of the settlement,
and, with one exception, no one in that position has made more friends among
the boys and their families.
</p>

<p>
On the West Side, as on the South and North sides, Negroes have established
their own restaurants and barber shops and some groceries and delicatessen
stores. There are several theaters whose patronage is largely Negro.
</p>

<h5>
3. THE NORTH SIDE
</h5>

<p>
On the North Side, Negroes live among foreign whites and near a residence
area of wealthy Chicagoans. Their first appearance occasioned little notice
or objection, since they were generally house servants living near their work.
The largest numbers are to be found between Chicago Avenue and Division
Street on North Wells, Franklin, and cross streets connecting them.
</p>

<p>
This neighborhood has experienced several complete changes in population.
It was first occupied by Irish, then by Swedes, then by Italians. The present
neighbors of Negroes are Italians. As indicated by the population changes,
the neighborhood is old and run down, and the reasons given by Negroes for
living there are low rents and proximity to the manufacturing plants where
they work.
</p>

<p>
The Negroes there are renters, because the property, although undesirable
for residence purposes, is valuable for business and too expensive for them to
buy. The families are chiefly respectable, hard-working people. They have
their own barber and tailor shops and similar business places. In social affairs
they confine themselves largely to meetings, dances, and similar gatherings
held exclusively for their own race. Formerly the second floor of a building
on Division Street was frequently rented by the Negroes for church and other
meetings, and dances. Recently they have found other meeting places,
particularly for religious devotions. Some of their social gatherings and meetings
take place at Seward Park.
</p>

<p class="caption">CHILDREN AT WORK IN A COMMUNITY GARDEN</p>
</div>

<p>
They are welcomed not only in Seward Park, one of the city's recreation
centers, but in the settlements. At Eli Bates House, 621 West Elm Street,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
for example, there has been a club of Negro young men, and applications
have been received for admission of Negro children to some classes. The
head resident of the settlement reports, however, that it has not had much
contact with the Negro group. A few Negro children come to the kindergarten;
a group of Negro boys makes use of the gymnasium, and some neighboring
Negro families have asked settlement residents for advice.
</p>

<p>
In this neighborhood friendly relations exist between the Sicilians, who
predominate, and their Negro neighbors. Some Negroes live harmoniously
in the same tenements with the Sicilians. Their children play together, and
some Negro children have learned Sicilian phrases, so that they are able to
deal with the Sicilian shopkeepers.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere on the North Side the feeling between Italians and Negroes is
not so cordial. During the riot of 1919, serious trouble was averted on the
North Side through prompt and effective efforts by the police and members
of the community. It was reported throughout the district that automobiles
loaded with armed Negroes were on their way from the South Side to "shoot
up the North Side." The Italians immediately armed themselves and began
to shoot recklessly. They were eventually quieted by the police and others,
and there was no retaliation of the Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Many Negroes who have purchased homes and lived on the North Side for
years report little opposition. One family on North Wells Street has lived
there since 1888 and now owns several valuable pieces of property. The man
had no trouble in buying property, and the whites have always been friendly
to them and to all Negroes in that section. Another Negro family on North
Wells Street, where Negroes first lived, had no difficulty in getting their flat
sixteen years ago. This block is occupied by whites and Negroes without friction.
</p>

<p>
Minor expressions of antagonism attended the moving in of some Negro
families, but after several months the white neighbors accepted them and
now are on good terms with them.
</p>

<h4>
II. NON-ADJUSTED NEIGHBORHOODS
</h4>

<p>
Failure of adjustment between whites and Negroes has greatly accentuated
the difficulties of the housing problem for Negroes. When a general shortage
of housing is relieved there may still be a serious shortage for Negroes because
of the hostility of white neighborhoods. The sentiment for "all-white"
neighborhoods has grown with the increase in Negro population and the
threatened occupancy in small or large degree by Negroes. These non-adjusted
neighborhoods fall into distinct classes:
</p>

<p>
1. Neighborhoods of unorganized opposition. These are neighborhoods
where few Negroes live. Though contiguous they are sharply separated
from areas of Negro residence and are definitely hostile to Negroes, even those
passing through the neighborhood going to and from work, but the hostility
in them is unorganized.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
</p>

<p>
2. Neighborhoods of organized opposition. (<i>a</i>) Neighborhoods in which
no Negroes live but which are in the line of Negro expansion. Opposition
to threatened invasion has been strong. As yet they are exclusively white,
and every effort is being made to keep them so. They are illustratively
treated here as "exclusive neighborhoods." (<i>b</i>) Neighborhoods in which the
presence of Negro residents is hotly contested, by organized and unorganized
efforts to oust them. These for convenience are termed "contested neighborhoods."
</p>

<h5>
1. NEIGHBORHOODS OF UNORGANIZED OPPOSITION
</h5>

<p>
In Certain West Side neighborhoods white property owners objected to
the expansion of the principal Negro residence area of that section.
</p>

<p>
The pastor of the Negro Presbyterian Church on Washington Boulevard,
who came to Chicago in 1919, bought the houses at 2006 and 2008 Washington
Boulevard, in which white people had formerly lived. He moved into one of
them in May, 1919, and both he and his tenants in the other house received
warning letters advising them to move or take the consequences. The last of
these was received during the riot in July, 1919. No attention was paid to them.
</p>

<p>
During the riots little trouble was experienced by the Negroes in the
West Side district, who generally remained in their own houses and neighborhoods.
Some became involved in clashes on their way to or from work, but
there was no serious clash.
</p>

<p>
The district west of Cottage Grove Avenue and south to Sixty-third
Street in Woodlawn is rather sparsely built up, most of the buildings being
one- and two-family houses. Numbers of white people in the neighborhood
believe that the district has been blighted because of the occasional presence
of Negroes.
</p>

<p>
On the North Side some hostility to Negroes was shown during the 1919
riot. One Negro, who had lived on North Franklin Street for five years and
in Chicago for thirty years, told of having been spit at by rowdy Italians,
and on another occasion threatened with shooting by young roughs in a
passing automobile. White neighbors, however, intervened. Under pressure
of the riot excitement, some Italian children pushed through windows and doors
pictures of skulls and coffins inked in red. At the time of the riot Eli Bates
House issued a circular deploring race hatred and appealing for order and
fairness.
</p>

<p>
Although the few Negroes living in the Lake Park Avenue area<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19' href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> have
experienced little opposition in their present homes, there has been no Negro
expansion there. The colony, has in fact, dwindled in size since 1910. It is
made up largely of Negroes who were house servants for white families near-by
or worked in the hotels of the district.
</p>

<p>
Negroes of this colony are barred from all white restaurants in the district
except one place conducted by a Greek. In three of the motion-picture houses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
they are not allowed to sit in the best seats. In one of these theaters a sign
reads, "We reserve the right to seat our patrons to suit ourselves." Negroes
are permitted in the balcony or in the rear seats of the main floor.
</p>

<p>
On Langley, St. Lawrence, and adjoining streets south of Fifty-fifth Street
there is considerable friction resulting from the presence of Negroes.
</p>

<p>
There are residence districts of Chicago adjacent to those occupied by
Negroes in which hostility to Negroes is so marked that the latter not only
find it impossible to live there, but expose themselves to danger even by passing
through. There are no hostile organizations in these neighborhoods, and active
antagonism is usually confined to gang lawlessness. Such a neighborhood is that
west of Wentworth Avenue, extending roughly from Twenty-second to Sixty-third
streets. The number of Negroes living there is small, and most of them
live on Ada, Aberdeen, and Loomis streets, south of Fifty-seventh Street.
In the section immediately west of Wentworth Avenue and thus adjoining the
densest Negro residence area in the city, practically no Negroes live. In
addition to intense hostility, there is a lack of desirable houses. Wentworth
Avenue has long been regarded as a strict boundary line separating white and
Negro residence areas. The district has many "athletic clubs."<a name='FA_20' id='FA_20' href='#FN_20' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> The contact
of Negroes and whites comes when Negroes must pass to and from their work
at the Stock Yards and at other industries located in the district. It was
in this district that the largest number of riot clashes occurred.<a name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a> Several
Negroes have been murdered here, and numbers have been beaten by gangs
of young men and boys. A white man was killed by one of two Negroes
returning from work in that district, who declared that they had been intimidated
by the slain man. Speaking of this district, the principal of the Raymond
School, a branch of which is located west of Wentworth Avenue, said that
antagonism of the district against Negroes appeared to have been handed
down through tradition. He said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

We get a good deal of the gang spirit in the new school on the other side of Wentworth
Avenue. There seems to be an inherited antagonism. Wentworth Avenue
is the gang line. They seem to feel that to trespass on either side of that line is
ground for trouble. While colored pupils who come to the school for manual training
are not troubled in the school, they have to be escorted over the line, not because of
trouble from members of the school, but groups of boys outside the school. To give
another illustration, we took a little kindergarten group over to the park. One
little six-year-old girl was struck in the face by a man. A policeman chased but
failed to catch him. The condition is a tradition. It is handed down.
</p>
</div>

<h5>
2. NEIGHBORHOODS OF ORGANIZED OPPOSITION
</h5>

<p>
"<i>Exclusive neighborhoods.</i>"â€”In neighborhoods which are exclusive on the
basis of social class, whose restrictions apply to Negroes and the majority
of whites alike, the high price of property is a sufficient barrier against Negroes;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
it is in the neighborhoods where property values are within the means of Negroes
that fears of invasion are entertained. In many new real estate subdivisions
houses are sold on easy payments. Almost without exception these sections
are exclusively for whites, and usually it is so stated in the prospectus. Other
sections longer established come to notice when some incident provokes the
expression of opposition already organized and awaiting it.
</p>

<p>
Such a section is the neighborhood known as Park Manor and Wakeford.
This neighborhood lies between Sixty-ninth and Seventy-ninth streets, and
Cottage Grove and Indiana avenues. It is newly built, chiefly with small
dwellings, most of them not more than five years old. Many of the residents
had lived in a neighborhood to the north, nearer Woodlawn, whose growth of
Negro population had caused some of them to move. Park Manor and
Wakeford were startled by the following advertisement in the <i>Chicago Daily
News</i> in July, 1920:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
For saleâ€”Colored Attention: homes on Vernon, South Park and Indiana Aves.
Sold on easy terms; come out and look this locality over; Protestant neighborhood,
Park Manor and Wakeford; good transportation. Blair, 7455 Cottage Grove
Avenue.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Blair, a real estate agent, denied all knowledge of the advertisement and
attributed it either to an enemy or to a practical joker. He sent notices to be
read the following day in the nine churches of the district, so stating, deploring
the occurrence and pledging himself to aid the other residents in excluding
Negroes and in hunting down the author of the advertisement.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the entire district had been aroused, and a meeting called for
the evening of July 12, in front of a church at Seventy-sixth Street and St.
Lawrence Avenue. About 1,000 people gathered for this meeting, which was
conducted by the presidents of the South Park Manor and Wakeford Improvement
Associations. The former announced that he had visited the <i>Daily
News</i> and learned that the advertisement had been handed to a clerk in typewritten
form and with a typewritten signature, and paid for in advance,
whereas Blair's regular advertising was done on a charge account. This and
other information tended to show that the agent was not responsible for the
advertisement. In its issue of Monday, July 12, the <i>Daily News</i> printed an
explanatory statement.
</p>

<p>
Other speakers at the meeting were a real estate dealer and an alderman.
Considerable indignation was expressed over the false light in which the
community had been placed. Even the suggestion that Negroes might by
chance become a part of this community seemed to be abhorrent. As far as
Negroes were concerned there was no excitement, but they resented being
used to frighten white residents.

"<i>Contested neighborhoods.</i>"â€”The contested neighborhoods are by far the
most important among the types of non-adjusted neighborhoods, both because
of the actual presence in them of varying numbers of Negroes and their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
bearing on the future relations of the races. The efforts in such neighborhoods
to keep out Negroes involve stimulation of anti-Negro sentiment and organization
of property owners, and the campaign against the presence of Negroes
as neighbors develops into a campaign against Negroes. Negroes in turn
resent both the propaganda statements and the organized efforts. A continuous
struggle, marked by bombings, foreclosures of mortgages, and court disputes,
is the result.
</p>

<p>
The most conspicuous type of a "contested neighborhood" is that known
as Kenwood and Hyde Park. In this general neighborhood, from Thirty-ninth
to Fifty-ninth streets and from State Street to Lake Michigan, hostility
toward Negroes has been plainly and even forcibly expressed through organized
efforts to oust them and prevent their further encroachment. The situation
is peculiar. This is the part of the old South Side in which most of the Negro
population of Chicago has settled. The so-called "Black Belt" has been
overcrowded for years. Old and deteriorated housing and its insufficiency have
been steadily driving Negroes out of it in search of other homes.
</p>

<p>
It was inevitable that the great influx of migrants should overflow into
surrounding territory. Many migrants brought funds, having sold out their
homes and other possessions. Negroes who had lived for some time in the
"Black Belt" were eager to escape from it, and here was their opportunity.
They did not wish to go too far from their churches and other established
institutions, and Hyde Park was immediately adjoining.
</p>

<p>
Conditions in Hyde Park during 1916 and 1917 favored the overflow.
Numbers of new, and in some instances high-grade, apartment houses had
been built during the previous ten or fifteen years. Many whites were leaving
their individual houses to live in these apartments or to move to the North
and South Shore regions. The houses had become less desirable, and many of
them were vacant. The district, except for certain definite neighborhoods,
had lost much of its former aristocratic air, with the coming of rooming-and
boarding-houses. During 1914, 1915, and 1916 many houses and apartments
in Hyde Park were vacant or were rented at low prices. Inducements were
offered to prospective tenants in the form of extensive decorations and repairs,
or some rental allowance.
</p>

<p>
Negroes bought houses and apartment buildings and rented anything
rentable. This expansion of the Negro boundaries was promoted by both
white and Negro real estate agents and property owners with little opposition.
These men soon learned that Negroes, with their increased wages due to war
conditions, were able to make first payments, at least, on houses and to rent
better houses or flats than they had previously been obliged to occupy.
</p>

<p>
Then the entrance of the United States into the war in 1917 and the
suspension of building operations occasioned a house shortage which became
acute in 1918. The white demand for dwellings began to exceed the supply.
Real estate men of the neighborhood began to discuss plans for re-establishing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
it as an exclusively white neighborhood. A survey by the Kenwood and Hyde
Park Property Owners' Association showed that of the 3,300 property owners
in the district, about 1,000 were Negroes. Neighbors had objected little, the
entrance of the Negroes having been so gradual that it was almost unnoticeable.
</p>

<p>
Both Kenwood and Hyde Park, using these terms in the more restricted
sense of the original residential localities that bore the names, had enjoyed the
activities of local improvement organizations whose function it was to keep
the streets sprinkled and clean, to procure better lighting, and otherwise
improve civic conditions. The Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners'
Association became prominent in 1918 on account of its agitation to "make
Hyde Park white." In October, 1918, a form letter was sent out calling a
meeting of the Grand Boulevard district of this Association for October 20.
The letter said in part: "We are a red blood organization who say openly,
we won't be driven out. We make no secret of our methods, they are effective
and legal." A dodger announcing the same meeting read:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Every white person Property Owner in Hyde Park come to this meeting. Protect
your Property.
</p>

<p>
Shall we sacrifice our property for a third of its value and run like rats from a
burning ship, or shall we put up a united front and keep Hyde Park desirable for
ourselves? It's not too late.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Grand Boulevard district, described as extending from Thirty-ninth
to Sixty-third streets, and from Michigan to Cottage Grove avenues was
included in the consolidated organization of the Hyde Park and Kenwood
districts. This Association, as was asserted by its president, also had the
co-operation of three other similar organizations, one in the Washington Park
district, the Lake Front Community Property Owners' Association, operating
in the district north of Thirty-ninth Street and south of Thirty-third Street,
east of Cottage Grove Avenue; and one in the Englewood district, which is
southwest of Hyde Park.
</p>

<p>
Organization of sentiment: It does not appear that the residents of this
neighborhood rose spontaneously to oppose the coming in of Negroes. If this
had been the case, the first Negroes moving into the district in 1917 would have
felt the opposition. The sudden interest in race occupancy was based upon
the alleged depreciation of property by Negroes. With this emphasized, it
was not difficult to rally opposition to Negroes as a definite menace. The real
estate men gave the alarm, alleging a shrinkage in property values. The effort
through the Hyde Park and Kenwood Association was intended to stop the
influx and thereby the depreciation. Meetings were held, a newspaper was
published, and literature was distributed. Racial antagonism was strong in
the speeches at these meetings and in the newspapers. The meeting which
probably marked the first focusing of attention on the Kenwood and Hyde
Park districts was held May 5, 1919, when the sentiment was expressed that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
Negro invasion of the district was the worst calamity that had struck the city
since the Great Fire. A prominent white real estate man said: "Property
owners should be notified to stand together block by block and prevent such
invasion."
</p>

<p>
Distinctly hostile sentiments were expressed before audiences that came
expecting to hear how their property might be saved from "almost certain
destruction." A speaker at one of the meetings said in part:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We are taught that the principle of virtue and right shall be the rule of our
conduct in all of our transactions with our fellow-men, and therefore it is our duty
to help the Negro, to uplift him in his environment, mark you, not ours. But it is
not our duty, now mark this, it is not our duty as I see it, nor is it according to the
laws of nature for us to live with him as neighbors or on a social basis. There is an
immutable, unchanging law that governs the distribution, association and conduct
of all living creatures. Man is no exception to the universal rule. In every land and
clime man obeys the second law of his nature and seeks his own kind, avoiding every
other, and ever, ever is he warring with his unlike neighbor, families, classes, societies,
tribes, and nations.
</p>

<p>
There are men who proclaim to the world and ourselves that the destiny of the
black man and the white man is one. I do not believe it; I cannot believe it. Now,
listen! As far back as September 18, 1858, in his famous joint debate with Stephen
A. Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, that wonderful, Godlike man, the liberator of the
slaves, said this (Now listen, 1858, over sixty years ago): "I am not nor ever have
been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white
and the black race. I am not nor ever have been in favor of qualifying them to
intermarry with white people, and I will say in addition to this, that there is a physical
difference between the white and black races living together on terms of social and
political equality."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Other remarks of speakers at these meetings were:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The depreciation of our property in this district has been two hundred and fifty
millions since the invasion. If someone told you that there was to be an invasion
that would injure your homes to that extent, wouldn't you rise up as one man and
one woman, and say as General Foch said: "They shall not pass"?
</p>

<p class="p2">
There isn't an insurance company in America that will turn around and try to
buck our organization when we as one man give them to understand that it is dangerous
to insure some people.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Why I remember fifteen or twenty years ago that the district down here at
Wabash Avenue and Calumet was one of the most beautiful and highest-class neighborhoods
of this great city. Go down there today and see the ramshackle broken-down
and tumble-down district. That is the result of the new menace that is
threatening this great Hyde Park district. And then tell me whether there are
or not enough red-blooded, patriotic, loyal, courageous citizens of Hyde Park to save
this glorious district from the menace which has brought so much pain and so much
disaster to the district to the south of us.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
You cannot mix oil and water. You cannot assimilate races of a different
color as neighbors along social lines. Remember this: That order is heaven's
first law.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Throughout the meetings, profession was made of friendliness toward the
Negroes, together with a desire to serve their needs and accord them fair
treatment. The <i>Property Owners' Journal</i>, published by the Association, was
less guarded. While some of its columns made similar professions, its remarks
in other columns were characterized by extreme racial bitterness and
antagonism.
</p>

<p>
An apparently conciliatory attitude was also taken by speakers at meetings
of the Hyde Park Association and its Grand Boulevard branch. In a meeting
of the latter on January 19, 1920, the chairman declared that he wished to
say for publication: "We have no quarrel with the colored people. We have
no desire to intimidate them by violence." The mission of the organization,
he said, was peaceable, and it was the purpose to proceed according to law and
order. The Association, he averred, had been charged "by the colored press"
with being parties to bombing outrages. He wanted it known that "we have
denounced officially the action of anyone or any set of people who would indulge
in a practice of that character." The story of the bombing campaign is given
in another section of this report.
</p>

<p>
At another meeting it was asserted that the Kenwood and Hyde Park
Association had a membership of 1,000 persons, and it was estimated that in
the district to which it applied the investment in real estate was $1,000,000,000.
The purpose of the organization was declared to be "to guard that
$1,000,000,000 against depreciation from anything." One speaker said he
did not believe there was a piece of property west of Cottage Grove Avenue
in Hyde Park that was worth 33 cents on the dollar "as it stands now with
this invasion." He said his home cost about $25,000, but he felt safe in saying
that he could not then get $8,000 for it. A city alderman was one of the
speakers at this meeting.
</p>

<p>
Most of the real estate dealers in the area were claimed as members of the
Kenwood and Hyde Park Association or its Grand Boulevard branch. Special
reference was made at various times and in scathing terms to dealers who
declined to affiliate. At the meeting of the Grand Boulevard district on
January 19, 1920, it was reported that the Executive Committee of the parent
association had succeeded during the previous two or three months in educating
real estate men. "The colored man," a speaker said, "would have never
been in this district had not our real estate men in their ambition to acquire
wealth and commissions, which is perfectly legitimate, put them here, although
this action on their part has been very shortsighted, as some of them now
admit." This speaker said also that the Association's "greatest successes"
had been in getting all but five or six of the real estate men to sign a pledge
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
not to show or rent or sell any property "within our locality that we claim
jurisdiction of in the future to colored people."

</div>

<p>
The <i>Property Owners' Journal</i> exerted no little influence in the creation
of this sentiment. Claiming a wide circulation, its utterances were so
extreme in bitterness against Negroes that many of the residents of the district,
although opposed to the coming in of Negroes, held aloof from the organization
because they could not indorse appeals to race hatred and advocacy of measures
which they felt were illegal and dangerously near to violence. These extracts
are from its issue of December 13, 1919:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
To damage a man's property and destroy its value is to rob him. The person
who commits that act is a robber. Every owner has the right to defend his property
to the utmost of his ability with every means at his disposal.
</p>

<p>
Any property owner who sells property anywhere in our district to undesirables
is an enemy to the white owner and should be discovered and punished.
</p>

<p>
Protect your property!
</p>

<p>
Property conservatively valued at $50,000,000 owned by some 10,000 individuals
is menaced by a possible Negro invasion of Hyde Park. The thing is simply impossible
and must not occur.
</p>
</div>

<p>
These are from its issue of January 1, 1920:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
As stated before, every colored man who moves into Hyde Park knows that he
is damaging his white neighbors' property. Therefore, he is making war on the white
man. Consequently, he is not entitled to any consideration and forfeits his right
to be employed by the white man. If employers should adopt a rule of refusing to
employ Negroes who persist in residing in Hyde Park to the damage of the white
man's property, it would soon show good results.
</p>

<p>
The Negro is using the Constitution and its legal rights to abuse the moral
rights of the white.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is from its issue of February 15, 1920:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There is nothing in the make-up of a Negro, physically or mentally, which should
induce anyone to welcome him as a neighbor. The best of them are insanitary,
insurance companies class them as poor risks, ruin alone follows in their path. They
are as proud as peacocks, but have nothing of the peacock's beauty. Certain classes
of the Negroes, such as the Pullman porters, political heelers and hairdressers are
clamoring for equality. They are not content with remaining with the creditable
members of their race, they seem to want to mingle with the whites. Their inordinate
vanity, their desire to shine as social lights caused them to stray out of their paths
and lose themselves. We who would direct them back where they belong, towards
their people, are censured and called "unjust." Far more unjust are their actions
to the members of their race who have no desire to interfere with the homes of the
white citizens of this district. The great majority of the Negroes are not stirred
by any false ambition that results only in discord. Wherever friction arises between
the races, the suffering is usually endured by the innocent. If these misleaders are
sincere in their protestations of injustice, if they are not hypocritical in their pretence
of solving the race question, let them move. Their actions savour of spite against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
the whites, whose good will can never be attained by such tactics. The place for
a Negro aristocrat is in a Negro neighborhood.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the same issue, under the heading <i>Caveat Vendor</i> (Let the Seller Beware)
appeared the following:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
People who sell their property to Negroes and take first and second mortgages
and promises to pay monthly sums do not know what risks they are taking in trying
to collect the money. Mrs. Nora Foster of 4207 Prairie sold her house to some
niggers and when she went to collect she was assaulted and thrown down a flight of
stairs. This is not a case of saying it served her right because more than seven of
her neighbors sold before Mrs. Foster did, but it does serve as a splendid example
of the fact that niggers are undesirable neighbors and entirely irresponsible and
vicious.
</p>

<p>
The Negroes' innate desire to "flash," to live in the present, not reckoning the
future, their inordinate love for display has resulted in their being misled by the
example of such individuals as Jesse Binga and Oscar De Priest. In their loud mouthing
about equality with the whites they have wormed their course into white neighborhoods,
where they are not wanted and where they have not the means to support
property.
</p>

<p>
Keep the Negro in his place, amongst his people and he is healthy and loyal.
Remove him, or allow his newly discovered importance to remove him from his proper
environment and the Negro becomes a nuisance. He develops into an overbearing,
inflated, irascible individual, overburdening his brain to such an extent about social
equality, that he becomes dangerous to all with whom he comes in contact, he constitutes
a nuisance, of which the neighborhood is anxious to rid itself.
</p>

<p>
Another building which has been polluted by Negro tenancy is to be renovated
on May 1st.... Either the Negro must vanish or decay sets in. Who is next?
</p>

<p>
Misleaders of the Negro, those flamboyant, noisy, witless individuals, who, by
power of superior gall and gumption, have blustered their way into positions of prominence
amongst their people, wonder why this district resents their intrusion. To allow
themselves an opportunity to parade their dusky persons before an audience of their
followers, these misleaders held a meeting of the Protective Circle (composed, no
doubt, of Negro roundheads), at which a varied assortment of Negro preachers,
politicians and other what nots exposed our methods and organization work. With
much comical oratory, they dangled our association before the spellbound eyes of
their sable dupes and after extreme fuming and sweating appointed about fifteen
committees to annihilate all Hyde Parkers.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
III. BOMBINGS
</h4>

<p>
A form of organized resistance to the coming of Negroes into new neighborhoods
was the bombings of their homes and the homes of real estate men,
white and Negro, who were known or supposed to have sold, leased, or rented
local property to them.
</p>

<p>
From July 1, 1917, to March 1, 1921, the Negro housing problem was
marked by fifty-eight bomb explosions. Two persons, both Negroes, were
killed, a number of white and colored persons were injured, and the damage
to property amounted to more than $100,000. Of these fifty-eight bombs,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
thirty-two were exploded within the square bounded by Forty-first and
Sixtieth streets, Cottage Grove Avenue and State Street. With an average
of one race bombing every twenty days for three years and eight months,
the police and the state's attorney's office succeeded in apprehending but two
persons suspected of participation in these acts of lawlessness. One of these,
James Macheval, arrested on the complaint of C. S. Absteson, a janitor,
was released on a $500 bond. At the writing of this report, one year after the
arrest, there has been no trial. Another man was apprehended, questioned,
held under surveillance for two days by the police, and finally released.
</p>

<p>
News of threatened bombings in many cases was circulated well in advance
of the actual occurrence. Negroes were warned of the exact date on which
explosions would occur. They asked for police protection, and, in some
instances where police were sent beforehand, their homes were bombed, and
no arrests were made.
</p>

<p>
The persons directing these bombings did not limit their intimidations to
Negro residents in white neighborhoods; residences of Negroes and white
real estate men were bombed because they had sold or rented property
in these exclusive areas to Negroes, and Negro bankers' houses were bombed
because they made loans on Negro property and supported their mortgages.
</p>

<p>
These bombings increased rapidly in frequency and damaging effect.
The six months' period ended October 1, 1920, witnessed as many bombings
as the entire thirty-five months preceding. Prior to 1919 there were twelve
bombings. Four of these were directed at properties merely held by Negro
real estate men as agents, two of them in Berkeley Avenue just north of
Forty-third Street, and near the lake. Five were in the 4500 block on Vincennes
Avenue, two at 4200 Wabash Avenue, and one at 4732 Indiana Avenue.
</p>

<p>
Bombing of real estate men's properties appears to have been part of a
general scheme to close the channels through which the invasion proceeded
rather than a protest of neighbors. The four explosions in the 4500 block on
Vincennes Avenue appear to have been deliberately aimed at the tenants.
This block is at the center of the neighborhood most actively opposed to the
coming in of Negroes. In January, 1919, a white and a Negro real estate
agent were bombed; in March, Jesse Binga's real estate office at 4724 State
Street and an apartment at 4041 Calumet Avenue were bombed. In April
there were two more bombings, one of a realty office. Following a public
meeting on May 5 to arouse white property owners of the Hyde Park district
against Negro invasion, there were four bombings. Between January 1, 1920,
and March 1, 1920, there were eight bombings in eight weeks. Responsibility
for the creation of the sentiment thus expressed was in some instances assumed
by organizations. For example the <i>Property Owners' Journal</i>, in its issue
for February 1, 1920, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Our neighborhood must continue white. This sentiment is the outgrowth of the
mass meeting of property owners and residents which was held Monday, January 19.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
Mr. George J. Williams furnished the climax of the meeting when he informed the
audience in terse, pithy language that "Hyde Park enjoys a reputation too splendid
as a neighborhood of white culture to allow Negroes to use it as their door mat."
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the issue of December 13, 1919, white and Negro real estate men and
owners selling property to Negroes in the district were "branded as unclean
outcasts of society to be boycotted and ostracized in every possible manner,"
and W. B. Austin, white, was accused of violating a gentleman's obligation to
his community in selling a home to a Negro. It was asserted falsely that the
house which he had sold had been used during the race riots as a "rendezvous
for Negroes who fired volleys of revolver shots from doors and windows at
white boys in the street who, according to the testimony of neighbors, had
not attacked the premises."
</p>

<p>
On December 26 the home of J. H. Coleman, a white real estate man who
had sold a house to a Negro, was bombed. The transaction was not public,
and occupancy was not to take place for five months. On December 27 the
home of Jesse Binga, a Negro real estate man, was bombed. One week later,
on January 6, came the bombing of W. B. Austin, on the North Side.
</p>

<p>
During 1919 and 1920 committees and delegations of whites and Negroes
appealed to the chief of police, the mayor, State's Attorney Hoyne, and the
press, but nothing was done. The mayor referred these matters to his chief
of police. The police were unable to discover the bombers or anyone directing
them. The state's attorney, in response to appeals, emphatically defined his
duty as a prosecuting rather than an apprehending agent. All the while,
however, the bombings continued steadily; no arrests except the two mentioned
were made; and the Negro population grew to trust less and less in the interest
of the community and the public agencies of protection.
</p>

<h5>
1. TYPICAL BOMBINGS
</h5>

<p>
The circumstances of the bombings were investigated by the Commission,
and details of what happened in several typical cases are here presented.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Bombing of the Motley home.</i>â€”In 1913 S. P. Motley, Negro, and his wife purchased
a building at 5230 Maryland Avenue through a white agent, and on March 15, 1913,
the family moved in. For four years they lived there without molestation save the
silent resentment of neighbors and open objection to the presence of Negro children
in the streets. On July 1, 1917, without warning or threat, a bomb was exploded in
the vestibule of the house, and the front of the building was blown away. The
damage amounted to $1,000. Police arrived from the station at Fifty-second Street
and Lake Park Avenue ten minutes after the explosion. No clews were found and
no arrests were made. The original owner of the building was bitterly opposed to
Negroes and was a member of an organization which was seeking to keep Negroes
out of the district.
</p>

<p>
Some time after this incident it was rumored that Motley was planning to purchase
the building adjacent. At 4:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> June 4, 1919, a dynamite bomb was exploded
under the front of the house adjacent and tore up its stone front. The neighbors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
were in the street immediately after the explosion. No clews were found and no
arrests were made. The Motley family on this occasion was accused of inviting
another Negro family into the block. The new family in question negotiated
for its own property, and before an actual settlement had been made, received numerous
telephone messages and threats. It moved in, but was not bombed.

</div>

<p>
<i>Bombing of Moses Fox's home.</i>â€”Moses Fox, white, connected with a "Loop"
real estate firm, lived at 442 East Forty-fifth Street. The house was too large, and
he decided to move to smaller quarters. The building was sold through a real estate
firm to persons whom he did not know. On March 10, 1920, a few days after the sale,
he received a telephone call informing him that he must suffer the consequences of
selling his home to Negroes. At 7:30 that evening an automobile was seen to drive
slowly past his home three times, stopping each time just east of the building. On
the last trip a man alighted, and deposited a long-fuse bomb in the vestibule. The
fuse smoked for four minutes. Attracted by the smoke, Fox ran toward the front
of the house. The bomb exploded before he reached the door. It was loaded with
dynamite and contained slugs which penetrated the windows of buildings across
the street. The evening selected for the bombing was the one on which Patrolman
Edward Owens, Negro, was off duty and a white policeman was patrolling his beat.
The bombing was witnessed by Dan Jones, a Negro janitor, and Mrs. Florence
De Lavalade, a Negro tenant. The front of the building was wrecked and all the
windows shattered. Damage amounting to $1,000 was done. No arrests were
made.

<i>Bombing of Jesse Binga's properties.</i>â€”Jesse Binga is a Negro banker and real
estate man. His bank is at 3633 State Street, his real estate office at 4724 State
Street, and his home at 5922 South Park Avenue. He controls more than $500,000
worth of property and through his bank has made loans on Negro property and taken
over the mortgages of Negroes refused by other banks and loan agencies.
</p>

<p>
On November 12, 1919, an automobile rolled by his realty office and a bomb
was tossed from it. It left the office in ruins. The police were soon on the scene,
but the car was well beyond reach by the time of their arrival. No clews to the
bombers were found, and no arrests were made. It was the opinion of the police
that white residents of the Hyde Park district resented Binga's handling of Negro
property in that district.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-one days later an automobile drew up in front of Binga's home at 5922
South Park Avenue, and its occupants put a bomb under the front steps. It failed
to explode. When the firemen arrived they found it sizzling in the slush beneath
the porch. The police declared that this was an expression of racial feeling.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-five days later the bombers reappeared and left a third bomb. It tore
up the porch of Binga's home. Again the police found that the explosion had been
caused by "racial feeling," white men having said that "Binga rented too many flats
to Negroes in high-class residence districts." The house was repaired and police
provided to guard the house. At twelve o'clock each night the guard changed watch.
On the night of February 28 the policeman on duty until twelve o'clock left a few
minutes early, and the policeman relieving him was just a few minutes late. In this
unguarded interval an automobile swung around the corner, and as it passed the
Binga home a man leaned out and tossed a bomb into the yard. The bomb lit in
a puddle of water and the fuse went out. It was found that the bomb had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
made of black powder, manila paper, and cotton. The explanation of the attempt
was that "his $30,000 home is in a white neighborhood."
</p>

<p>
A police guard was still watching the house on the night of June 18, 1920 when the
bombing car appeared again. On this occasion neither policeman was in sight when
the car drew up. A man alighted this time and carefully placed the bomb. The
explosion that followed almost demolished the front of the house and smashed windows
throughout the block. This last explosion damaged the home to the extent of $4,000.
Binga offered a reward of $1,000 for the apprehension of those guilty of these repeated
acts of lawlessness.
</p>

<p>
On November 23 Binga was bombed again. This time the bomb damaged his
neighbors more seriously than it did Binga's property. No clews were found and no
one was arrested.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bombing of R. W. Woodfolk's home.</i>â€”R. W. Woodfolk, Negro banker and real
estate dealer, purchased a flat at 4722 Calumet Avenue. It was an investment of
the Merchants and Peoples' Bank, 3201 South State Street, which he controlled.
The building was occupied by one white and four Negro families. On the evening
of February 1, 1920, a person with keys to the building locked the tenants in their
apartments, sprung the locks of the doors leading to the street, and planted a bomb
in the hallway. The explosion ripped up the hall and stairway, tore away the brick
work around the entrance, and shattered the windows of adjacent buildings. The
damage was estimated at $1,000. No arrests were made.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bombing of the Clarke home.</i>â€”Mrs. Mary Byron Clarke, Negro, purchased through
W. B. Austin, a white banker and real estate man, properties at 4404 and 4406 Grand
Boulevard, vacant for a year at the time of purchase, and previously used by prostitutes.
A real estate dealer herself, she had frequently been assisted by Austin in
financing her transactions, one of which was the sale to Negroes of Isaiah Temple,
a Jewish synagogue at Forty-fifth Street and Vincennes Avenue.
</p>

<p>
The dwellings were renovated and she moved into one of them; the other she
rented. During the riot of July, 1919, her home was attacked by a mob. When the
police arrived in response to a call by the Clarkes, they battered in the doors at the
demand of the mob and arrested Mr. and Mrs. Clarke. They were acquitted. On
January 5, 1920, the house was bombed. The explosion caused $3,360 worth of
damage. The building was again bombed February 12, 1920, this time with a dynamite
bomb thrown through the plate-glass door in the hallway from a passing automobile.
The stairway was knocked down and large holes blown in the wall. The
police came, found no clews, and made no arrests. At the request of Mrs. Clarke
a special policeman was detailed to guard the property.
</p>

<p>
Numerous threatening letters and telephone calls followed, all of which were
reported to the police. There were threats of another bombing if she did not sell,
and there were visits from representatives of real estate interests in Hyde Park
making offers.
</p>

<p>
Tuesday evening, April 13, 1920, a third bomb was exploded in spite of the
presence of the two special policemen. The bomb was thrown from the premises of
Frederick R. Barnheisel, an immediate neighbor, a telephone wire deflected it, and
it landed near the Clarke garage.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Clarke made a statement concerning this bombing before the Commission
in which she said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Wednesday [the day following the third bombing] we got a letter saying 'move
out or sell, there is nothing else for you to do. We missed you last night but we will
get you the next time. We are determined.' A letter prior to that stated if we did
not get out they would 'get our hides.'
</p>

<p>
"There has been some sinister influence brought to bear on the insurance company
since the riot and since the first bombing. We have had our house insured against
bombing since the first bombing. The first damage of about $500 they paid and
canceled the insurance on 4404 Grand Boulevard. The second bomb did damage
to the extent of $3,360. They wrote saying they would cancel it, subject however
to pending loss. There was a clause calling for settlement within sixty days. After
sixty days we would have to enter suit to get it. The sixty days have passed, and there
has been no attempt to settle. Some of the glass has been replaced. They have
accepted it, and there has been no disposition on their part to settle.
</p>

<p>
"Berry, Johnston, &amp; Peters, the men with whom we have had the most business
dealings, have insisted that we sell the place. Mr. Peters said last week he could
get a buyer from the Hyde Park-Kenwood Association people, also said if any indebtedness
remained on the contract or deeds, that the money must first be paid to them,
then to us. We have been careful not to let any indebtedness, even for ten days,
come against 4406."
</p>

<p>
<i>Bombing of Crede Hubbard's home.</i>â€”Following is part of Hubbard's statement
to the police immediately after the bombing of his home at 4331 Vincennes Avenue
on the night of April 25, 1920:
</p>

<p>
"The day on which I had planned to move, a man who said he was Mr. Day, of
the Hyde Park and Kenwood Association, telephoned me. He said: 'I hear you have
acquired property and you are dissatisfied with it; we can take it off your handsâ€”relieve
you of it.' I replied that I didn't think I needed any help. He asked, 'What
do you expect to do?' I said, 'I expect to move into it or sell it if I can get my price.'
I moved on Tuesday and Wednesday he called in person. He said, 'I called to find
out if you want us to sell or handle your property for you.' I told him I thought I
could handle it, and that I was not anxious to sell but would consider selling if I could
get an offer of say $11,000. He replied that his buyers were not able to go that far.
He continued, 'The point is, I represent the Hyde Park-Kenwood Association. We
have spent a lot of money and we want to keep this district white.' I asked him
why they had not thought of buying the property before and told him that the house
had been for sale for eight months. He replied that it was a lamentable fact that
they had overlooked it. I told him that I heard the Hyde Park Association had a
$100,000 slush fund out of which $100 was paid for each bombing. He said he would
have some of his buyers come in and look over the property. Shortly afterward,
Mr. Stephen D. Seman and another man came and represented themselves as buyers.
They looked over the inside of the house. I only carried them through the halls.
Mr. Seman said, 'You only paid $8,500 for this property.' I told him that he had
been misinformed, I had paid $9,000. He said, 'I will give you $9,500 for it.' I
refused. As they were leaving he added, 'You had better consider our offer.' Soon
after that a man named Casson, real estate man, called. I would not let him in.
When he asked me my price I told him $11,500.
</p>

<p>
"A week later a delegation from the Hyde Park Association called. The spokesman
began: 'I am Mr. Austin. You understand the nature of our business with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
you, I suppose.' ... I told the chief clerk of the office of the Northwestern Railroad
to inform you that we were coming to see you. We are the Hyde Park-Kenwood
Association and you will understand that you are not welcome in this district. We
want to know what can be done.' I replied that I didn't know what could be done
unless they wanted to buy; otherwise I expected to live there, and my price was
$11,500. They continued, 'Do you suppose if I moved into a black district where
I wasn't wanted, that I would want to live there?' I said, 'If you had bought property
there and liked the property, I don't see why you should move.' They said, 'Why
do you persist in wanting to live here when you know you are not wanted?' I said,
'I have bought property here and I am expecting to live here.' Then they filed out of
the door, and one of the members stated, 'You had better consider this proposition.'
</p>

<p>
"In the office of the Northwestern Railroad, Mr. Shirley called me in and read
a letter to me which he had received from Mr. Austin. 'Murphy, his name is,'
he said, 'I know him fairly well, and I simply want to make an answer to the letter.
Don't think I am trying to influence you one way or the other. This is the letter:
it goes about like this: "Crede Hubbard has purchased a three-flat building at 4332
Vincennes Avenue. Property values are always shot to hell when Negroes move in.
Use whatever influence you have to induce him to sell and find out for us his lowest
figures."' He added, 'Don't think I am trying to brow-beat you into selling this
property.'"
</p>

<p>
"On the following Sunday night on my way back to Milwaukee, I read in
the paper that my house had been bombed. My family was at home, my two boys
sleeping about ten feet from the place that was most seriously damaged. The bomb
was placed inside the vestibule. The girl there heard a taxicab drive up about
twenty-five minutes to twelve and stop for a few minutes and start off again. About
six minutes after the taxicab stopped, the explosion came, and in about five minutes
there were not less than 300 people on the street in front of the place asking questions.
There were a number of plain-clothes men in the crowd. I told my story to the
chief of police and to a sergeant of the police and they said it was evidence enough to
warrant the arrest of the officials of the Association named, but they also thought
that it would do no good.... 'The thing we will have to do is to catch somebody
in the act, sweat him and make him tell who his backers are.'
</p>

<p>
"The police believe that the actual bombing is being done by a gang of young
rough-necks who will stop at nothing, and they expect a pretty serious encounter if
they are interfered with. A big automobile is being shadowed now by the police.
It is used by this bunch of young fellows under suspicion, and it is thought that they
keep the car well loaded with ammunition, and whoever attacks them must expect
trouble. There are four plain-clothes men on guard in this district now. The
police told me to get anything I want from a Mauser to a machine gun and sit back
in the dark, and when anybody comes up to my hallway acting suspiciously to crack
down on him and ask him what he was there for afterwards."
</p>

<p>
<i>Bombing of the Harrison home.</i>â€”Mrs. Gertrude Harrison, Negro, living alone
with her children, contracted to buy a house at 4708 Grand Boulevard. In March,
1919, she moved in. She immediately received word that she had committed a
grave error. She and her children were constantly subjected to the insulting remarks
both of her immediate neighbors and passers-by.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On May 16, 1919, a Negro janitor informed her that neighbors were planning
to bomb her house. She called up the Forty-eighth Street police station and told of
the threatened danger. The officer answering the telephone characterized her report
as "idle talk" and promised to send a man to investigate. The regular patrolman
came in and promised to "keep an eye on the property," but there were ten blocks
in his beat. A special guard was secured and paid by Mrs. Harrison when it was
learned that one would not be furnished by the police.
</p>

<p>
The following night, May 17, her house was bombed while the patrolman was
"punching his box" two blocks away and the special watchman was at the rear.
A detail of police was then provided both at the front and rear. The following
night a bomb was thrown on the roof of the house from the window of a vacant flat
in the adjoining apartment house. The flat from which the bomb was thrown had
been unlocked to admit the bombers and locked again. The police failed to question
either the persons living in the apartment or those leaving it immediately after the
explosion.
</p>

<p>
The first explosion blew out the front door and shattered the glass in the front
of the house. The bomb was filled with gravel and bits of lead. The second was of
similar character, but did not do as much damage. No arrests were made.
</p>

<span class="s08">This bomb was thrown into a building at 3365 Indiana Avenue, occupied by Negroes. A

</div>

<p>
In all these fifty-eight bombings the police have been able to accomplish
nothing definite. Practically every incident involved an automobile, descriptions
of which were furnished by witnesses. The precautions taken to prevent
bombings, even if they were well planned and systematically carried out,
failed lamentably.
</p>

<h5>
2. REACTION OF WHITES IN HYDE PARK
</h5>

<p>
Increasing frequency of bombings, failure of the police to make arrests,
and the apparent association of these acts of open violence with the white
residents of Hyde Park drew out explanations.
</p>

<p>
Pastors of churches in the district who, it had been charged, helped to
give circulation to printed sentiments of the organized opposition to the
"invasion" were strong in their repudiation. The menace to law and order
was definitely recognized and the public given to understand that neither the
pastor nor his congregation had encouraged acts of lawlessness in any manner.
In a statement to a Commission investigator, one of these pastors said, "I am
not in sympathy with the methods and am very doubtful about the aims of
the Property Owners' Association and have, therefore, been unable to join
them or indorse their efforts."
</p>

<p>
A local paper, the <i>Real Estate News</i>, published a long article in February,
1920, on "Solving Chicago's Race Problem." It was directed at South Side
property owners and carried a stern warning "against perils of boycott and
terrorism being promoted by local protective associations." Referring to
the bombing outrages, this paper, under the heading "Danger in Boycotts
and Bombs," said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In Kenwood and Hyde Park, particularly, a number of "protective associations"
have been formed. Property owners have been urged to join these bodies, which,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
without attempt at concealment, advocate a boycott against all persons of a certain
race. At meetings of these groups there has been open advocacy of violence. There
has been incendiary talk. Bombs and bullets have been discussed, and speakers
talking thus have been applauded. There have been repeated acts of violence.
Night bombing of Negro homes and apartments has taken place. Bombing and
shooting is increasing in frequency.
</p>

<p>
The time has come, we believe, for a word of solemn warning to all South Side
property owners. It is: Keep out of those associations. If you are now in, get out!
For you are in great danger of the penitentiary! You are in grave peril of losing
your property by damage suits!
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another excerpt, under the heading "Perils of 'Protective' Organizations,"
said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
No one can justly criticize men for forming organizations to protect or advance
their own interests lawfully. Property owners ought to unite wherever practicable
for proper and lawful purposes beneficial to themselves. For such unions operate
to the welfare of all.
</p>

<p>
Recently, however, a number of men have joined in forming and promoting
organizations on the South Side which are perilous to themselves and to every property
owner who joins them. Owners of real estate should be the last men in the world
to get mixed up in movements involving violence, threats, intimidations, or boycotts.
Because they are responsible. Their wealth cannot be concealed. Judgments
against them are collectible.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Under the heading "Drastic Laws Forbid Conspiracies":
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The law of conspiracy is drastic. Conspiracy is an association together of
persons for the purpose of doing an unlawful thing in an unlawful way, or a lawful
thing in an unlawful way, or an unlawful thing in a lawful way. Under the law,
all persons in a conspiracy are equally guilty. One need not throw a bomb, or even
know of the intent of throwing a bomb, to be found guilty. The act of one, no matter
how irresponsible, is the act of all.
</p>

<p>
Any association formed in Chicago for the purpose of, or having among its aims,
refusal to sell, lease or rent property to any citizen of a certain race, is an unlawful
association. Every act of such an association for advancement of such an aim is
an act of conspiracy, punishable criminally and civilly in the District Court of the
United States. And every member of such an association is equally guilty with
every other member. If one member hires a bomber, or a thug who commits murder
in pursuance of the aims of the association, all the organization may be found guilty
of conspiracy to destroy property or to commit murder, as the case may be.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This entire article was widely circulated in the disturbed neighborhoods
by the Protective Circle, an organization of Negroes, 25,000 copies being mailed
to residents of Hyde Park.
</p>

<p>
Residents of the district, stirred by the succession of bombings, began to
protest. The paper of the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association
reflected this feeling in a statement declaring that the Association had no
connection with the bombings, and that its president was considering the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
advisability of assisting the authorities in apprehending these lawless individuals.
On another occasion, this paper took pains to explain that the bombing of
George A. Hyers' property on March 5 was an outgrowth of labor troubles
and not of a property owners' organization recently formed in this community.
At a meeting of the General Committee of the Property Owners' Association
the following resolution was unanimously adopted:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Our attention has been called to various explosions of bombs in our
neighborhood at the houses of colored people living in this vicinity, and
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, While we are anxious to persuade these people to move from this
locality, we are opposed to violence of every description, therefore, be it
</p>

<p>
<i>Resolved</i>, That we condemn the action of anyone resorting to throwing of bombs
or other methods not in accordance with reason, law or justice.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The attention of the city was directed to these unlawful happenings and
protests from both white and Negro individuals made themselves heard.
The bombings, however, did not abate in frequency. Neither were the police
any more successful in locating their sources.
</p>

<h5>
3. REACTION OF NEGROES
</h5>

<p>
From the beginning Negroes were outspoken in their indignation over the
bombings, but their protests had no apparent effect in checking the outrages.
</p>

<p>
The attacks, however, have made the Negroes firm in their stand. Mrs.
Clarke was bombed four times; she still lives in the property and declares
that she will not be driven out. Jesse Binga has been bombed six times but
states he will not move. Only two of the forty Negro families bombed have
moved; the others have made repairs, secured private watchmen or themselves
kept vigil for night bombers, and still occupy the properties.
</p>

<p>
Following the bombing of Jesse Binga on June 18, 1920, the <i>Chicago Daily
News</i> quoted him as saying to a policeman, "This is the limit; I'm going."
When his attention was called to the statement he promptly replied:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Statements relative to my moving are all false. My idea of this bombing of my
house is that it is an effort to retard the Binga State Bank which will take over the
mortgages of colored people now buying property against which effort is being made
to foreclose. I will not run. The race is at stake and not myself. If they can make
me move they will have accomplished much of their aim because they can say, "We
made Jesse Binga move; certainly you'll have to move," to all of the rest. If they
can make the leaders move, what show will the smaller buyers have? Such headlines
are efforts to intimidate Negroes not to purchase property and to scare some of them
back South.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In February a group of Negroes formed themselves into a body known as
the Protective Circle of Chicago, the purpose of which, as stated in its constitution,
was "to combat, through legal means, the lawlessness of the Kenwood
and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association and by organized effort to bring
pressure to bear on city authorities to force them to apprehend those persons
who have bombed the homes of twenty-one Negroes."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A mass meeting was held February 29, 1920, with 3,000 Negroes present.
A popular appeal for funds for the purposes of this organization raised $1,000.
Attacks were directed against the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners'
Association. A representative of the Protective Circle said in part:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Hyde Park Property Owners' Association is not a new thing. It is more
than eighteen years old. Eighteen years ago they proposed fourteen points as a
platform for their Association. The thirteenth point was that they would keep out
undesirables. All Negroes were classed as undesirables. Ten years ago Dr. Jenifer,
a Negro minister, appeared before the Association and severely criticized the organization
for its un-American policies. It is just recently that this organization has shown
its hand openly, and the things that they have said and done are dangerously near to
illegality. I have in my files this statement taken from a stenographic report of one
of their meetings, made by the president of the Association: "If Negroes do not get
out of Hyde Park, we will get Bolsheviks to bomb them out." The bombers of the
homes of Negroes have been allowed to get away unpunished. Judge Gary hanged
numbers of anarchists in the Haymarket riot for very much less complicity in bomb
outrages than these men are guilty of. Hatred can never be counteracted by hatred.
We cannot put any stop to the bombings of Negro homes by going out and bombing
homes of white persons.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Negro press severely condemned the bombings, and the Negro population
in general felt that the apathy of city authorities and even the influential
public was responsible for continuance of the outrages. Protests were sent
to the governor of the state. The mayor, chief of police, and state's attorney
were persistently importuned to stop the destruction of Negroes' property
and remove the menace to their lives. Negroes pointed out, for example,
that the authorities had shown ability to apprehend criminals, even those
suspected of bomb-throwing. They cited the bombing of the home of a professional
white "gunman," when eleven suspected bombers were caught in the
dragnet of the state's attorney within thirty hours. Yet in fifty-eight bombings
of Negro homes only two suspects were ever arrested.
</p>

<p>
In March, 1920, a Commission from the Chicago Church Federation
Council sent a delegation to Mayor Thompson, Chief of Police Garrity, and
State's Attorney Hoyne, to demand action on the bombing of Negroes' homes.
Prominent white and colored men comprised this delegation. A prominent
Negro, testifying before the Commission, said that he, with other Negroes,
both from the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, and from other organizations, had carried their grievances
to city officials. He said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have been to the mayor's office, we have been to the state's attorney's office,
we have sent representatives to both these offices, and nothing has been doneâ€”possibly
something is being done, but nothing of great moment. I think that the
colored people feel that they are so insecure in their physical rights that rather than
take any chance they're going out and paying whatever the charge is for insurance
against bombing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another delegation of Negroes in June, 1919, twice attempted to register
a complaint with the mayor against bomb outrages. The mayor's secretary,
however, refused them an audience with the mayor.
</p>

<p>
The editors of local daily papers have also been visited by mixed white
and Negro delegations in an endeavor to arouse public opinion.
</p>

<p>
The effect of these delegations and protests has been small. One joint
conference with the mayor, chief of police, and state's attorney brought out
the information that it was beyond the state's attorney's province to make
arrests. The mayor, after some discussion, instructed Chief of Police Garrity to
do what he could toward putting a stop to the bombing of Negroes' homes. The
chief of police, after explaining the shortage of patrolmen, said he would do so.
</p>

<p>
The bombing question began to figure in local politics. Charges were
made before the primary election of September, 1920, that the city administration
had not given Negroes the protection it had promised. The matter of
apprehending the "nefarious bomb plotters" was included in the platforms
of Negroes running for office, and in those of white candidates seeking Negro
votes.
</p>

<p>
The Commission had neither authority nor facilities for accomplishing
what all public agencies had signally failed to do. It could, however, and did,
go over the trail of the bombers and collect information which shows that the
sentiment aroused in the contested neighborhoods was a factor in encouraging
actual violence. Whatever antagonisms there were before the agitation were
held in restraint, even though Negroes were already neighbors. Other districts,
like Woodlawn and sections of the North Side, undergoing almost
identical experiences as those of Hyde Park, have had no violence; the absence
of stimulated sentiment is as conspicuous as the absence of violence. In the
Hyde Park district, between Thirty-ninth and Forty-seventh streets and State
Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, four-fifths of the bombings occurred.
All but three of those happening outside the district were against real estate
men accused of activities affecting the Hyde Park District. It seemed,
especially in the first bombings, that the bombers had information about
business transactions which the general public could not ordinarily get. Houses
were bombed in numbers of cases long before their occupancy by Negroes.
Each of the bombings was apparently planned, and the opportune moment
came after long vigil and, as it would seem, after deliberately setting the
stage. The first bombing of Binga does not appear to have been the result
of resentment of neighbors in the vicinity of his home, for it was his office on
State Street that was bombed. His office is in a neighborhood around which
there is no contest.
</p>

<h5>
4. OTHER MEANS EMPLOYED TO KEEP OUT NEGROES
</h5>

<p>
The Grand Boulevard Property Owners' Association officially decided
that its object should be "the acquisition, management, improvement and disposition,
including leasing, sub-leasing and sale of residential property to both
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
white and colored people within the said district heretofore described." This
district was to include the area from Thirty-fifth to Sixty-third streets, and
from the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad tracks to Lake Michigan.
</p>

<p>
In August, 1920, the manager of the Association cited an instance in which
it had functioned. On Vernon Avenue a white man had sold property direct
to Negroes. The next-door neighbor had arranged a similar sale to potential
Negro buyers. The neighbor next to him, a widow, loath to lose her home,
appealed to the Association. After a conference with the possible Negro
buyers, their money was returned to them, the Association purchased the house
in question, and the whole matter was thus amicably arranged.
</p>

<p>
During April, 1920, inquiries were made by the Commission into the unrest
caused by rumors that 800 Negro families intended to move into Hyde Park.
It developed that May 1, the customary "moving day," was feared both by
whites in Hyde Park and by Negroes in and out of Hyde Park. Negroes
living there feared that an attempt would be made to oust them by canceling
or refusing to renew their leases, and whites thought Negroes might get possession
of some of the properties vacated on that date. The Commission found,
however, only eighteen instances where leases were canceled on houses occupied
by Negroes who were having difficulty in finding other places to live.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1920 the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners'
Association stated that sixty-eight Negro families had been moved through
cancellation of leases and mortgage foreclosures.
</p>

<p>
Incidental to the general plan of opposition to the entrance of Negroes in
Hyde Park was the sending of threatening letters. For example, in August,
1919, a leading Negro real estate agent and banker received this pen-printed
notice by mail:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="return-container">
<p class="returnc">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters of the White Hands</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Territory, Michigan Ave. to Lake Front</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
You are the one who helped cause this riot by encouraging Negroes to move into
good white neighborhoods and you know the results of your work. This trouble
has only begun and we advise you to use your influence to get Negroes to move out
of these neighborhoods to <i>Black Belt</i> where they belong and in conclusion we advise
you to get off South Park Ave. yourself. Just take this as a warning. You know
what comes next.
</p>

<div class="signature-container">
<p class="ilb">Respect.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Warning Com.</span>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
This man's home and office have been bombed a number of times. Efforts
were made to buy out individual Negroes who had settled in the district, as
well as to cause renters to move out. There are numerous incidents of this
nature, with indications of many others. A Negro woman who was living in
the district, told one of the Commission's investigators that she and her
husband had formerly lived in the 3800 block of Lake Park Avenue. White
neighbors caused them so much trouble that they had moved and bought the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
apartment house in which they are now living, renting out the second and third
flats. Almost immediately white people began to call and inquire whether
she was the janitress, or whether she was renting or buying the place. When
she gave evasive answers, letters began to arrive by mail. One letter was
slipped under the door at night. These letters informed her that she was preventing
the sale of the adjoining house because she would not sell and no white
person would live next door to her. She was advised that it would be best
for her to answer and declare her intentions. Two white women called and
offered her $1,500 more than she had paid for the property. She refused
and a few days later she received a letter demanding an immediate answer,
to the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association.
</p>

<p>
Later three white men in overseas uniforms inquired as to the ownership
of the property, asking if she was the janitress and if she knew who the owner
was. She answered in the negative. One of the men tore down a "For Sale"
sign on the adjoining property, and another informed her that it was the intention
to turn the neighborhood back to white people and that all Negroes
must go.
</p>

<p>
This woman is the president of a neighborhood protective league, including
the Negroes in several of the blocks thereabouts. She received a letter from
the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association asking the purposes
and intentions of this league.
</p>

<p>
This woman also reported that a man had been going about the neighborhood
under the pretext of making calling cards, advising Negroes to sell out
and leave the neighborhood, as it was better not to stay where they were not
wanted. Another white man who had been about the neighborhood selling
wearing apparel, told her that two Negro families in the neighborhood would
be bombed. She inquired how he knew this and was told to wait and see.
Within two weeks these bombings had taken place.
</p>

<h4>
IV. TREND OF THE NEGRO POPULATION
</h4>

<p>
In considering the expansion of Negro residential areas, the most important
is the main South Side section where more of the Negro population lives.
This group is hemmed in on the north by the business district and on the
west by overcrowded areas west of Wentworth Avenue, called in this report
"hostile." During the ten years 1910-20 business houses and light manufacturing
plants were moving south from the downtown district, pushing ahead
of them the Negro population between Twelfth and Thirty-first streets. At
the same time the Negro population was expanding into the streets east of
Wabash Avenue. This extension was stopped by Lake Michigan, about
eight blocks east. Negro families then began filtering into Hyde Park, immediately
to the south.
</p>

<p>
In 1917 the Chicago Urban League found that Negroes were then living on
Wabash Avenue as far south as Fifty-fifth street east of State Street, where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
they had moved from the district west of State Street. From Thirty-first
to Thirty-ninth streets, on Wabash Avenue, Negroes had been living from
nine to eleven years, and the approximate percentage of Negroes by blocks
ranged from 95 to 100; from Thirty-ninth Street to Forty-seventh Street
they had been living from one to five years and averaged 50 per cent. The
movement had been almost entirely from the west and north.
</p>

<p>
On Indiana Avenue, from Thirty-first to Forty-second streets, a similar
trend was revealed. In the 3100 block, Negroes had been living for eight
years, in the 3200 block for fourteen years; in the more southerly blocks their
occupancy had been much briefer, ranging down to five months. In the
most northerly of these blocks Negroes numbered 90 per cent and in the most
southerly only 2 per cent.
</p>

<p>
On Prairie Avenue, farther east, two Negro families bought homes in the
3100 block in 1911, but the majority of the Negroes had come in since 1916.
The percentage of Negroes in that block was 50. From Thirty-second to Thirty-ninth
Street the blocks were found to have more than 90 per cent Negroes.
One family had been there five years and the average residence was one and
one-half years. No Negroes were found from Fortieth to Forty-fourth Street
on Prairie Avenue. There were two families in the 4500 block, and none south
of that.
</p>

<p>
On Forest Avenue, from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth Street, 75 per cent
of the families were Negroes and had lived there less than six years.
</p>

<p>
On Calumet Avenue, the next street east of Prairie, Negroes had begun
to live within four years. The population was 75 per cent Negro from Thirty-first
to Thirty-ninth Street. None live south of Thirty-ninth Street, except
at the corner, where they had been living for five months.
</p>

<p>
A similar situation was found on Rhodes Avenue, still farther east, from
Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth Street. Negroes had lived in Vincennes Avenue,
the next street east, less than two years, and in Cottage Grove Avenue, still
farther east less than one year.
</p>

<p>
South Park Avenue and its continuation, Grand Boulevard (south of
Thirty-fifth Street) was the most recent street into which Negroes had moved
in large numbers. This had occurred within the years 1915-17. The first
Negro families had moved into the 3400 block less than four years previously.
The percentage of Negroes between Thirty-first and Thirty-fifth streets was
less than 50. Within five months two Negro families had moved into the
hitherto exclusively white 3500 block.
</p>

<p>
Few Negroes had moved from east of State Street to west of that street.

<h4>
V. OUTLYING NEIGHBORHOODS
</h4>

<p>
The Commission's investigation being confined to the city of Chicago,
the growing Negro colonies in such suburbs as Evanston and Glencoe were not
studied, but attention was given to two southwestern outlying neighborhoods
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
in the east part of Morgan Park, just inside the city limits, and the village of
Robbins, wholly Negro, just outside.
</p>

<h5>
1. MORGAN PARK
</h5>

<p>
In 1910, 126 Negroes lived in Morgan Park, with a total population of
5,269. In 1920 the area had been incorporated in the city of Chicago, and
there were 695 Negroes in a total population of 7,780 occupying approximately
the same area.
</p>

<p>
In its early days Morgan Park was the site of a theological seminary,
which in 1892 became part of the University of Chicago. The first Negroes
there were servants, mostly from the South, working in the households of the
professors. The colony remained, and its more recent increase was due in
considerable measure to the influx of well-to-do Negroes from farther north in
Chicago, many of whom bought houses. In some cases Negroes in congested
Negro residential areas sold out to Negroes arriving in the migration and
re-established themselves in much better dwellings and surroundings in Morgan
Park.
</p>

<p>
Less prosperous Negroes also came, despite the feeling of some home
owners that too great an influx of that type would injure property values and
render the neighborhood less desirable. Many of these work in the South
Chicago steel mills and the shops at Pullman. Some work in the Stock Yards.
</p>

<p>
A number of Negroes of Morgan Park are employed at the Chicago City
Hall. Some are porters on Pullman cars. Only a small number are laborers.
Many of the women sew or work as car cleaners and seem reluctant to do
housework even at day wages.
</p>

<p>
Physically Morgan Park is attractive with comfortable homes and large
grounds. Several churches, a number of schools, and an attractive park all
add to the desirability of the place as a "home town." The lots are deep,
affording plenty of space for gardens, and many vacant lots are cultivated.
The opportunity for garden patches is an attraction for many Negroes. There
are two Negro churches, Methodist and Baptist, and a Colored Men's Improvement
Association which has provided a social hall for the Negro population.
</p>

<p>
School facilities are inadequate, and the buildings are old and overcrowded.
Because of this congestion, it becomes necessary for children in the sixth and
higher grades to go three miles to a school on Western Avenue. About twenty
Negroes attend the high school. In the Esmond Street school approximately
25 per cent of the children are Negroes. The Negroes have repeatedly requested
enlarged school facilities. They want a new building conveniently situated
for their children.
</p>

<p>
The white people of Morgan Park are not unfriendly toward their Negro
neighbors, though there seems to be a common understanding that Negroes
must not live west of Vincennes Road, which bisects the town from northeast
to southwest. A Negro once bought a house across the line but found he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
was so unwelcome that he promptly sold again. More recently the owner of a
three-story brick flat building rented to Negroes the twenty flats above his
stores. A protest was made by both white and Negro house owners, so that
he was forced to eject the Negro tenants.
</p>

<p>
The demand for homes is shown in the numbers of Negroes who go to
Morgan Park on Sundays by automobile, street car, and train. In the spring
of 1920 a number of houses were being erected for Negro occupancy in what
is known in Morgan Park as "No Man's Land," east of Vincennes Road from
109th to 112th streets. This swampy tract of land was being reclaimed.
Streets had been surveyed and laid out, though with little paving. Water,
light, and gas were available, and some efforts at drainage had been made,
leaving some stagnant pools. Other plans involved the building of eighty
five-room bungalows by a Chicago contractor. Six of these were under construction
at the time of the investigator's visit, and five had been sold, corner-lot
houses at $4,550, houses on inside lots at $4,330.
</p>

<p>
Morgan Park Negroes appear to be progressing financially. An officer
of a local trust and savings bank said that they met their obligations promptly,
only occasionally defaulting or suffering foreclosure and then only because of
illness, death, or loss of employment. The same officer said savings accounts
of Negroes were increasing in number, though small in amount.
</p>

<p>
Whites and Negroes maintain a friendly attitude. During the 1919 riots
a number of conferences took place between Negroes and white people of
Morgan Park. The Negroes kept rather close to their own neighborhood,
and the only difficulty the police had was in controlling rowdy white boys.
</p>

<p>
Younger children of the two races play together in the school yards. A
teacher in the Esmond Street school declared that no distinction was made
between Negroes and whites in that school. It was noted, however, that
when games were played, this teacher directed the little Negroes to take little
Negro girls as partners. Some prejudice is discernible among whites in the
community, but there is an evident desire to be fair and to give the Negroes
every reasonable opportunity to exemplify good citizenship so long as they
do not move from their own into the white neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
Those familiar with the Morgan Park settlement believe that it offers
unusual inducements as a home community for Negroes. The contractor who
is already building for Negroes there has confidence in the venture. He has
dealt before with Negroes and found them satisfactory clients.
</p>

<h5>
2. ROBBINS
</h5>

<p>
This village is the only exclusively Negro community near Chicago with
Negroes in all village offices.
</p>

<p>
Robbins is not attractive physically. It is not on a car line and there is no
pretense of paved streets, or even sidewalks. The houses are homemade, in most
cases by labor mornings, nights, and holidays, after or before the day's wage-earning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
Tar paper, roofing paper, homemade tiles, hardly seem sufficient to shut
out the weather; older houses, complete with windows, doors, porches, fences,
and gardens, indicate that some day these shelters will become real houses.
In 1920 the village took out its incorporation papers, and while there are some
who regret this independence and talk of asking Blue Island to annex it, in
the main the citizens are proud of their village and certain of its future. There
are 380 people all told, men, women, and children, living in something more
than seventy houses. It is a long mile down the road to the street car, but
daily men and women trudge away to their work, taking with them the feeling
of home ownership, of a place for the children to play unmolested, of friends
and neighbors.
</p>

<p>
These men and women find many kinds of work in the neighboring
townsâ€”at the mills, on the railroads, in the factories. Many of the women
work in the factory of Libby, McNeil &amp; Libby. Their wages go into payments
for their homes. Men and women together are living as pioneer families
livedâ€”working and sacrificing to feel the independence of owning a bit of
ground and their own house.
</p>

<h3>
C. THE NEGRO COMMUNITY
</h3>

<h4>
I. THE BEGINNING OF THE NEGRO COMMUNITY
</h4>

<p>
Negroes have been living in Chicago since it was founded. In fact, Jean
Baptiste Point de Saible, a San Domingan Negro, was the first settler and in
1790 built the first house, a rude hut on the north bank of the Chicago River
near what is now the Michigan Boulevard Bridge.
</p>

<p>
There are records of Negroes owning property in Chicago as early as 1837, the
year of its incorporation as a city. In 1844 there were at least five Negro property
owners and in 1847 at least ten. Their property was in the original first and
second wards of the city, one on Lake Street, others on Madison, Clark, and
Harrison, and Fifth Avenue. In 1848 the first Negro church property was
purchased at the corner of Jackson and Buffalo streets, indicating the presence
of the first colony of Negroes. In 1850 the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law
caused many to flee for safety to Canada, many of the property owners disposing
of their holdings at a great loss. In 1854 Negroes held two pieces of church
property in the same general locality. Although the great majority lived on
Clark and Dearborn streets north of Harrison Street, there was a tendency
among the property-owning class to invest in outlying property. Some of
them bought property as far south as what is now Thirty-third Street.
</p>

<p>
The year of the Great Fire, 1871, Negroes owned four pieces of church
property. That fire stopped at Harrison Street and did not consume all
of the Negro settlement. A second large fire in 1874 spread northeast and
burned 812 buildings over an area of forty-seven acres. With the rebuilding
of the city they were pushed southward to make room for the business
district.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In 1900 the most congested area of Negro residence, called the "Black
Belt," was a district thirty-one blocks long and four blocks wide, extending
from Harrison Street on the north to Thirty-ninth Street on the south, between
Wabash and Wentworth avenues. Although other colonies had been started
in other parts of the city, notably the West Side, at least 50 per cent of the
1900 Negro population of 30,150 lived in this area. As this main area of Negro
residence grew, the proportion of Negroes to the total Negro population living
in it increased until in 1920 it contained 90 per cent of the Negroes of the city.
</p>

<h4>
II. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NEGRO COMMUNITY
</h4>

<p>
In the discussion of race contacts attention is called to the peculiar conditions
which compel Negroes of the city to develop many of their own institutions
and agencies. Partly from necessity and partly from choice, they have
established their own churches, business enterprises, amusement places, and
newspapers. Living and associating for the most part together, meeting in
the same centers for face-to-face relations, trusting to their own physicians,
lawyers, and ministers, a compact community with its own fairly definite
interests and sentiments has grown up.
</p>

<p>
The institutions within the Negro community that have been developed
to aid it in maintaining itself and promoting its own welfare, are of four general
types: (1) commercial and industrial enterprises; (2) organizations for social
intercourse; (3) religious organizations; (4) agencies for civic and social
betterment.
</p>

<h5>
1. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES
</h5>

<p>
Commercial and industrial establishments conducted by Negroes are
listed by Ford S. Black in his yearly <i>Blue Book</i>, which serves as a directory
of Negro activities. They increased from 1,200 in 1919 to 1,500 in 1920.
The compilation lists 651 on State Street, the main thoroughfare, 549 on
principal cross streets, and more than 300 on other streets. The increase is
strikingly shown in the following figures: In 1918 Negro business places on
Thirty-first Street numbered nine and seventy-one in 1920; on Thirty-fifth
Street there were forty-seven in 1918 and seventy-seven in 1920. On Cottage
Grove Avenue, Negroes have only recently established themselves in large
numbers, yet between Twenty-eighth and Forty-fifth streets there are fifty-seven
Negro business places, including nine groceries, three drug-stores, and
two undertaking establishments.
</p>

<p>
A partial list of business places as listed in Black's <i>Blue Book</i> is given:

<h5>
2. ORGANIZATIONS FOR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE
</h5>

<p>
Various organizations for social intercourse and mutual helpfulness have
developed in the Negro community. Some are local lodges or branches of
national organizations, and others are purely local and independent. Some are
simply for social intercourse, and others have in addition benefit features,
professional interests, etc. Frequent reference is made in the family histories
given in this report to these various organizations.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fraternal organizations.</i>â€”Fraternal organizations are an old institution
among Negroes. In the South they rank next in importance to the church;
in the North they have considerable prestige. Membership is large and interest
is strong. Following is a list of the most active in Chicago:
</p>

<ul class="idx">

<li>Elks, Great Lakes Lodge No. 43, I.B.P.O.<br />
  Elks of the World (an independent order of Elks)</li>
<li>Ancient Order of Foresters</li>
<li>Catholic Order of Foresters</li>
<li>American Woodmen</li>
<li>Builders of America</li>
<li>Knights of Pythias</li>
<li>Mosaic Templars of America</li>
<li>Masons</li>
<li>Grand Court Heroines of Jericho of Illinois</li>
<li>Eastern Star</li>
<li>The Golden Circle</li>
<li>Odd Fellows (G.U.O. of O.F.)</li>
<li>Royal Circle of Friends</li>
<li>United Brotherhood of Friendship</li>
<li>Sisters of the Mysterious Ten</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of these organizations, although having their own rituals, serve as a
means of group control and of exchange of views and opinions. They are also a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
guaranty against absolute friendlessness, and that is perhaps one of the strongest
motives for the establishment of the first organizations years ago. Much charitable
and relief work is carried on by these fraternal bodies among their members.
</p>

<p>
Out of these associations have grown clubs with social activities among
wider circles. There are, for example, the Easter Lily Club, the Mayflower
Club, and the Masonic Progressive Club.
</p>

<p>
<i>Social clubs.</i>â€”Many of the clubs and societies with social, educational,
or professional interests are modeled after those of the larger community.
There are, for example, the Arts and Letters Society, the University Society,
and Civic Study Club. There are also many smaller clubs organized for
various purposes, but designed principally to serve the Negro community.
There are more than seventy women's clubs, leagued in the Chicago Federation
of Colored Women's Clubs. There are also the Art and Charity Club, Chicago
Union Charity Club, Cornell Charity, Dearborn Centre, Diana Charity,
East End 30th Ward, East Side Woman's Club, Eureka Fine Arts, Fideles
Charity, Giles Charity, Hyacinth Charity, Ideal Embroidery Art, Ideal
Woman's Club, Imperial Art, Kenwood Center, Mental Pearls, Mothers' Union,
Necessity Club, New Method Industrial, North Shore, North Side Industrial,
Motley Social Uplift, Phyllis Wheatley Club, Progressive Circle of Kings
Daughters, 37th Ward Civic League, Volunteer Workers, West Side Woman's
City Club, and the Woman's Civic League.
</p>

<p>
Among the exclusive social clubs, perhaps the most important is the
Appomattox Club. Its membership includes the leading business and professional
men, and it has a well-appointed club building. Its membership is
limited and it carries civic and social prestige.
</p>

<p>
The Phalanx Club is an organization of government employees. Its
membership is large, though limited by occupational restriction. Its interests
are largely social. The Forty Club and Half Century Club are purely social
and still more exclusive.
</p>

<p>
Negro professional societies, sometimes formed because of the objections
of whites to the participation of Negroes in white societies of a similar nature,
include the Lincoln Dental Association, Physicians, Dentists and Pharmacists'
Association, a Bar Association, and a Medical Association.
</p>

<h5>
3. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS
</h5>

<p>
<i>Negro churches.</i>â€”The church is one of the first and probably one of the
strongest institutions among Negroes. The importance of churches in the
Negro community lies not only in their large membership and religious
influence, but in their provision of a medium of social control for great numbers
of Chicago Negroes, and in their great value in promoting the adjustment of
newcomers.
</p>

<p>
In the South the churches are the principal centers for face-to-face relations.
They serve as a medium for the exchange of ideas, making and maintaining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
friendships, community co-operation, collective striving, group competition,
as well as for the dissemination of information, assistance and advice on
practical problems, and the upholding of religious ideals. The pastors know
the members personally, and the church exercises a definite control over
individual behavior.
</p>

<p>
The church is often the only Negro social institution with an unhampered
opportunity for development. In most southern cities, Negroes have no
Y.M.C.A., public playground, welfare organizations, public library, gymnasium,
orderly dance halls, public parks, or theaters. The church in a large
degree takes the place of these and fills a vacancy created by the lack of the
public facilities ordinarily found in white communities. In many instances
it determines the social standing of the individual Negro. No one can escape
the opprobrium attached to the term "sinner" if he is not a member of the
church, however successful otherwise.
</p>

<p>
The minister is the recognized leader of the Negroes, and often their
legal adviser and school teacher. He is responsible for the social good behavior
of his people. No movement can get the support of the people unless it has
his sanction.
</p>

<p>
In the North the function of both Negro church and pastor is different.
Negroes can find other places than the church for their leisure time; numerous
urban and civic organizations with trained workers look after their interests,
probably better than the church. In the Y.M.C.A. they find religion related
to the development of their bodies and minds. In northern cities enterprises
and movements thrive without the good-will or sanction of the clergy, and even
against their protest.
</p>

<p>
The field wholly occupied in the South by the church is shared in the
North by the labor union, the social club, lectures, and political and other
organizations. Some of the northern churches, realizing this, have established
employment agencies and other activities of a more social nature in response
to this new demand.
</p>

<p>
<i>Social activities.</i>â€”The churches in Chicago serve as social-contact centers,
though not to the same extent as in the South. Frequently they arrange
lectures, community programs, fÃªtes, and meetings. Many of them, seeking
to influence the conduct of the group, have provided recreation and amusements
for their members. Several churches have social-service departments,
basket-ball teams, and literary societies. Olivet Baptist Church, with a
membership of 9,069, maintains an employment department, rooming directory,
kindergarten, and day nursery, and employs sixteen workers; in its social organization
there are forty-two auxiliary departments. During the last five years
it has raised $200,000, contributed $5,600 for charitable relief, and found jobs
for 1,100 Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Unique among such developments is the People's Church and Metropolitan
Community Center, organized by a group which withdrew from the Bethel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
African Methodist Episcopal Church in October, 1920. Relying solely upon its
membership, it raised $22,000 during its first five months. Six persons are
employed to carry on the work, one a social-service secretary. Land for a
church building has been purchased, and plans have been made to buy a
community-center building to accommodate several thousand people.
</p>

<p>
<i>Relief work.</i>â€”The records of the United Charities, which assumes the care
of dependent children of the juvenile court, show a much smaller proportion
of appeals for aid from Negroes than might be expected. This is partly
explained by the work of the churches in relieving Negro families. A very
high proportion of families below the line of comfortable subsistence belong
to the churches, the small "store-front" churches. The number and variety
of denominational divisions and sects increases competition for membership and
sends pastors and members out into the community to gather in the people.
Forty-one churches, many of them small, reported a total of $15,038 distributed
during 1920 for the relief of the sick and distressed.
</p>

<p>
In a very few cases, Negroes are found to be members of white churches,
but the Negro churches have an entirely Negro membership with Negro
pastors.
</p>

<p>
<i>"Store-front" churches.</i>â€”The "store-front" church membership is merely
a small group which, for one reason or another, has sought to worship independently
of any connection with the larger churches. The establishment
of such a church may be the result of a withdrawal of part of the membership
of a larger church. They secure a pastor or select a leader from their own
number and continue their worship in a place where their notions are not in
conflict with other influences. Most frequently a minister formerly in the
South has come with or followed his migrant members and has re-established
his church in Chicago. Or again a group with religious beliefs and ceremonies
not in accord with those of established churches may establish a church of
its own. The groups are usually so small and the members so poor as to make
the purchase of a building impossible. The custom has been to engage a
small store and put chairs in it. Hence the name "store-front" church.

<p>
<i>Church property.</i>â€”It was not easy to determine the amount of money raised
and handled by the Negro churches for any specific period, because only the
better-organized churches keep accurate accounts.
</p>

<p>
The total value of the property holdings of twenty-six of the larger and
better-organized churches is $1,677,183.02, with a total indebtedness on
nineteen of them of $318,595.91. In twenty of the twenty-six annual collections
aggregate $226,216.25.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Out of 100 "store-front" churches visited only seven own or are buying the
property they use. The total value of the property of these seven churches is
$44,300. Four of the seven have an indebtedness of $7,300; and the four that
kept records showed a total annual collection of $5,170.
</p>

<p>
<i>The pastors.</i>â€”A sharp division both as to education and experience is
found between the pastors of the regular churches and those of the "store-front"
churches. Generally the larger churches have the better-trained,
more experienced, and more highly salaried ministers. Exceptions are found
in the case of one or two "holiness" churches.
</p>

<p>
The ministers in these various churches represent a range of training from
that of such seminaries as Newton Theological and institutions like Yale
University, University of Chicago, and Northwestern University, down to
that of the sixth grade in grammar school. Some have had no schooling at
all. The number of specially trained ministers totals twenty-one. Six of these
are graduates of recognized northern institutions, while fourteen are graduates
of recognized Negro institutions such as Lincoln University, Howard University,
Virginia Union University, and Livingston College. Four are graduates
of standard high schools and four of other high schools below the standard
rating. The remainder fall below the sixth grade. Among this last group
it is not unusual to hear that "God prepares a man to preach; he does not have
to go to school for that. All he must do is to open his mouth and God will
fill it. The universities train men away from the Bible."
</p>

<p>
The range of active service in the ministry is from two months to forty-four
years. Here again the larger established churches have the ministers of longer
service. Typical examples are found in churches like Bethel African Methodist
Episcopal Church, whose pastor has had forty-four years of service; Shiloh,
thirty-seven years; Bethesda Baptist Church, thirty-seven years; Grace
Presbyterian Church, thirty-two years (all at this one church); Original Providence,
thirty-five years; Berean Baptist Church, thirty years.
</p>

<h5>
4. SOCIAL AND CIVIC AGENCIES
</h5>

<p>
Social agencies in the Negro communities are an expression of group effort
to adjust itself to the larger community. Within the Negro community
there are two types, those especially for Negroes and those which are branches
of the agencies of the larger community but located conveniently for use by
Negroes.

<h6>
A. AGENCIES ESPECIALLY FOR NEGROES
</h6>

<p>
<i>Chicago Urban League.</i>â€”This organization is one of the thirty-two branches
of the National Urban League whose headquarters are in New York City.
It was established in Chicago in 1917 during the period of heaviest migration
of Negroes to the city. The numerous problems consequent upon this influx
guided the development of the League's activities. Its executive board and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
officers are whites and Negroes of high standing and influence in both the
white and Negro groups, and it is supported by voluntary subscriptions.
Within four years this organization has taken the leading place among all
the social agencies working especially among Negroes. It has a well-trained
staff of twelve paid workers, and its work is carried out along the lines accepted
in modern social work. The League has organized its activities as follows:
Administration Department, Industrial Department, Research and Records
Department, Children's Department, settlement work.
</p>

<p>
The work of the Administration Department involves, in addition to
general management, co-operation with other agencies and co-ordination of
their efforts for community improvement through interracial meetings,
conferences, and joint undertakings.
</p>

<p>
The Industrial Department during 1920 placed more than 15,000 Negroes
in positions, made industrial investigations in sixteen plants, provided lectures
for workingmen in plants and for foremen over Negro workers. It also
investigates complaints of workers, selects and fits men for positions, secures
positions for Negroes where Negroes have never worked before, and assists
in other ways the adjustment of Negroes in industry. More than 25,000
persons passed through the department during 1920.
</p>

<p>
The Department of Research and Records makes the investigations on
the basis of which the programs of the League are carried out. Its information
is a permanent and growing body of material useful to all agencies and persons
interested in obtaining reliable information concerning Negroes in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
The Children's Department handles cases of boys and girls and co-operates
with the schools, juvenile protective organizations, the juvenile court and
probation department, and various other child-helping institutions. A total
of 540 such cases were adjusted during 1920.
</p>

<p>
During 1919 a total of $28,659 was raised and used in the support of the
Chicago Urban League.
</p>

<p>
The Wendell Phillips Settlement on the West Side is under the supervision
of the League. The settlement has a day nursery and provides a center and
leadership for twenty-five groups in the West Side community.
</p>

<p>
<i>Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A.</i>â€”This organization is a branch of the local
Young Men's Christian Association, but because of its location and the
peculiar social problems of its membership and vicinity, it has become one of
the strongest agencies of the community. Its work is among boys and young
men, many of whom are industrial workers in various plants. Community
work is vigorously promoted. In 1920 an enthusiastic group of 1,137 boys was
enlisted in a neighborhood clean-up campaign, and 100 community gardens
were put in operation. Moving pictures and community singing were provided
during the summer months. The following list gives some statistics of activities
for the first nine months of 1920.

In addition to the foregoing work this institution has promoted efficiency
and industrial clubs among Negro workers in industrial plants, three glee
clubs, noonday recreational programs, and nine baseball teams.
</p>

<p>
During 1919 the total contributions for support were $15,353, of which
$3,100 came from Negroes. The membership dues of the latter, however,
totaled $16,000 and receipts from operation amounted to $143,747.

<p>
<i>Chicago Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.</i>â€”This organization aims to carry out the general policies of the National
Association as far as they apply to Chicago. The national purpose is to
combat injustice against Negroes, stamp out race discriminations, prevent
lynchings, burnings, and torturings of Negroes, and, when they do occur, to
demand the prosecution of those responsible, to assure to every citizen of color
the common rights of an American citizen, and secure for colored children
equal opportunity in public-school education.
</p>

<p>
In Chicago, the principal efforts of this organization have been in the line
of securing justice for Negroes in the courts and opposing race discriminations
in public accommodations. Its most active period followed the riots of 1919.
With a number of competent attorneys, white and Negro, it gave legal support
to Negro riot victims and followed through the courts the cases of many Negroes
accused of participation in rioting.

</p>

<h6>
D. SUPPORT OF INSTITUTIONS BY NEGROES
</h6>

<p>
Social agencies, although their work is limited as respects the Negro group,
have for many years taken second place to the churches in self-support. This
is accounted for largely by the fact that social work in general has been regarded
as a philanthropic rather than a co-operative matter. With Negro social
and philanthropic agencies, especially during the period of general unsettlement
following the migration, the number of possible beneficiaries greatly increased,
while the group of Negroes educated in giving to such agencies grew more
slowly. Recently, however, support from Negroes for their own institutions
has gradually been increasing. An example is found in the Urban League.
In 1917 Negroes contributed $1,000 and in 1919 $3,000. During 1920 six
social agencies and twenty-seven churches raised among Negroes approximately
$445,000. Although Negroes contribute in some measure to agencies like the
United Charities and American Red Cross, there is no means of knowing or
accurately estimating the amount.

CHAPTER V
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE NEGRO HOUSING PROBLEM</span>
</h2>

<h3>
A. A STUDY OF NEGRO FAMILIES
</h3>

<p>
Consideration of the housing problem as a continuing factor in the experience
of Negro families led to an effort to study it from a new angle of approachâ€”through
histories of typical families in the Negro community.
</p>

<p>
The data thus gathered afford an opportunity to present an interpretative
account of Negro family life, setting forth the intimate problems confronting
Negroes in Chicago, their daily social difficulties, the reflection in their home life
of their struggle for existence, just how they live, how they participate in the
activities of the Negro community and the community at large, their own
opinions concerning civic problems, their housing experience, how much they
earn and how much they save, how much they spend and what value they
receive from these expenditures, how they spend their spare time, and how
they seek to improve their condition in the community.
</p>

<p>
A selection was made of 274 Negro families living in all sections of Chicago.
Three Negro women, well equipped to deal intelligently and sympathetically
with these families, gathered this information. These 274 families lived in
238 blocks, the distribution being such that no type of neighborhood or division
of the Negro population was overlooked. The questionnaire employed contained
five pages of questions and required an interview of about two hours.
Special effort was made to secure purely social information without the aid
of leading questions.
</p>

<h4>
I. GENERAL LIVING CONDITIONS
</h4>

<p>
For the most part the physical surroundings of the Negro family, as
indicated by these family histories, are poor. The majority of these houses
fall within the classifications noted as Types "C" and "D" in the discussion
of the physical condition of housing.<a name='FA_22' id='FA_22' href='#FN_22' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a>
</p>

<p>
On the South Side, where most of the Negro population lives, the low
quality of housing is widespread, although there are some houses of a better
grade which are greatly in demand.
</p>

<p>
The ordinary conveniences, considered necessities by the average white
citizen, are often lacking. Bathrooms are often missing. Gas lighting is
common, and electric lighting is a rarity. Heating is commonly done by wood
or coal stoves, and furnaces are rather exceptional; when furnaces are present,
they are sometimes out of commission.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Under the heading of "Housing Conditions" such notations as these are
often found:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

No gas, bath, or toilet. Plumbing very bad; toilet leaks; bowl broken; leak in
kitchen sink; water stands in kitchen; leak in bath makes ceiling soggy and wet all
the time. Plastering off in front room. General appearance very bad inside and out.
Had to get city behind owner to put in windows, clean, and repair plumbing. Heat
poor; house damp. Plumbing bad; leaks. Hot-water heater out of order. Needs
repairing done to roof and floors. In bad repair; toilet in yard used by two families.
Toilet off from dining-room; fixtures for gas; no gas; just turned off; no bath;
doors out of order; won't fasten. Sanitary conditions poor; dilapidated condition;
toilet won't flush; carries water to bathtub. Plumbing bad; roof leaks; plastering
off; no bath or gas; general repairs needed; very dirty. Plumbing bad; plastering
off in toilet; window panes broken and out; no bath or gas. Plastering off from water
that leaks from flat above; toilet leaks; does not flush; washbowl and bath leak
very badly; repairs needed on back porch; rooms need calcimining. No water in
hydrant in hall; no toilet, bath, or gas; general repair needed. Water not turned on
for sink in kitchen; water for drinking and cooking purposes must be carried in; toilet
used by four families; asked landlord to turn on water in kitchen; told them to move;
roof leaks; stairs and back porch in bad order. Sewer gas escapes from basement
pipes; water stands in basement. House dirty; flues in bad condition; gas pipes
leak; porch shaky. No heat and no hot water; no repairing done; no screens; gas
leaks all over house; stationary tubs leak. Water pipes rotted out; gas pipes leak.
Toilet leaks; plastering off; windowpanes out. Plastering off; large rat holes all
over; paper hanging from ceiling.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is the common situation of the dweller in the districts mentioned.
The variations are in degree rather than kind. To dwellings a little better
in sanitation and repair than those just described, the adjective "fair" was
given.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally a Negro family manages to escape from this wretched type
of dwelling in the "Black Belt." Some who were financially able purchased
homes in Woodlawn, for example, where they live much as white residents do,
supplied with the comforts and conveniences of life and in fairly clean, wholesome
surroundings. There, as a rule, the physical equipment of their dwellings
is good and is kept in repair. In some instances they have hot-water heating,
electric lighting, and gas for cooking purposes. They ordinarily redecorate
once a year, take proper care of their garbage, keep the lawns cut and the
premises clean; and otherwise reveal a natural and normal pride of ownership.
</p>

<p>
In this respect the Negro residents of Woodlawn are far more fortunate
than many of their race brothers who have purchased dwellings in the "Black
Belt." Many of these purchases have been made by migrants on long-time
payments, and large expenditure would be required to put the houses in repair
and keep them so. Purchases made by Negroes in Woodlawn have been chiefly
of substantial dwellings, not necessarily new but in good condition and needing
only ordinary repairs from time to time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
</p>

<h4>
II. WHY NEGROES MOVE
</h4>

<p>
Except where the property is owned by Negroes there is frequent moving.
The records obtained of these movements give a great variety of reasons.
A strong desire to improve living conditions appears with sufficient frequency
to indicate that it is the leading motive. Buying a home is one of the ways
of escape from intolerable living conditions, but removal to other houses or
flats is more often tried. For example, a man who now owns his home near
Fifty-first Street and South Wabash Avenueâ€”living there with his two brothers
and five lodgersâ€”has moved six times, "to live in a better house and a better
neighborhood." A family now living near Thirty-first Street and Prairie
Avenue, resident in Chicago since 1893, has moved four times, three times to
obtain better houses in better neighborhoods and once to get nearer to work.
A man and wife living near Fifty-third and South Dearborn streets have moved
four times since coming to Chicago in 1908. A family living on East Forty-fifth
Street and paying $60 a month rent for six rooms has moved twice since
1900 to "better and cleaner houses." Another family paying $65 a month
for eight rooms on East Bowen Avenue has moved twice since 1905 into
better houses and neighborhoods. "Better house" and "better neighborhood"
were the most frequently given reasons.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Of kindred nature are these: leaky roof; house cold; dirty; inconvenient; did
not like living in rear flat; to better conditions; better houses away from questionable
places; landlord would not clean; first floor not healthy; small and undesirable;
not desirable flat; poor plumbing; didn't like neighborhood; moved to better quarters;
landlord would not repair; house too damp; no windows; owner would not
fix water pipes; more room wanted; better environment for children; better street;
no yard for children; better people; house in bad condition; more conveniences for
roomers.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
III. THE FAMILY GROUPING
</h4>

<p>
The normal family is generally recognized as consisting of five personsâ€”two
parents and three children. Properly they should make up a single
group and live by themselves. The 274 families studied were chosen as
follows: in the most populous district, from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth
streets and from Wentworth Avenue to Lake Michigan, ninety-nine family
histories were taken; in the district north of Thirty-first Street to Twelfth
Street and from Wentworth Avenue to the Lake, forty-six; in the narrow
strip in Hyde Park known as the Lake Park district, thirty-seven; in the district
from Thirty-ninth to Sixtieth streets and from Wentworth to Cottage Grove
Avenue, thirty-six; on the West Side, sixteen; in the Ogden Park district,
fifteen; on the North Side, fourteen; and in Woodlawn, eleven. For convenience,
as well as to show contrasts or like conditions, the material has been
analyzed and interpreted by districts.

</table>
<p>
There was found a wide variation in the family groups, comprising six
classifications, in three of which no lodgers appear. A lodger here means
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
an adult not a member of the immediate family. Thus relatives, unless
infants or children, are classed as lodgers. The three groups without lodgers
are: (1) man and wife; (2) two parents and children; (3) a parent and children.
The other three groups with lodgers are: (1<i>a</i>) man and wife and lodgers;
(2<i>a</i>) man, wife, children, and lodgers; (3<i>a</i>) man or woman, surviving head of
the family, with lodgers.
</p>

<p>
Of the total 274 family groups there were 104 without lodgers and 170,
or 62 per cent, with lodgers. For the most part the lodgers were found in
"2<i>a</i>" classificationâ€”in families. There were ninety-two such groups and only
sixty-one families with no lodgers. Forty-two couples had lodgers, and in
thirty-six instances a man or woman living alone had lodgers. Thirty-nine
couples were living alone, and in only four instances was there a parent alone
with a child.
</p>

<p>
The Negro colony in Woodlawn approaches most nearly the normal
family grouping. Home ownership in that district is fairly common, and the
houses for the most part are substantial and well fitted and suited to the
families. In the eleven Woodlawn families there was but one where the mother
or father was dead or not living with the family. Lodgers were found in only
four of the eleven families: two were couples, one a family, and the other a
single woman. In the eleven families there were seventeen children.
</p>

<p>
A marked contrast with this section is found in the congested Negro
district between Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth streets. Out of a total of
ninety-nine families seventy-two had lodgers, or 72 per cent as contrasted
with 36 per cent in Woodlawn and 62 per cent for the total 274 cases. In
this district there were forty-two families with children, thirteen couples
without children, and seventeen where a man or woman took lodgers. There
were only fourteen families without lodgers, and thirteen couples living
alone.
</p>

<p>
North of Thirty-first Street in this South Side area were similar conditions.
Of forty-six households studied, twenty-seven, or 58.7 per cent, had lodgers:
of these sixteen were families with children, nine were couples and two were
man or woman with children. Of the households without lodgers, there were
twelve families with children, five couples living alone, and two instances of
parent and child.
</p>

<p>
The percentage of families with lodgers was highest in the Lake Park
district, 75.6 per cent. On the West Side it was 68 per cent, a trifle higher
than for the entire 274 families. On the North Side it was 57 per cent, on
the South Side between Thirty-ninth and Sixtieth streets, 41.6 per cent, and
in the Ogden Park district 40 per cent.
</p>

<p>
The Ogden Park district, with a relatively low percentage of families having
lodgers, resembles the Woodlawn district in many respects. The houses are
built for single families and are largely owned by Negroes who have lived in
that locality for many years. Of the fifteen families there visited, nine had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
no lodgers; and of the seven with lodgers, four were families and two were
couples without children.
</p>

<p>
<i>Room crowding.</i>â€”A study of Negro housing made in 1909 by the Chicago
School of Civics and Philanthropy brought out the fact that, although Negro
families find it extremely difficult to obtain a flat of three or four rooms,
they do not crowd together as much as white immigrants; that Negroes take
larger flats or houses and rent rooms to lodgers to help pay the rent, and thus
lessen crowding among the members of the family. Among the 274 families
studied by the Commission there was comparatively little overcrowding.
One room to a person is a standard of room occupancy generally accepted by
housing authorities as involving no overcrowding. Of these 274 Negro
households, only sixty-seven exceeded the standard. There were, of course,
wide divergences from the standard. For example, there were eight instances
of six persons living in five rooms; six of eight persons living in six rooms;
four of six persons living in four rooms; one of six persons living in three rooms;
one of seven persons living in three rooms; two of seven persons living in four
rooms; two of eight persons living in five rooms; one of nine persons living
in five rooms; and one of eleven persons living in five rooms.
</p>

<p>
In the cases of unusually large families, either in the number of children or
lodgers, there was a corresponding increase in the number of rooms. Thus in
the case of fourteen persons making up one family, they were living in ten rooms.
</p>

<p>
The five-room dwelling was the most common, with fifty-nine families; six-room,
forty-seven; seven-room, forty-two; four-room, forty-one.
</p>

<p>
In the Ogden Park district the standard of one person to one room was
most closely adhered to. All the fifteen families studied in that district were
housed in four-, five-, or six-room dwellings; ten of them in five-room dwellings.
In Woodlawn the tendency was toward somewhat larger dwellings. There
were no four- and five-room dwellings, but five of seven rooms and three of six
rooms, one each of eight and three rooms. The four-room dwelling was most
prevalent on the North Side. Of the fourteen families studied there, six were
in such dwellings. There were two dwellings of six rooms, two of seven,
one of five, two of three, and one of eleven rooms.
</p>

<p>
On the West Side, also, thirteen of the sixteen families were housed in four-,
five-, six-, or seven-room dwellings, the five-room type predominating. In the
Lake Park district the five-room type was most frequent, there being eleven
of these out of a total of thirty-seven, six of six rooms and seven of seven rooms,
the next largest group being five of eight rooms.
</p>

<p>
On the South Side in the district from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth Street,
out of a total of ninety-nine there were eighteen families in five-room dwellings,
seventeen in four-room, nine in three-room, ten in six-room, fourteen in seven-room,
and eight in ten-room dwellings. In the district north of Thirty-first
Street the predominating size was six-room dwellings, of which there were
eleven, and there were nine of four rooms, seven of five rooms, and seven of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
seven rooms, the rest scattering from one-room dwellings to one dwelling of
thirteen rooms. From Thirty-ninth to Sixtieth streets, six-room dwellings
were most frequent, there being eight of these out of a total of thirty-six, and
there were seven of five rooms, six of six rooms, and six of seven rooms. The
dwellings occupied by Negroes south of Thirty-ninth Street, it should be
noticed, are larger than those north of that street.

<p>
Four persons to a "family" was the most common type, there being forty-eight
of these out of the 274. In the Woodlawn and Ogden Park districts
the group of three was predominant. The North Side district grouping of
two persons to a family is partly due to the inclusion of nine "groups" of one
person each who were interviewed mainly for data bearing upon industrial
relationships. The tables show a total of sixteen such groups in the eight
districts; but they are not deemed sufficient to vitiate the statistics.
</p>

<p>
Negroes have more space in their living quarters than do other Chicago
people housed in similar grades of dwellings. They were usually found in
dwellings of five rooms for each family, while the prevailing size among the
foreign groups was four rooms, as disclosed by the Chicago School of Civics
housing studies from 1909 to 1917. In the School's earliest study of the
Negroes it was said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The colored families do not as a rule live in the small and cramped apartments in
which other nationalities are so often found. Even the families who apply to the
United Charities for relief are frequently living in apartments which would be considered
adequate, as far as the number of rooms is concerned, for families in comfortable
circumstances.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Some marked exceptions, of course, were found.
</p>

<p>
The four-room dwelling was found to prevail among the Slovaks of the
Twentieth Ward, the Lithuanians of the Fourth Ward, the Greeks and Italians
in the neighborhood of Hull-House, the various central and southern European
nationalities who work in the South Chicago steel mills and live near-by,
and among the Jews, Bohemians, and Poles of the West Side.

</p>

<p>
<i>The lodger problem.</i>â€”The prevalence of lodgers is one of the most conspicuous
problems in the Negro housing situation. It is largely a social question.
The difficulty of finding a home adequate for a family of four or five persons
at a reasonable rent has forced many Negroes to take over large buildings
in better localities and in better physical condition but with much higher rents.
To meet these rents they have taken lodgers. It was seldom possible to
investigate the character of the lodgers. The arrangement of these large
houses, originally intended for single-family use, prevents family privacy
when lodgers are added, making a difficult situation for families with children.
Again, the migration brought to the city many unattached men and women
who could find no other place to live except in families. Thus it happens that
in Negro families the lodger problem is probably more pressing than in any
other group of the community. Not only do lodgers constitute a social
problem for the family, but, having little or no interest in the appearance
and condition of the property, they are in many instances careless and irresponsible
and contribute to the rapid deterioration of the buildings.
</p>

<p>
As previously explained, the term "lodgers," in this report, includes
relations as well as other adults unrelated to the family. It was apparent in
the study that there was a large number of relative-lodgers in Negro families.
The recent migration from the South had a distinct bearing on this situation.
Many Negroes came to Chicago at the solicitation of relatives and remained
in their households until they could secure homes for themselves. The migration
further accounts for the accentuation of the lodger problem during the
period immediately following it. The 274 family histories include 1,319
persons, of whom 485, or 35 per cent, were lodgers, living in 62 per cent of the
households. The greatest number of households with lodgers were those
living in five-room dwellings. There were thirty-eight such households.
Living in six-and seven-room dwellings were thirty-four families with lodgers.
Families with only one lodger were most numerous. There were fifty-five
such families as compared with thirty-nine having two lodgers, twenty-five
with three lodgers, twenty-three with four lodgers, thirteen with six lodgers,
eight with five lodgers, and seven with more than six lodgers.
</p>

<p>
Naturally the lodger evil was found in its worst form in the congested
parts of the South Side. In the district from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth
streets seventy-two of the ninety-nine families had lodgers. In twenty-two
families there was but one, however, as against twelve with three and four,
eleven with two, and six with five and six lodgers. Two families had ten each,
and one had thirteen. This last case was that of a widow who rented nine
sleeping-rooms in her ten-room house, in addition to catering at odd moments.
It was a typical rooming-house as distinguished from a family taking lodgers.
One family that had ten lodgers consisted of a man, his wife, and a son twenty-five
years old; they had eight bedrooms, seven opening into a hall. The other
family that had ten lodgers consisted of the parents and two children, a boy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
of eight and a girl of seven, and had a ten-room house. The lodgers were
two men and three women, with five children. Five of the ten rooms were
used as sleeping-rooms.
</p>

<p>
In the district north of Thirty-first Street an increased number of lodgers
appeared in only one family, that of a man and his wife, without children.
They lived in a ten-room house, using eight of the rooms for sleeping purposes
and accommodating seven male and five female lodgers.
</p>

<p>
In the district from Thirty-ninth to Sixtieth Street was one instance of
seven male lodgers in a seven-room house with the man who owned the property.
Two of the lodgers were his brothers. There was no heat and no
bathroom. The house had been reported to the health department.
</p>

<p>
In the Lake Park district one, two, or three lodgers were the rule, only
five of the twenty-eight families with lodgers in that district being outside of
those three classes. Eight lodgers were found in an eight-room dwelling.
The family consisted of man and wife, and the only female lodger was their
niece. Five rooms were used for sleeping purposes.
</p>

<p>
In the other district no instances of excessive overcrowding due to lodgers
were found.
</p>

<p>
Complaint has often been made of the numerical preponderance of lodgers
over children among Chicago Negroes, and comment has been made on the
economic significance. It has been suggested, for example, that economic
pressure had lowered the birth-rate among Negroes and increased the infant-mortality
rate. As indicated by the 274 family histories, the number of lodgers
among the Negro population exceeds the number of children, that is, the number
of boys less than twenty-one years and girls less than eighteen. The School of
Civics and Philanthropy, in its housing studies, counted as children those less
than twelve years of age. On this basis it found in its study of the Negroes
of the South and West sides that there were less than half as many children
as lodgers on the South Side, but a more normal situation in the West Side.
Even extending the ages of children, as has been done in the present report,
the situation does not appear in a much better light.
</p>

The proportion of lodgers and of children in the districts covered by the
Commission is shown in Table IX.

<p>
By way of comparison similar figures from other housing studies of the
Chicago School of Civics might be mentioned, the children in each instance
being less than twelve years old.
</p>

<p>
Among the Slovaks of the Twentieth Ward, 13 per cent were lodgers and
32 per cent children; in South Chicago, 27.3 per cent lodgers and 25.7 per cent
children; among the Greeks and Italians near Hull-House, 13 per cent lodgers
and 30 per cent children; among the Lithuanians of the Fourth Ward, 28 per
cent lodgers and 27 per cent children.
</p>

<p>
As far as the South Side is concerned, the situation with regard to the
balance between lodgers and children has become aggravated since the earliest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
School of Civics report was issued, whereas the situation on the West Side
has improved somewhat.
</p>

<p>
Where there were children and lodgers together, a considerable number of
instances were found which suggest probable injury to health or morals,
and sometimes both. Even where lodgers are relatives, impairment of health
and morals is threatened in certain circumstances, especially if the over-crowding
is flagrant. For example, a household on South Dearborn Street
near Thirty-fourth Street consisted of a father, mother, a son of nineteen
years, and a baby girl of four months, with three lodgers, two men and one
womanâ€”seven persons living in seven rooms and sleeping in all parts of the
house. One of the lodgers was a sister-in-law, another a nephew by marriage,
and the third, a stranger, had a bedroom to himself. In a ten-room house in
East Thirty-second Street parents having a boy of eight years and a girl of
seven years were found to have taken in ten lodgers, two of whom were men.
In another instance five children, four of them boys of eight, five, four, and two
years and a girl of eleven, lived with their parents and two lodgers in a six-room
house.
</p>

<p>
In Ogden Park, a district which shows a high percentage of children,
lodgers sometimes are added to the family. In one house of five rooms, for
example, there were found living twelve personsâ€”father, mother, two sons,
sixteen and seventeen years of age, four daughters, thirty-three, twenty-four,
twenty-two, and thirteen years of age, and four lodgersâ€”a daughter, her
husband, and their two infants. There were only two bedrooms for the
twelve persons. Another instance was that of a family of father, mother,
four sons, nine, five, three, and two years, and two daughters, seven years and
three weeks, with a sister of one of the parents for a lodger. The nine persons
lived in five rooms. There were only two beds in the house, and one of the
bedrooms was not in use.
</p>

<p>
On the South Side near Thirty-first Street there was a case where a man
lodger occupied one bedroom, the other being used by the parents and their
eight-year-old daughterâ€”four persons in a four-room flat. On South Park
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
Avenue near Twenty-ninth Street two lodgers, a son-in-law and a nephew,
occupied two of the six rooms, while the husband and wife, a son of twenty-three
years, and a daughter of twenty-one years lived in the other four rooms,
which included the kitchen and dining-room. A similar instance was found,
on Indiana Avenue near Thirtieth Street, where two male lodgers lived with
a family consisting of the parents, a son of twenty, and a daughter of eighteen,
all in six rooms, two of which were not sleeping-rooms. On Lake Park Avenue
near Fifty-sixth Street a family, including father, mother, and daughter of
twenty, slept in the kitchen in order that three lodgers, one male and two female,
might be accommodated in the five-room flat. In a five-room flat on Kenwood
Avenue near Fifty-third Street the two male lodgers occupied both bedrooms,
while the mother and her boy of nine and girl of seven years lived in the kitchen
and dining-room. Seven persons were found living in a six-room house on
East Fortieth Street; they were father, mother, a son of five years, a daughter
of seven years, and an infant, with a male and a female lodger, friends of the
parents. Virtually the whole house was used for sleeping purposes.
</p>

<p>
These are examples of the arrangements that sometimes occur when
children and lodgers are found in the same dwelling. The fact that in the
main Chicago Negroes live in more rooms per dwelling than immigrants,
whose standard of living has not yet risen, does not necessarily mean that the
Negroes have a greater appreciation of a house with more rooms. The explanation
in many cases is that the Negroes take whatever living quarters happen
to be available, which often are large residences abandoned by well-to-do
whites, and then adapt their mode of living to the circumstances. Lodgers
are one of the sources of revenue that aid in paying the rent. Negro families
often expressed a desire to live by themselves if they could find a dwelling of
suitable size for reasonable rent. They sometimes complained of lodgers
and declared that they would prefer not to take them at all, especially women
lodgers. The objection to married couples and unattached men was not so
pronounced.
</p>

<p>
Smaller houses thus would seem to be a factor in the solution of the lodger
problem. A Negro real estate dealer was asked if the Negro was as contented
or as much disposed to live in a cottage as white people, or whether he wanted
to live in spacious quarters where he could draw a revenue from roomers.
The reply was that the Negro would rather live by himself. This is
evidenced by the fact that many Negroes would rather live in an apartment
and rent two or three rooms than take a large house and have it full of roomers.
</p>

<p>
Lodgers are often found in the smaller dwellings occupied by Negroes.
Rent is often the determining factor in the selection of the smaller dwelling.
When it is so high that it forms too large a proportion of income, economic
necessity often drives the Negro family to admit one or more lodgers at the
expense of overcrowding and its attendant harmfulness. This was noted in
certain districts where the dwellings as a rule were small.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Rents and lodgers.</i>â€”An effort was made to determine the economic necessity
for lodgers as expressed by the relation of the wages of heads of families to
the amounts of rent paid. It is assumed that in a normal family budget
rent should not exceed one-fifth of the income of the head of the family. Wide
variations from that proportion were revealed.
</p>

<p>
Facts as to both rent and wages were difficult to secure, owing to the
variable earnings of various members of the family, variable sums received
from lodgers, and other factors. For example, seventeen occupants owned
their houses. In seventy-eight other cases information obtained by the
investigators was not adequate or could not, for various reasons, be used in
calculations.
</p>

<p>
The remaining 179 cases out of the 274 provided data from which the
following facts are presented: In three instances the rent exceeded the income
of the head of the family; in thirty-one instances the rent equaled one-half
the income of the head of the family, and in an equal number it amounted
to one-third. In one case the rent was equal to three-fourths of the income,
and in twenty-three cases the rent equaled one-fourth. Thus eighty-nine
instances were disclosed in which the rent was in excess of one-fifth of the
income of the head of the family. In most of these cases, particularly the
extreme ones, the income of the head of the family was greatly supplemented
by money received from lodgers or from earnings of other members of the
family.
</p>

<p>
The remaining ninety families in which the rent amounted to one-fifth
or less of the income of the head of the family were divided as follows: Twenty-four
fell in the one-fifth column, twenty-seven in the one-sixth column, fourteen
in the one-seventh column, eleven in the one-eighth column, while fourteen
were in the "low" column. The last named included those ranging from
one-ninth to one-twenty-third.
</p>

<p>
On the South Side, in the district from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth Street,
rents exceeded the one-fifth proportion in one-half of the sixty-two families
studied, two of them paying rent in excess of income, eight paying one-half of
income for rent, fourteen paying one-third, and seven paying one-fourth.
Of the remaining thirty-one families in that district, seven fell in the one-fifth
column, twelve in the one-sixth column, six in the one-seventh column, four
in the one-eighth column and two in the "low," being one-ninth and one-eleventh.
</p>

<p>
Rents were high also in the Lake Park district, where twenty-five families
of a total of thirty-six were paying in excess of the one-fifth proportion. Fourteen
of these paid one-half of the income for rent, five paid one-fourth, four
paid one-third, one paid three-quarters, and in one instance rent exceeded
income. In only five instances was the normal one-fifth paid, two paid one-sixth,
two paid one-seventh, while two paid one-ninth and one-eleventh
respectively.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In the district north of Thirty-first Street, eighteen out of a total of thirty-eight
families paid in excess of the one-fifth proportion, four paid one-half,
nine paid one-third, and five paid one-fourth. Six families paid the normal
one-fifth, five paid one-sixth, two paid one-seventh, one one-eighth, and six less
than that, running as low as one-twenty-third.
</p>

<p>
The Ogden Park area was found to be a district of low rents. None of
the eight families studied paid as much as the normal one-fifth. Two paid
one-sixth, one paid one-seventh, three one-eighth, one one-ninth, and one
one-twelfth.
</p>

<p>
The other districts did not show much variation from the normal proportion.
</p>

<p>
Examination was made of all the factors in instances where the rent equaled
one-half or more of the income of the head of the family or amounted to
one-third. With regard to the former it was assumed, for the purpose of the
study, that it compelled renting rooms to lodgers. With regard to the one-third
column, lodgers were assumed to be an economic necessity when they
offered the only source of income in addition to that of the head of the family.
On these bases it was found that in forty-six families supplementary income
afforded by lodgers was necessary, that in three instances they were the sole
source of the income, while one instance was presented of a widow whose
children partly supported her, but insufficiently for their common needs.
</p>

<p>
While in most instances of high rents and low income on the part of the
head of the family good reason appeared for taking lodgers, in not a few
instances further analysis revealed other sources of income which might
indicate that there was no economic necessity for lodgers. There was one
instance on Forest Avenue, for example, where the relation of the rent to the
father's income was one-third, but where his sons earned more than double
his income. In another family on South State Street near Thirtieth Street,
the father earned $125 a month and paid $50 a month rent, but additional
income was derived from the wife, son, and daughter, in addition to that
obtained from lodgers. There was likewise the case of a waiter living on
Lake Park Avenue whose rent was $30 a month as against wages of $10 a
week. In addition to the tips he doubtless received in his work, his wife
earned $18 a week, and $6 a week was derived from lodgers. In one instance
a man living near Fifty-sixth Street and Wabash Avenue paid rent equal to
one-third of his wages, but had considerable income from investments.
</p>

<p>
Such instances tend to explain why only forty-eight families were found
in which lodgers seemed to be an economic necessity in aiding to pay rents,
when eighty-nine cases were revealed in which the rent was in excess of one-fifth
of the wages of the head of the family. The family histories also showed
that various means besides lodgers supplemented the insufficient income of a
family head. In some cases the wife or children worked, and not infrequently
their incomes exceeded those of the father.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Lodgers were often found in families where the income from that source
did not appear to be needed. This was the case in a number of families with
unusually high wages and abnormally low rents. High wages and low rents
explain most of the cases shown where the rent ranges from one-ninth to
one-twenty-third of the income of the head of the family. In the one-twenty-third
case the couple lived in two rooms on South State Street for which they
paid $6 a month. The man earned $35 a week in an iron foundry, while the
wife added $18 a week to the common fund. Another instance was that of
a man who paid $16 a month rent and earned $48 weekly at the Stock Yards.
His wife and a relative added $23.60 a week to the family income. A man in
Ogden Park whose income as a contractor was $48 a week paid $16 a month
rent. A man living on the West Side earned $48 a week and paid $15 a month
rent. His children added $43.50 a week to the family income.
</p>

<p>
Even in circumstances such as these, lodgers were sometimes taken.
In one case where the rent was one-tenth of the wages of the head of the family
the man paid $15 a month rent for a five-room dwelling out of his $36 weekly
wages earned in a coke plant at Gary. His son and lodgers increased the
monthly income by $28. There was a teamster earning $30 a week who
paid $15 a month rent for a six-room dwelling in which nine persons lived.
The proportion of rent to his wages was as one to eight. His wife, one of his
children, and lodgers added to the income. As in numerous instances where
the income was high, a large amount was spent for food in this family.
</p>

<p>
An instance was found of a man earning $9.50 to $10.50 a day. His wife
was a caterer. There was a daughter of fifteen years. They took three
roomers. There was no need for the woman to work, but she said she wanted
the money. She was a good cook, having served in that capacity in the South,
and she said she earned $15 when she went out for a week-end of catering.
In this instance there seemed to be little need for lodgers.
</p>

<p>
Another case was that of a man and his wife and two grown children
living in a nine-room dwelling on Calumet Avenue and having nine lodgers.
The man was earning $40 a week, and the lodgers paid $33.50 a week. The
wife occasionally did day work, earning $3.65 a day. The monthly expenditure
for food was $100, clothing $33, and rent $60.
</p>

<p>
Another instance was that of a widow with three children who lived on
State Street near Thirty-seventh Street, in a three-room flat. Though the
children's earnings amounted to $78 a week, the inevitable lodger was present,
contributing $4 a week to the common fund. This little family spent $120
a month for food.
</p>

<p>
Large amounts spent for food were not uncommon in some families that
took lodgers. A typical instance was that of the man and wife with three
children and two lodgers who lived on Prairie Avenue. The man earned
$25 a week, while $82 a month was derived from the lodgers. Food for the
family alone cost $100 a month.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A man on North Wells Street earned $57 a week for the support of his
wife and three adopted children. They lived in an eleven-room house which
also accommodated the man's sister and brother. One of the sons earned
$75 a week, and the lodgers paid $45 a month. This family spent $180 a
month for food. Another earned $22 a week in the Stock Yards. Besides
his wife and child they had in their nine-room house on East Thirtieth
Street six lodgers paying $20 a week. This family spent $100 a month for
food and $34 for clothing. Another man and wife on Forest Avenue paid
$25 a month rent and spent $88 a month for food and $43 for clothing. They
derived $3.75 a week from their two lodgers. A similar case was that of a family
which lived on East Thirty-second Street. The man earned $30 a week in
a foundry. He and his wife have one child, and they had ten lodgers, who
paid $72 a week. In this family $80 was spent for food each month and $50
for clothing.
</p>

<p>
The heaviest expenditure for food in any one family was $330 a month.
This was explained by the fact that there were twenty table boarders. The
husband earned $22.50 a week, and there were three lodgers who paid $13 a
week. The boarders collectively paid $13 a day. Rent was $55 a month,
and $25 a month was spent for clothing.
</p>

<p>
Other reasons for the ready acceptance of lodgers in Negro dwellings
were apparent, among them friendship and the desire to be obliging and to
assist others in a new environment. Most Negroes would regard it as a breach
of good faith to encourage friends and relatives to come to Chicago from the
South and then fail to help them after their arrival. This accounts for the
frequent designation of "relatives" and "friends" among the lodgers. Sometimes
these lodgers seemed to be permanent, but often they were taken only
until they could adjust themselves.
</p>

<p>
During the period of greatest migration, 1915-20, hundreds of unattached
men and women could be seen on the streets as late as one or two o'clock in
the morning, seeking rooms shortly after their arrival in Chicago. One
instance was reported of a family to whose house four men came at midnight
looking for rooms. Lack of lodging-houses or of hotels where accommodations
could be had at reasonable prices was partly responsible for this swarm of
migrants seeking shelter in private homes. The meager provision of such
places for the accommodation of unattached Negroes has been a factor in the
lodger problem.
</p>

<h4>
IV. HOW NEGRO FAMILIES LIVE
</h4>

<p>
How Negroes earn their living in Chicago, what occupational changes
those from the South have undergone since arrival, how their present occupations
differ from those in their former homesâ€”information on all these points
was gained from the family histories. Almost without exception, the Negroes
interviewed declared that their economic situation had improved in Chicago.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
In most instances they were able to earn more; some said they were obliged
to work harder but felt well recompensed because of their improved economic
condition.
</p>

<p>
From the occupations of persons included in the study it appears that
there is a distinct departure from the domestic and personal service in which
Negroes were commonly found a few years ago. Among the 274 families
visited, the heads of 225 families were men. Of this number eighteen were
idle at the time of the investigation, in the summer of 1920, nine were professional
men, nineteen were in business, twenty-two were in some skilled trade
or work, 110 were doing unskilled work, and only forty-seven were engaged
in personal service. The latter term includes such occupations as doorman
in a hotel or club, bellboy, bootblack, cook, waiter, porter, elevator operator,
and chauffeurs who lack training as mechanics. These are chiefly functions
which bring employees in contact with the public or with white employers
in a more or less personal capacity.
</p>

<p>
Before coming to Chicago, forty-five of the 225 were farmers. Practically
all of these entered the field of unskilled occupations here. Only sixty-four
of the 225 had been doing unskilled work in their former home. Six more did
skilled work in their former homes than were doing such work in Chicago;
two more were in personal service; two less were in business; and one more was
in a profession.
</p>

<p>
Of these 225 family heads, 122 migrated to Chicago, chiefly from the South,
during the period from 1916 to 1920 inclusive. Three periods in the industrial
history of the family head were taken: (1) occupation in the former home;
(2) occupation on first arrival in Chicago; and (3) adjustment to new conditions
in Chicago and occupation at the time of investigation, during the spring and
early summer of 1920.
</p>

<p>
Many of these migrants had not yet made their adjustment to the new
occupations at that time. However, certain tendencies were manifest. For
example, in the former home thirty-one were farmers and forty-five were
unskilled workers. In the period of adjustment seventy-seven were doing
unskilled work. The unskilled occupations had apparently, in the shifting
about, absorbed the farmers. The difficulty of continuing in skilled occupations
in the North was evidenced. In the South fourteen of the 122 men
were engaged in skilled occupations of some sort; in the period of adjustment
there were fifteen; but at the time of the investigation there were but twelve.
</p>

<p>
In the South nineteen of the 122 were in personal-service occupations;
during the transition period, eighteen; and at the time of the investigation,
sixteen. In the South seven were in business; during the period of transition,
three; and at the time of the investigation, five. In the South four were in
practice as professional men; during the period of transition only three;
while at the time of the investigation there were five, one just beginning to
practice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As to whether any previous occupational training was used or abandoned
after coming to the North, it appeared that of the 225 only 91 utilized such
training. In 134 cases previous training was not used, but these included
many who were farmers in the South.
</p>

<p>
Of forty-nine who had been engaged in personal-service occupations before
coming to Chicago, only twenty still continued in such work. Six were unemployed
at the time of the investigation, nineteen were in unskilled work, one
was doing skilled work, and three were in business.
</p>

<p>
Forty-nine women were heads of families as revealed by the 274 family
histories. This does not include all the Negro women shown by the histories
to be engaged in gainful occupations in Chicago. Often daughters were
working. There were thirty instances in which man and wife both worked
outside of the home. Before coming to Chicago 129 wives were employed,
while in Chicago sixty-seven wives were gainfully employed, including the
thirty who were working in addition to their husbands. During the period
of transition, it appears, they helped out, since the records show that 132
were then at work. But the tendency plainly is to abandon the practice as
soon as the family becomes settled in the new environment.
</p>

<p>
Of seventeen women who had worked as house servants in their former
homes, seven were found in factories, three in offices, two in stores, and five
in unskilled manual labor.
</p>

<p>
Some of the transitions in occupation are especially interesting. One
oil-field worker in the South had become a shoemaker. A farmer had become
a postal clerk. A former superintendent of a label factory attended high school
during the adjustment period and became an undertaker. One who was a
schoolboy in the South worked in a hotel on coming to Chicago but became a
grocer. A barber in Kansas City became first a painter in Chicago, then a
janitor. A bottler from Memphis, Tennessee, went to work in the Stock
Yards but became a canvasser. A farmer from Alabama worked first in the
Yards and later in woolen mills.
</p>

<p>
One man was a porter in a store in Mississippi. In Chicago he became a
chauffeur. A farmer from Louisiana on arriving worked as a butcher and then
secured employment in a tannery. A porter in a wholesale grocery in Memphis,
Tennessee, who worked first in Chicago as a lard maker in a packing-house,
later became a building laborer. A preacher from Tennessee worked at
Swift's packing-house until he could become established in a church.
</p>

<p>
A Mississippi plumber who served as a butter maker for a time after
reaching Chicago became a contractor within three years. A hotel porter
from Alabama came to Chicago in 1918 and went to work in a steel foundry
and later in a soap factory. A farmer who worked on shares in Georgia tried
work in the Stock Yards in Chicago, but changed to a paint shop. An Alabama
man who worked in a sawmill there found a job in a steel foundry in Chicago,
and later went to the Stock Yards. A man who worked in an ice plant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
in Texas became a railroad porter after coming to Chicago and then found a
job as a butcher at the Stock Yards.
</p>

<p>
A man who began life as a bootblack in Atlanta came to Chicago in 1893
and sold newspapers until he could enter business for himself. For many years
he has been a jeweler. In the South his wife was a musician by profession.
To aid her husband in his struggle she worked in a box factory for a time after
arriving in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Clergymen sometimes abandon their profession for more remunerative
employment. One of these came to Chicago from Boston in 1904. For a time
he worked as a fireman and later in a packing-house. One who served as a
waiter on first coming to Chicago became an insurance agent, and another,
who was a reporter on a Negro newspaper on arrival in Chicago, became the
manager of a manufacturing company.
</p>

<p>
Few migrants continued in Chicago the employment in which they worked
in the South.
</p>

<p>
The family histories show that the Stock Yards industry absorbed many
of the migrants, and a large number went to work in the steel mills and iron
foundries, as well as in lighter manufactures.
</p>

<p>
Many Negro women have become hairdressers and manicurists after a
course in a school of "beauty culture" which also teaches the use of cosmetics.
Considerable skill is often required in this work, and the earnings often supplement
very substantially the husband's income and may be sufficient to make
an individual self-sustaining in case of need. Hairdressing is most frequently
done in the homes.
</p>

<p>
An occasional teacher, cateress, or seamstress was found among the Negro
women. Some of them remained in personal-service occupations, but a decided
tendency was noticeable toward office and factory employment.
</p>

<p>
In summary it is scarcely necessary to remark that wages in the North
far exceed those in the South. The difference in some instances is so great
that many foolish expenditures are indulged in before the relatively higher
cost of living is appreciated, or other conditions are properly understood.
High wages, supplemented by income from other sources, often proved a
temptation to unnecessarily heavy expenditures for material comforts, such
as food and clothing. With relation to food it did not appear that Negroes
were deliberately taken advantage of in their buying, but that they frequently
bought articles without considering prices that had been refused by others
because they were deemed excessive.
</p>

<p>
Insurance of one kind or another was often carried in the families studied.
In spite of high living costs, a considerable number of families were found to
have bank accounts, Liberty bonds, War Savings stamps, and good interest-paying
investments.
</p>

<p>
The testimony of Negroes who at some time had lived in the South was
mainly that they were obliged to work harder for what they got North. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
also declared that they were unable to save as much as they hoped or expected,
because of high prices. But in the great majority of cases satisfaction was
expressed over the improvement in their economic situation. While their
movements in search of better housing in Chicago were extremely frequent,
they still felt that they were better housed than in their former homes, where
bathtubs, steam heat, and electric lighting were almost unknown. Being
accustomed to a certain measure of dilapidation in their home surroundings
in the South, the Negro is not necessarily dismayed by the extent of dilapidation in
Chicago's Negro housing, though usually it is not long before he begins to think
of more substantial dwellings in better surroundings than those he first obtains.
</p>

<p>
Also in Chicago he finds available and accessible to his home many churches,
some with large memberships and adequately housed; the best schools he
has ever known; fine hospitals and dispensaries at his command; some playgrounds,
bathing-beaches, parks, and similar facilities for his recreation and
that of his children; settlement houses; libraries; and many other civic and
recreational societies that make a strong appeal to his interest and promote
his ambition for physical and mental development. He finds many motion-picture
theaters and other amusements for his leisure hours.
</p>

<p>
Where the habit has not already been established, he is learning to make
liberal use of all these facilities through the guidance and direction of Negro
newspapers and organizations working especially for the improvement of the
Negro group. There are indications of improvement in moral standards,
health, and civic consciousness through these contacts and the use of these
up-building social agencies.
</p>

<p>
The opinions of migrants and their feeling toward the community were
solicited. It appeared that above all they prized the social and political
freedom of the North. Satisfaction was expressed over the escape from
"Jim Crow" treatment in the South. They valued the independence possible
in the North, and sometimes spoke of having come North "out of bondage."
They recalled frequently the "shameful treatment received by the Negroes
from the white people in the South," the "intimidation and discrimination,"
and they were surprised and sometimes amazed at the fact that they could go
and come at will in Chicago, that they could ride in the front of a street car
and sit in any seat. Satisfaction was also expressed over the fact that they
could get a job at good wages and did not have to buy groceries at plantation
stores where they felt they had been exploited.
</p>

<p>
Thus, while they may have to work harder and may find it difficult for a
long time to adjust themselves to the environment, few indicated any intention
of returning to the South. In some instances, where adjustments have not
been made, some discouragement was evidenced, and they sometimes expressed
the feeling that they were no better off in Chicago than in their former homes.
The prevailing sentiment, however, was in favor of remaining in spite of some
greater difficulties.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Often Negroes from the South said they missed the care-free social greetings
and relationships that prevail in the rural South. They thought that people
in the North were "colder," that they did not show sufficient hospitality.
</p>

<p>
Asked what conditions they would change if they could have their way,
the most frequently expressed desire was for more and better housing.
Improvement of social, moral, or political conditions followed. Some emphasized
the necessity of improving the management of the migrants from the
South, whose new-found freedom had led them to become offensive in their
conduct. Interviews with migrants, however, indicated that instruction was
being received without offense from many social agencies on how to act,
dress, and speak in such a manner as not to create unfavorable impressions.
</p>

<p>
There were some complaints of political exploitation and of being obliged
to live in proximity to gambling and vice that were encouraged by political
bosses in their neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
The inquiry showed that membership in clubs, lodges, and kindred organizations
was almost as universal as church affiliation. There were only a few
families in which no member had any association with a fraternity or club.
</p>

<h4>
V. A GROUP OF FAMILY HISTORIES
</h4>

<p>
The general statistical treatment of these 274 Negro families takes away
many of their human qualities. For this reason a selection has been made of
various types of Negro families in order that a rounded picture of the whole
unit may be given. The family stories that follow include typical migrant
Negroes from the Southâ€”common laborers, skilled laborers, salaried, business,
and professional men. They illustrate the commonplace experiences of
Negroes in adjusting themselves to the requirements of life in Chicago.
</p>

<h5>
AN IRON WORKER
</h5>

<p>
Mr. Jâ€”â€”, forty-nine years old, his wife, thirty-eight years, and their daughter
twenty-one years, were born in Henry County, Georgia. The husband never went
to school, but reads a little. The wife finished the seventh grade and the daughter
the fifth grade in the rural school near their home.
</p>

<p>
They worked on a farm for shares, the man earning one dollar and the women
from fifty to seventy-five cents a day for ten hours' work. Their home was a four-room
cottage with a garden, and rented for five dollars a month. They owned pigs,
poultry, and a cow, which with their household furniture, were worth about $800.
The food that they did not raise and their clothing had to be bought from the commissary
at any price the owner cared to charge.
</p>

<p>
They were members of the Missionary Baptist Church and the wife belonged to
the missionary society of the church and the Household of Ruth, a secret order. Their
sole recreation was attending church, except for the occasional hunting expeditions
made by the husband.
</p>

<p>
<i>Motives for coming to Chicago.</i>â€”Reading in the <i>Atlanta Journal</i>, a Negro newspaper,
of the wonderful industrial opportunities offered Negroes, the husband came
to Chicago in February, 1917. Finding conditions satisfactory, he had his wife sell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
the stock and household goods and join him here in April of the same year. He
secured work at the Stock Yards, working eight hours at $3 a day. Later, he was
employed by a casting company, working ten hours a day and earning $30 a week.
This is his present employment and is about forty minutes' ride from his home.
Both jobs were secured by his own efforts.
</p>

<p>
The family stayed in a rooming-house on East Thirtieth Street. This place
catered to such an undesirable element that the wife remained in her room with their
daughter all day. She thought the city too was cold, dirty, and noisy to live in.
Having nothing to do and not knowing anyone, she was so lonely that she cried daily
and begged her husband to put her in three rooms of their own or go back home.
Because of the high cost of living, they were compelled to wait some time before they
had saved enough to begin housekeeping.
</p>

<p>
<i>Housing experience.</i>â€”Their first home was on South Park Avenue. They bought
about $500 worth of furniture, on which they are still paying. The wife then worked
for a time at the Pullman Yards, cleaning cars at $1.50 a day for ten hours' work.
Their house leaked and was damp and cold, so the family moved to another house on
South Park Avenue, where they now live. The house is an old, three-story brick,
containing three flats. This family occupies the first flat, which has six rooms and
bath. Stoves are used for heating, and gas for light and cooking. The house is
warm, but dark and poorly ventilated. Lights are used in two of the rooms during
the day. The rooms open one into the other, and the interior, as well as the exterior,
needs cleaning. There are a living-room, dining-room, and three bedrooms. The
living-room is neatly and plainly furnished.
</p>

<p>
The daughter has married a man twenty-three years old, who migrated first to
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, then to Chicago. He works at the Stock Yards. They
occupy a room and use the other part of the house, paying half the rent and boarding
themselves. A nephew, who was a glazier in Georgia, but who has been unable to
secure work here, also boards with Mr. and Mrs. Jâ€”â€”, paying $8 a week. He is now
unemployed, but has been doing foundry work. Mrs. Jâ€”â€” occasionally does laundry
work at $4 a day.
</p>

<p>
<i>How they live.</i>â€”The cost of living includes rent $25; gas $5.40 a month; coal
$18 a year; insurance $9.60 a month; clothing $500 a year; transportation $3.12 a
month; church and club dues $3 a month; hairdresser $1.50 a month. Little is spent
for recreation and the care of the health. The family carries insurance to the amount
of $1,700, of which $1,200 is on the husband.
</p>

<p>
The meals are prepared by the wife, who also does the cleaning. Greens, potatoes,
and cabbage are the chief articles of diet. Milk, eggs, cereals, and meat are also
used. Meat is eaten about four times a week. Hot bread is made daily, and the
dinners are usually boiled.
</p>

<p>
<i>Relation to the community.</i>â€”The whole family belongs to the Salem Baptist Church
and attends twice a week. The wife is a member of the Pastor's Aid and the Willing
Workers Club, also the Elk's Lodge. The husband is a member of the Knights of
Pythias. He goes to the parks, bathing-beaches, and baseball games for amusement.
The family spends much of its time in church and helped to establish the "Come and
See" Baptist Mission at East Thirty-first Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. They
have gone to a show only once or twice since they came to the city. During the
summer they spend Sunday afternoons at the East Twenty-ninth Street Beach.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Heavier clothes were necessary because of the change of climate, and more fresh
meat is used because of the lack of garden space and the high cost of green vegetables.
</p>

<p>
The wife thinks that northern Negroes have better manners, but are not as friendly
as the colored people in the South. She says people do not visit each other, and one
is never invited to dine at a friend's house. She thinks they cannot afford it with
food so high. She thinks people were better in the South than they are here and
says they had to be good there for they had nothing else to do but go to church.
</p>

<p>
She feels a greater freedom here because of the right to vote, the better treatment
accorded by white people, the lack of "Jim Crow" laws. She likes the North because
of the protection afforded by the law and the better working conditions. "You don't
have an overseer always standing over you," she remarked.
</p>

<p>
Life here is harder, however, because one has to work all the time. "In the South
you could rest occasionally, but here, where food is so high and one must pay cash,
it is hard to come out even." The climate is colder, making it necessary to buy more
clothes and coal. Rent also is very much higher here. They had to sell their two
$50 Liberty bonds.
</p>

<p>
<i>Economic sufficiency.</i>â€”With all this, Mrs. Jâ€”â€” gets more pleasure from her income
because the necessities of life here were luxuries in Georgia, and though such things
are dear here there is money to pay for them. Houses are more modern, but not
good enough for the rent paid. They had to pay $2 more than the white family that
moved out when they moved in.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sentiments on the migration.</i>â€”Mrs. Jâ€”â€” says "some colored people have come up
here and forgotten to stay close to God," hence they have "gone to destruction." She
hopes that an equal chance in industry will be given to all; that more houses will be
provided for the people and rent will be charged for the worth of the house; and the
cost of living generally will be reduced. She does not expect to return to Georgia
and is advising friends to come to Chicago.
</p>

<h5>
A FACTORY HAND
</h5>

<p>
In his home town in Kentucky, Mr. Mâ€”â€” was a preacher with a small charge.
Now, at the age of forty-nine, in Chicago, he works in a factory and is paid $130 a
month. He has an adopted son, twenty-three years of age, who is an automobile
mechanic in business for himself, drawing an income of $300 a month.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mâ€”â€” might still be a preacher on small salary but for the intervention of his
wife. He came to Chicago about 1900. His wife came from Nashville, Tennessee,
in 1902, and they were married in 1904. Mrs. Mâ€”â€” felt that she was too independent
to "live off the people" and persuaded her husband to give up the ministry. He
got a job as foreman at a packing-house, where he earned $25 a week for a ten-hour
day. Next he worked for the Chicago Telephone Company, and finally secured the
position with a box-manufacturing company which he now holds.
</p>

<p>
<i>Family life.</i>â€”The Mâ€”â€”s have adopted three children, having had none of their
ownâ€”the adopted son already mentioned, an adopted daughter now twenty years of
age, and another foster son of thirteen. The latter is in a North Side school. The
girl is in a normal school in Alabama. Both Mr. and Mrs. Mâ€”â€” completed high
school. All speak good English.
</p>

<p>
Wife and husband have separate banking accounts. Living expenses for such a
large family are, of course, heavy. For example, the bills for food aggregate from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
$42 to $45 a week, and more than $200 a year is paid in insurance premiums. Frequently
a woman is hired to come in and help with the housework. Food in good
variety is used. Illness prevented adding to the bank accounts during the year of
1920. An operation performed on Mrs. Mâ€”â€” cost $650 and the illness of Mr. Mâ€”â€” and
the daughter consumed between $900 and $1,000.
</p>

<p>
<i>Housing experience.</i>â€”The Mâ€”â€”s' first home in Chicago was a cottage in the
"Black Belt." They wanted a large house and found one on South State Street.
The neighborhood, however, was displeasing to them, and they moved to the North
Side to be near a brother's children. The house was too small, and they moved again
to another North Side address. Again the neighborhood proved distasteful, so
they bought the three-story dwelling on the North Side where they now live. It is
in good sanitary condition and is supplied with gas. As lodgers they have the wife's
sister and brother, who are actually members of the family.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”They belong to the Baptist church. Affiliations of a
secular nature include the Masons, the Household of Ruth, the Court of Calanthe,
the Eastern Star, the Heroines of Jericho, the North Side Men's Progressive Club,
the Twentieth Century and Golden Leaf clubs, and the Young Matrons and Volunteer
Workers. Mrs. Mâ€”â€” is president of a settlement club and a member of the Urban
League. After coming to Chicago three years passed before she mingled much with
people. She had always done community work in her southern home and feels that
her reluctance here was due to the fact that she did not know what the northern people
were like. She found them friendly enough when at last she did associate with them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sentiments on community problems.</i>â€”They came to Chicago because they had
visited here and liked it well enough to come back and settle. Conditions are not all
that they would like. They would like to see Negroes allowed to live anywhere they
choose without hindrance, they would suppress moving pictures that reveal murder,
drinking, and similar acts that lead young people to commit crimes. They would also
like to see newspapers abandon their habit of printing articles that are derogatory to
the Negro, thus creating prejudice, and of printing items unfit for children. Also
they would like to see better homes for Negroes.
</p>

<p>
For the Negroes, they feel, life in the North is considerably easier than in the
South, since they can always get plenty of work and do not have to work so hard as
in the South. The mixed schools in the North are especially appreciated because no
discrimination can creep in. The general lack of segregation on street cars, in parks,
and in similar public places also pleases them. Still they see difficulties for southern
Negroes who come North to live and are easily led astray. Southern Negroes are
not accustomed to the new kinds of work and are inclined to slight it. This is, of
course, unsatisfactory to their employers and accounts in some measure for the frequency
with which they change jobs. This may also account for the fact that white
people are averse to paying migrants well.
</p>

<h5>
A RAILWAY MAIL CLERK
</h5>

<p>
Mr. Lâ€”â€” was graduated from the Carbondale (Ill.) high school and the Southern
Illinois State Normal School, while Mrs. Lâ€”â€” was graduated from Hyde Park High
School and the Chicago Normal School. The latter is a music teacher. Before coming
to Chicago, Mr. Lâ€”â€” was a school principal in Mounds, Illinois, and Mrs. Lâ€”â€”
also was a teacher. They are northern people, the husband having been born in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
East St. Louis and the wife in Chicago. They have a daughter, three years of age,
and have living with them a niece and nephew, six and five years old, as well as two
adult women relatives.
</p>

<p>
<i>Economic sufficiency.</i>â€”As a railway mail clerk, Mr. Lâ€”â€” earns $125 a month. He
owns a house and lot in Carbondale and carries insurance on his life and property.
They spend $37.50 a month for rent, about $10 for miscellaneous items, $15 a week for
food, $4 a month for gas, $1 for barber's services, and always $10 a month is added to
the family's bank account.
</p>

<p>
<i>Housing and neighborhood expenses.</i>â€”In April, 1919, a flat building south of Sixty-third
Street, previously occupied by white people, was opened to Negroes. The
Lâ€”â€” family were the first of the Negroes to move in. A few white families wished to
remain and lived in the same building with the Negroes. Mr. Lâ€”â€” says: "We objected,
as they were not the kind of people we wanted to live with. My sister-in-law acted
as agent of the building, and the condition of some of the flats was terrible. The
owner was arrogant when the Negroes first came in, but he soon found that we would
not be pleased with just anything. He told us he saw that we were particular and
wanted things nice, and, said he, 'Seeing that you are that way, I'll do the best I
can for you, as I believe you will take care of the flat.' The Negroes insisted on the
laundry being cleaned and it is now being used."
</p>

<p>
The Lâ€”â€” family has had three stoves since moving in. After thoroughly renovating
the building and making many of the repairs themselves, the sanitary conditions
are good, and the owner makes no further objection to maintaining the good order of
things.
</p>

<p>
The white people of the neighborhood objected to having the building occupied
by Negroes. White boys of the neighborhood stoned the building, and its tenants
were obliged to call upon the police for protection. This antagonism now seems to
have disappeared. The white and Negro children play together amicably.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”Mrs. Lâ€”â€” attends the First Presbyterian Church
regularly and Mr. Lâ€”â€” is a member and secretary of the board of trustees of the
A.M.E. Mission. He is a Mason and a member of the Woodlawn Community
Organization, which has the betterment of the neighborhood as its aim. He plays
tennis for recreation and goes to concerts and the movies for entertainment. The
children in the family have made use of public playgrounds and libraries. Bathing-beaches
have been sought occasionally, and contacts have been made with the
St. Lawrence Mission, a neighborhood institution.
</p>

<p>
<i>Opinions on race relations.</i>â€”Mr. Lâ€”â€” thinks that agitation is of no assistance to
the problem and draws attention to the fact that lack of agitation on the part of
newspapers averted a riot in connection with one recent racial disturbance. "Housing
is the greatest difficulty confronted by the migrant from the South." It is his
opinion, further, that the Negroes are not understood, that the white people fear them
until they become really acquainted with the Negroes. "Contact," he says, "is the
only thing that will help to make conditions better. It is just a question of understanding
each other."

<h5>
A MULATTO
</h5>

<p>
Mr. Aâ€”â€” was born in Chicago and his wife in Helena, Arkansas. He was educated
in the Chicago public schools, and his wife attended Fisk University, Nashville,
Tennessee, and afterward the Chicago Musical College.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Aâ€”â€” is light in complexion and is frequently mistaken for a white man.
Several years ago, without announcing his race, he obtained work in a label factory
and remained for some time until it was discovered that he was not a white man, and
therefore the only Negro in the establishment. The officials, being the first to learn
his racial identity, decided to keep him as long as no objection came from the other
white employees. In a few years he became superintendent of the factory, which
position he held for eight years. He was treated as an equal by members of the firm,
who visited him at his home and invited him to their club. He was also president of
the company's outing club.
</p>

<p>
A short time ago he decided to enter business for himself, and both he and his
wife took courses in an embalming school. He now has a business with stock and
fixtures valued at $10,000.
</p>

<p>
<i>Economic sufficiency.</i>â€”His business income affords a comfortable livelihood and
a surplus for investment. He has bought one house and built another. These
two are valued at $8,000 and yield $90 monthly. He also owns stock in the Pennsylvania
Railroad and a fire insurance company, has $300 invested in Liberty bonds
and owns a $1,000 automobile.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”Mr. and Mrs. Aâ€”â€” attend Congregational church
services every Sunday and get much pleasure from concerts, lectures, and shows in
the "Loop." Their principal recreation is motoring. Mr. Aâ€”â€” is president of an
association of business men and of a charity organization. He is a member of several
fraternal organizations, contributes to Provident Hospital, United Charities, and the
Urban League. His wife is an active committee member of a charity organization.
</p>

<p>
<i>Opinions on local race problems.</i>â€”Mr. Aâ€”â€” thinks there would be no housing problem
if prejudice were not so marked. He mentioned a subdivision east of Stony
Island Avenue where it is specifically stated that Negroes are not desired. Homes
there are being sold for prices within the reach of Negroes, and he feels that at least
500 Negroes would be glad to pay cash for such homes anywhere in Chicago if they
were given the opportunity. He feels that proper protection should be given Negroes
against bombers.
</p>

<h5>
A TRANSPLANTED HOUSEHOLD
</h5>

<p>
Mr. Bâ€”â€” is seventy-two years old and his wife sixty-four. They came to Chicago
during the migration. They had difficulty in finding work suited to their advanced
age and in accustoming themselves to the simplest changes in environment. Neither
of them can read or write.
</p>

<p>
<i>Home life in the South.</i>â€”In Alabama they owned an eight-acre farm and a four-room
house and raised hogs, chickens, and cows. They both had worked twelve
hours a day for years and by denying themselves even a comfortable home had
saved $2,000. They were members of a church, although they could not actively
participate in church or other affairs of their rural community. When the migration
fever struck them they sold their property, drew out their $2,000, and followed the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
<i>Home life in Chicago.</i>â€”They first secured rooms and began the search for work.
Mr. Bâ€”â€” finally secured a job in a livery stable at $18 a week, but the work was uncertain
and the wages insufficient. Mrs. Bâ€”â€” went to work cleaning taxicabs. Illness
and frequent lapses in work depleted their savings. They rented an eight-room house
and took in lodgers, hoping to insure a steady income. They have nine lodgers in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
these eight rooms, in addition to themselves. There is no furnace heat; the bathroom
is out of repair, the halls dark and dirty, and they are using their old furniture brought
from the South. Three of the women lodgers came from the same Alabama community.
The habits and customs of this household are unchanged. They go out seldom, and
all of the women smoke pipes and use snuff.
</p>

<p>
Of the original $2,000 which Mr. Bâ€”â€” brought with him, he has $250 left.
</p>

<p>
They make no use of civic and social agencies and do not go to church because
they think Chicago Negroes are unsociable. They prize the fact, however, that
work is plentiful for the lodgers, and they have no intention of returning South.
</p>

<h5>
A BARBER FROM MISSISSIPPI
</h5>

<p>
Mr. Dâ€”â€” was a migrant and a member of a party of over a hundred Negroes who
left Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in the autumn of 1916.
</p>

<p>
He was a barber at home and earned an average of $25 a week. Mrs. Dâ€”â€” was
a good housewife. They owned a house and lot valued at $1,000 and furniture valued
at $500. They have two children.
</p>

<p>
<i>Motive for coming to Chicago.</i>â€”Mr. Dâ€”â€” had always read the <i>Chicago Defender</i>,
and usually got in a supply of these papers to sell to his customers and to supply
topics for barber-shop discussion. His daughter, then a student at Straight College in
New Orleans, was to be graduated that year, and he went to New Orleans to spend a
week. While there he worked in a barber shop. He found that the migration was
being much discussed. One day a man came into the shop and said he was a representative
of a northern industry that was anxious to get Negroes to come North
and work for it. He argued that the North had freed the Negroes, but had left them
in the South where they had not received good treatment, so that at this late date the
North was trying to right an old wrong and was now offering to Negroes a chance
to work. On the other hand the Negroes were indebted to the North for their freedom.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Dâ€”â€” returned home he sold his barber shop and left for the North
with his wife and children.
</p>

<p>
<i>Life in Chicago.</i>â€”Opening a place of business in Chicago, he called it the Hattiesburg
Barber Shop. It is patronized largely by Hattiesburg people who came up in
his party. His earnings are larger here, but at first his wife was forced to work in
the Stock Yards at $10 a week to help meet the family budget. Occasionally now
she works as a hairdresser. They pay $46.50 a month for rent. Their clothing bill
amounts to $650 a year. Last year they spent $200 for medicine and an average of
$18 a week for food. Their insurance premiums total $6 a month.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”In the South the entire family was active in church
affairs. In Chicago they have continued their church connections, and Mr. Dâ€”â€”
is one of the officials at the Olivet Baptist Church. They go to church four times a
week.
</p>

<p>
<i>Adjustments to Chicago.</i>â€”They were quick to begin adjustment to their new surroundings,
profiting by the advice and instructions of their present pastor. At the
end of six months they felt themselves quite at home. They feel the need for
using more careful English and are more formal in their greetings and relations with
persons whom they meet. They enjoy the "freedom of speech and action" allowed
in Chicago, the privilege of voting, the freedom from segregation, and the absence of
Jim Crow laws. They think Chicago is fair to Negroes in so far as laws are concerned,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
but believe there should be better enforcement of the laws. They find life
easier here, although there is more work to be done. They feel a great satisfaction in
the more modern homes and other comforts and pleasures they are able to obtain.
Each month they add a small amount to their bank account. They suggest that
Negroes who have become adjusted to Chicago should take pains in a kindly spirit to
inform newcomers concerning the proper deportment. They believe that if advice is
offered in the right manner it will always be gladly received. They do not intend to
return South.
</p>

<h5>
A STOCK YARDS LABORER
</h5>

<p>
A son-in-law of the Bâ€”â€” family, also from Mississippi, is employed at the Stock
Yards. His impressions throw light on the adjustment of migrants and on their
views. He said:
</p>

<p>
"A friend met me when I first came to Chicago and took me to the Stock Yards
and got me a job. I went to the front of the street car the first time I entered one
here because my friend told me to; I would not sit beside a white person at first, but
I finally got courage to do so.
</p>

<p>
"At Swift's the whites were friendly. There I was in the dry-salt department at
22Â½ cents an hour. The foreman, a northerner, had been there thirty-five years.
He was fair to all. I worked with Americans, Poles, and Irish. But the work was
very hard, and I had to leave. I carried my lunch with me. Negroes and whites
there eat together when they wish. I am now working at Wilson's. The Irish and
Poles are a mean class. They try to get the Negroes to join the union. When the
Negroes went to work Friday after the riot, most of the Irish and Poles quit and
didn't come back to work until Monday. They came back jawing because the
Negroes didn't join the union. White members of the union got paid when their
houses had been burnedâ€”$50 if they had families and $25 if they were single.
Colored members of the union got nothing when their houses had been burned.
That's why I won't join. You pay money and get nothing. The whites worked
during the riot; we had to lose that time. I lost two weeks. It seemed strange to me.
It looked unfair. They are still mean and 'dig ditches' for us. They go to the
foreman and knock us, just trying to get us out of jobs. The foreman so far hasn't
paid any attention to it. I am working in the fresh-pork department, handling
boxes.
</p>

<p>
"The Negroes stick together and tend to their business. Some of the Americans
and Polish are very friendly. Everybody does his own work. We use the same
showers and locker-rooms. They don't want us to work because we are not in the
union. One asked me yesterday to join. The Poles said non-union men would not
get a raise, but we got it."
</p>

<p>
<i>Opinions on race relations.</i>â€”"When I first came I thought the city was wide openâ€”I
mean friendly and free. It seems that there is more discrimination and unfriendly
feeling than I thought. I notice it at work and in public places. Wages are not
increasing like the high cost of living. As soon as one gets a raise, the cost of living
goes up [May, 1920].
</p>

<p>
"The whites act just as disorderly on cars as the Negroes. Monday evening
two white laborers sitting beside a white woman cursed so much that I had to look
around. Nothing is ever said about such incidents.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Rent goes up whenever people think of it. We have to pay $8 more since
April. Things are getting worse for us and we need to think about it. Still it is
better here than in the South."
</p>

<h5>
AN OLD SETTLER
</h5>

<p>
Mr. Sâ€”â€” was born in Baltimore in 1851. At the time of the gold rush to California,
his father took his family and started out to seek his fortune. They had got
as far as Chicago when his father was robbed and the journey ended. Mr. Sâ€”â€” has
lived here since. He has seen many changes during his sixty-three years' residence in
Chicago. When he came here the city limits were Twelfth Street on the South and
Chicago Avenue on the North, and there were no street cars. The Negro population
was 175. His parents took him on Sunday to the Railway Chapel Sunday School,
started in 1857 in two passenger cars by a Presbyterian minister, Father Kent.
The first building occupied by this congregation was on the site where the Board of
Trade now stands, 141 West Jackson Boulevard. This was destroyed in the fire of
1871. The second church was at the corner of State and Thirteenth streets, where
the Fair warehouse now stands. The next site of the church was that of the Institutional
Church at Thirty-eighth and Dearborn streets.
</p>

<p>
<i>Early housing experience.</i>â€”Prejudice, Mr. Sâ€”â€” says, was unknown in the early
days. He has lived south of Thirty-first Street for thirty-five years. They were the
first Negro family to enter the block in which they now live. He built his home
there and has been living there twenty years.
</p>

<h5>
A BASEBALL "MAGNATE"
</h5>

<p>
Mr. Gâ€”â€” was born in La Grange, Texas, the son of a minister. As a boy he worked
on his father's farm, went to school, and progressed as far as the eighth grade. He
was a good baseball player. He played first in Forth Worth, Texas, then in New York
and Philadelphia, and finally came to Chicago in 1907. The highest amount he had
been able to earn was $9 a week. His first job in Chicago netted him about $1,000
a year. In 1910 he had acquired ownership of the team, and now, at the age of
forty, it nets him $15,000 a year. His team has traveled extensively, having covered
the principal cities in the United States at least twenty-five times.
</p>

<p>
<i>Home life.</i>â€”Mrs. Gâ€”â€” was born in Sherman, Texas. She completed the first-year
high school at her home. She is a modest woman and a good housekeeper.
They have two children, a son of nine and a daughter of three. Mr. Gâ€”â€” has moved
four times in Chicago, seeking desirable living quarters for his family. He owns a
three-story brick building containing nine rooms, the house in which he now lives.
In addition he owns $7,000 worth of Liberty bonds and values his baseball team and
other personal property at about $35,000.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”Both Mr. and Mrs. Gâ€”â€” were church members in the
South. This membership is continued in Chicago. Mrs. Gâ€”â€” belongs to an A.M.E.
church and is interested in and helps support Provident Hospital and Phyllis Wheatley
Home for Girls, while Mr. Gâ€”â€” is a member of several fraternal orders, City Federation
of Clubs, and the Appomattox Club. Their recreation is baseball and dancing,
and they find entertainment in attending theaters and orchestra concerts principally
in the "Loop." Mr. Gâ€”â€” is very much interested now in a playground which is
being established near his home and a tennis and croquet club for young people in the
same vicinity.

<h5>
AN OLD RESIDENT
</h5>

<p>
Before coming to Chicago in 1886 Mrs. Lâ€”â€” had lived in Washington and Detroit.
Mr. Lâ€”â€” was successively a railroad porter, a night watchman, and a janitor. There
are four children, three daughters and a son. Two of the daughters are married and
have families. One is a dressmaker, another a stenographer, and another an accomplished
musician. The son is a typist. Several years ago Mr. Lâ€”â€” purchased a lot
near Forty-seventh Street on Wells Street on which he built his home. In this
neighborhood the family was reared. Mr. Lâ€”â€” died several years ago.
</p>

<p>
<i>Riot experience.</i>â€”Although the Lâ€”â€” family has been living at Forty-seventh
and Wells streets for over thirty years, and relations between the family and the
white neighbors in the block were cordial, gangs of hoodlums from other districts
practically destroyed their property. The house was attacked, some of the furniture
was stolen, and some was destroyed. The heavy pieces of furniture were broken up
and burned in the street. The building was so badly damaged that they were forced
to move into a boarding-house for a time.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”The Lâ€”â€” family lived in a section of the city in which
there were few Negroes, but maintained an active relationship with organizations of
the Negro community. They are members of the A.M.E. Church and Sunday
school and of two fraternal organizations. Mrs. Lâ€”â€” is a member of the Linen Club
of the Provident Hospital and is actively interested in the Old Folks Home. Miss Lâ€”â€”,
one of the daughters, is well known in the community as a musician and composer.
</p>

<h5>
A PHYSICIAN
</h5>

<p>
Dr. Wâ€”â€” and family came to Chicago in 1910. He had lived in Mexico City
until the revolution made living there hazardous. He was in good circumstances,
maintaining a comfortable household with servants. Since he has been in Chicago
he has had considerable difficulty in finding a home in a neighborhood fit for rearing
his children. He finally purchased a home on Grand Boulevard which is valued at
more than $25,000. It is a three-story building with brown-stone front, ten rooms and
two baths, and many works of art installed by the artist, Holslag, who formerly owned
the house, and who himself painted some of the decorations. Dr. Wâ€”â€” has spent
several thousand dollars on the furnishings.
</p>

<p>
<i>Home life.</i>â€”Besides the doctor and his family there are two other relatives. The
physician's income is adequate to maintain this establishment and in addition two
high-class automobiles. Mrs. Wâ€”â€” is a social leader and does much entertaining.
She is a patron of community drama and attends grand opera and the leading theaters
in the "Loop." They were formerly Catholics but now attend the Bahai Assembly.
Dr. Wâ€”â€” is a member of two fraternal orders and two social clubs. Their recreation
is tennis, boating, motoring, and bathing. He is a director of the Chicago Health
Society. He is an examining physician and a member of the board of directors in a
life insurance company. Both are members of the Art Institute and are active in
supporting the settlements and hospitals of the community.
</p>

<p>
In addition to her social duties Mrs. Wâ€”â€” continues the study of music. She is
chaperon at the regular dances of a post of the American Legion held in the South
Side Community Center; a member of the Library Committee of the Y.W.C.A.,
and is interested in the entertainment of Negro students of the University of Chicago.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
</p>

<p>
They are living in a neighborhood in which several bombings of homes of Negroes
have occurred, but Mrs. Wâ€”â€” says that their relations with the white neighbors are
friendly.
</p>

<h5>
A NATIVE OF CHICAGO
</h5>

<p>
Mr. Câ€”â€” was born in Chicago in 1869. His grandmother was part Indian and his
grandfather of Scotch extraction. The grandfather was born in Cincinnati, and
was graduated from Oberlin College. His father's brother was a personal friend of
Owen Lovejoy and Wendell Phillips. In Leavenworth, Kansas, a monument had
been erected to him as the first Negro captain of a volunteer company. He fought
with General Buckner in New Orleans, was active as an abolitionist, and his wife
was one of the women sent to Kansas to establish schools among Negroes. She taught
school for thirty-six years and was one of the first women in the country who were
graduated as kindergarten teachers. His maternal grandfather bought a home in
Chicago in 1854 and lived where the Federal Building now stands. At the time of
Mr. Câ€”â€”'s birth his father lived on Plymouth Court, then called Diana Place. They
lived for thirty-one years on South La Salle Street, where they owned their home.
</p>

<p>
<i>Economic sufficiency.</i>â€”Mr. Câ€”â€” is a graduate of the Chicago College of Dental
Surgery and practiced his profession until ill health forced him into other fields. He
has been a clerk in the county treasurer's office, assistant bookkeeper in a white bank
in Memphis, which position he held for two years, and assistant electrician for a telephone
company. Now, at fifty-one, he is superintendent of the Western Exposition
Company's building. Twice he has lost his savings by bank failures. He lost $9,000
through the failure of the Day and Night Bank in Memphis, Tennessee. He owns a
house and lot, oil and mining stocks valued at $4,600, Liberty bonds, Thrift stamps,
and carries a small bank balance. His present home is a four-room flat in a building
on South State Street, which contains forty apartments and two stores. With him
lives the family of his younger brother, who has a twelve-year-old son. He is a
member of the Baptist church and two fraternal orders. His chief recreation is
swimming, and he finds his entertainment in the "Loop" theaters and the city
library.
</p>

<h5>
A MISSOURI FAMILY
</h5>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Tâ€”â€” came to Chicago in 1919, the wife arriving one month before
her husband. They had been living in St. Louis, Missouri, where Mr. Tâ€”â€” was
employed as a roller in an aluminum works. Prior to that time he had been a houseman,
and before that a teamster.
</p>

<p>
There are two children. One is fourteen years old and in the first-year high school,
and the other is seven and in the first-grade grammar school.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tâ€”â€” has always been a substantial aid to her husband, and, as she says, she
"doesn't always wait for him to bring something to her, but goes out herself and helps
to get it." Accordingly, when reports were being circulated that Chicago offered
good jobs and a comfortable living, she came up to investigate while her husband held
his job in St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
<i>Home life in Chicago.</i>â€”The family lives on State Street over a store. They have
moved four times since coming to Chicago in 1919, once to be nearer work, once to
get out of a neighborhood that suffered during the riot, and twice to find a more desirable
neighborhood for their family. They are not satisfied with their present home
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
and are planning to move again as soon as a more suitable place can be found. With
them live a sister-in-law and her child, who are regarded as members of the family.
The house is in poor sanitary condition. The toilet is in the yard and used by two
families. There is no bath. The sister-in-law is a music teacher but does not earn
much. She pays board when she can afford it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tâ€”â€” is forty-seven and his wife forty-six years old. He is employed at the
International Harvester Company and earns $35 a week for a nine-hour day. He
consumes an hour and a half each day going to work.
</p>

<p>
Although Mr. Tâ€”â€” lived on a farm and too far from school to attend, he taught
himself to read and write. Mrs. Tâ€”â€” went as far as the eighth grade in grammar
school.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”The entire family belongs to a Methodist church.
Mr. Tâ€”â€” is a member of the Knights of Pythias and Mrs. Tâ€”â€” is a member of the
Sisters of the Mysterious Ten. They have no active recreation. For amusement
they attend motion-picture shows in the neighborhood. The children regularly use
the playground near their home and the Twenty-sixth Street Beach.
</p>

<p>
<i>Adjustment to Chicago.</i>â€”Their most difficult adjustment has been in housing.
They think landlords should be forced to provide better homes for the people in view
of the high rents.
</p>

<h5>
AN EMBALMER
</h5>

<p>
Mr. Bâ€”â€” was born in Texas, lived for a number of years in Tuskegee, Alabama,
moved to Montgomery, and thence to Chicago in the summer of 1906. His first
position here was that of coachman for $30 a month, room, and board. His next
position was that of porter, working fifteen hours a day for $30 a week. He accumulated
a small amount of money, and, wishing to enter business for himself, and not
having sufficient funds to attend a specialized school, he secured a job with an
embalmer and worked for him four years. In 1913 he entered the undertaking business
for himself. He is now buying a two-story brick building on a five-year contract,
to serve as a place of business and a home. The business is young and was begun on
small capital. To establish himself he exhausted his little bank account and sold his
Liberty bonds. His equipment is still incomplete, and he rents funeral cars and other
equipment necessary for burials.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”Both Mr. and Mrs. Bâ€”â€” are members of several local
improvement clubs; they attend Friendship Baptist Church, and each belongs to
three fraternal orders.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sentiments on local conditions.</i>â€”Mrs. Bâ€”â€” thinks the town too large for much
friendliness. Mr. Bâ€”â€” believes that there should be a segregated vice district. His
principal objection to the present scattering of houses of prostitution is that his wife,
who is frequently obliged to return home late at night, is subjected to insults from men
in the neighborhood. He thinks there should be a law requiring that landlords clean
flats at least once a year.
</p>

<h5>
A YOUNG PHYSICIAN
</h5>

<p>
Dr. Câ€”â€” is a good example of the numbers of young Negro professional men in
Chicago. His office is on State Street near Thirty-fifth. He was born in Albany,
New York, and his wife in Keokuk, Iowa. They have lived in Chicago since 1915.
</p>

<p>
<i>Early experiences in profession.</i>â€”Through a civil-service examination Dr. Câ€”â€”
secured a place as junior physician at the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium. At
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
the same time he passed with high rating an examination for interneship at the Oak
Forest Infirmary. At the latter place he was promptly rejected because of his
color, and at the former he was asked to leave nine hours after he reported for
duty.
</p>

<p>
<i>Economic status.</i>â€”Dr. Câ€”â€” owns a house and lot in his former home, Albany, which
he values at $14,000 and other property and stock holdings valued at $13,000.
</p>

<p>
<i>Education.</i>â€”Dr. Câ€”â€” was graduated from the Brooklyn Grammar School, the
Boys' High School of Brooklyn, and Cornell University, where he obtained his A.B.
and M.D. degrees. Mrs. Câ€”â€” is a graduate nurse. He is at present an associate
surgeon and chief of the dispensary of a local hospital.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”He has already assumed a position of leadership in
the social activities of the community, is a trustee of the new Metropolitan Church,
a thirty-second degree Mason, a member of the Knights of Pythias, Chicago Medical
Society, American Medical Association, Urban League, and a director of the Community
Service, and also an instructor at the Chicago Hospital College.
</p>

<p>
<i>Opinions on race relations.</i>â€”He believes that the recent migration of Negroes has
been an advantage in teaching Chicago Negroes the value of property ownership and
co-operation. He thinks the scarcity of homes for Negroes can be relieved by allowing
Negroes "as much freedom as the American dollar." Definite suggestions for
improving conditions within the race he gives as follows:
</p>

<p>
1. Establishment of a permanent medium for understanding between the two
racesâ€”a permanent commission to act in the adjustment of difficulties of any kind.
This body should be composed of Negroes and whites.
</p>

<p>
2. Rigid enforcement of existing laws.
</p>

<p>
3. A systematic campaign under the direction of the commission among Negroes
to teach them personal hygiene.
</p>

<p>
4. Negroes should join labor unions and refuse to serve as strike breakers.
</p>

<p>
5. When Negroes do act as strike breakers, the doctor thinks, race friction is
created and labor is cheapened. Negroes can obtain a square deal from the unions
only when they have joined them in sufficient numbers to demand justice by becoming
an important factor in the unions. If they are not permitted in certain unions
they should form groups of their own for collective bargaining.
</p>

<h5>
A YOUNG LAWYER
</h5>

<p>
Numbers of young Negro lawyers are establishing themselves in Chicago, and
their influence already is being felt in the community. A good example of this group
is Mr. Jâ€”â€”, who, although only twenty-eight years old, has been actively practicing
law six years. He was born in Kentucky and has lived in Indiana, Kansas, Ohio,
New York, and Oklahoma.
</p>

<p>
<i>Education.</i>â€”He completed high school in Kansas, graduated from Oberlin
College, and then went to Columbia University, New York, and received the degrees
of Master of Arts and Bachelor of Laws. His wife completed the junior year in
college in New York, studied art in New York City, and is skilled in china painting.
</p>

<p>
<i>Home life.</i>â€”Mr. and Mrs. Jâ€”â€” have one child of four years. They live in one of
the 1,400 buildings owned by a real estate man of that district who "notoriously
neglects his property." The struggle to establish himself during the first few years
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
in Chicago was difficult. Now Mr. Jâ€”â€” has the confidence of a large number of
people, and a clientÃ¨le which provides a comfortable income.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”Mr. Jâ€”â€” is a trustee of the institutional A.M.E.
Church, chairman of the United Political League, member of the Y.M.C.A., Knights
of Pythias, a Greek-letter fraternity and the Urban League, and is a member of the
Executive Committee of the Friends of Negro Freedom.
</p>

<p>
<i>Civic consciousness.</i>â€”He thinks that if working Negroes and working white men
can be led to regard one another as workingmen interested in the same cause the
color question will be forgotten. He believes that prejudice is based on the economic
system. With respect to housing he thinks a Negro should, as an American citizen,
be free to purchase real estate wherever he is able to make a purchase; that as long as
artificial barriers are set up there can be no successful solution of the color question;
that a man's respect for the rights of others increases in proportion to his intelligence,
and that the press can be a great source of evil or good in educating the people.
He believes that there should be clubs and educational meetings to instruct some of
the less refined classes of Negroes in conduct.
</p>

<h5>
A MIGRANT PROFESSIONAL MAN
</h5>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Fâ€”â€” lived in Jackson, Mississippi, until 1917, the year of the
migration, when they moved to Chicago. He followed his clientÃ¨le and established
an office on State Street near Thirty-first Street. Mr. Fâ€”â€” received his commercial
and legal training at Jackson College and Walden University. Mrs. Fâ€”â€” is a graduate
of Rust College and the University of Chicago.
</p>

<p>
<i>Home life.</i>â€”The Fâ€”â€” home evidences their economic independence. It contains
ten rooms and bath and is kept in excellent condition. They own six houses in the
South, from which they receive an income. Mr. Fâ€”â€” is the president of an insurance
company incorporated in Illinois in 1918, which has a membership of 12,000. He
has also organized a mercantile company, grocery and market on State Street, incorporated
for $10,000, of which $7,000 has been paid.
</p>

<p>
They have two sons, nineteen and twelve years of age, and three adult nephews
living with them. One nephew is a painter at the Stock Yards, another is a laborer,
and the third a shipping-clerk.
</p>

<p>
<i>Community participation.</i>â€”They are members of the Baptist church and of the
People's Movement, while Mr. Fâ€”â€” is a member of the Appomattox Club, an organization
of leading Negro business and professional men. In addition to membership
in three fraternal organizations, they are interested in and contribute to the support
of the Urban League and United Charities.
</p>

<p>
<i>Opinions on race relations.</i>â€”Concerning housing, Mr. Fâ€”â€” feels that some corporation
should build medium-sized cottages for workingmen. He thinks that the changes
in labor conditions make it hard for Negroes to grasp immediately the northern
industrial methods. Patience will help toward adjustment, he thinks.
</p>

<p>
He thinks that colored women receive better protection in Chicago than in the
South. His experience in the courts leads him to believe that Negroes have a fairer
chance here than in the South. Agitation by the press in his opinion can have no
other effect than to make conditions worse.

<h3>
B. PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF NEGRO HOUSING
</h3>

<p>
The purpose of this section of the report is to describe by a selection of
types the physical condition of houses occupied as residences by Negroes.
This description includes the structure, age, repair, upkeep, and other factors
directly affecting the appearance, sanitation, and comfort of dwellings available
for Negro use.
</p>

<p>
In 1909 the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy included Negro
housing in a series of general housing studies. This study was confined to
the two largest areas of Negro residence, those on the South and West sides.
Both of these were studied generally, and in each a selected area, of four blocks
in one case and three blocks in the other, was studied intensively.
</p>

<p>
The South Side area included parts of the Second, Third, and Thirteenth
wards between Fifteenth and Fifty-fifth streets, with State Street as the main
thoroughfare. The four blocks bounded by Dearborn Street, Twenty-seventh
Street, Armour Avenue, and Thirty-second Street were intensively studied.
It was found that within these four blocks 94 per cent of the heads of families
were Negroes. The buildings were one- and two-story, with a considerable
amount of vacant space in the lots. Half the lots had less than 50 per cent
of their space covered. The houses were for the most part intended for single
families but had been converted into two-flat buildings. Rooms were poorly
lighted and ventilated, the sanitation bad, and the alley and grounds about
the houses covered with rubbish and refuse.
</p>

<p>
Comparisons with other districts studied showed the following: Of houses
in a Polish district, 71 per cent were in good repair; in a Bohemian district,
57 per cent; Stock Yards district, 54 per cent; Jewish and South Chicago
districts, 28 per cent; and in the Negro district, 26 per cent. A study made
three years later by the School of Civics covering the same area showed a
decrease of 16 per cent of buildings in good repair. Five buildings had been
closed by the Department of Health as no longer fit for habitation. There
were leaks in the roofs, sinks, and windows of five-sixths of the dwellings.
In describing a typical house in this area, the report said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There was no gutter and the roof leaked in two places, the sink drain in the
basement leaked, keeping it continually damp, the opening of the chimney let the
rain come down there, the windowpane in front rattled from lack of putty. The
conditions in these houses are typical; almost every tenant tells of rain coming in
through roof, chimney or windows, and cases of fallen plaster and windows without
putty were too common to be noted. One aspect of the situation that should not be
overlooked is the impossibility of putting these old houses in good condition. Leaks
may be repaired, plaster may be replaced, windows may be made tight, and these things
would certainly improve most of the houses, but when all were done it would not alter
the fact that these are old houses, poorly built, through which the wind can blow at will.
</p>

</a>
<p class="caption">TYPES OF NEGRO HOUSING</p>
</div>

<p>
Lack of repairs to the houses in the "Black Belt" is accounted for by the
fact that owners do not regard the buildings as worth repairing, and that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
tenants can always be found, even though it is necessary to reduce rents somewhat.
This reduction is indeed notable. The School of Civics found that
while in 1909 50 per cent of the houses examined on the South Side rented
for as much as $16 a month, in 1917 only 13 per cent could command as high
a rental as that; that in 1909 the prevailing rents were $15 and $16 as against
$10 and $12 in 1917.
</p>

<p>
On the West Side the area studied generally was that bounded by Lake
Street, Ashland, Austin, and Western avenues. Here the situation was little
better. One-third of the families visited in the three selected blocks bounded
by Fulton and Paulina streets, Carroll Avenue and Robey Street were Negroes.
The remaining two-thirds represented sixteen nationalities. It was reported
that the white residents could get advantages and improvements for their
houses that a Negro could not. While 35 per cent of the houses were reported
in good repair, 31 per cent were described as "absolutely dilapidated" and in
a worse state of repair than those in any other districts studied except the Jewish
district. The report said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Broken-down doors, unsteady flooring, and general dilapidation were met by the
investigators at every side. Windowpanes were out, doors hanging on single hinges
or entirely fallen off, and roofs rotting and leaking. Colored tenants reported that
they found it impossible to persuade their landlords either to make the necessary
repairs or to release them from their contracts; and that it was so hard to find better
places in which to live that they were forced either to make the repairs themselves,
which they could rarely afford to do, or to endure the conditions as best they might.
Several tenants ascribed cases of severe and prolonged illness to the unhealthful condition
of the houses in which they were living.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That there was a continuing demand even for the shacks and shanties of
the "Black Belt" is evidenced in a report made by the Urban League of Chicago
in 1917 that only one out of every thirteen Negro applicants for houses to rent
could be supplied. At the height of the demand applications for houses were
coming in at the rate of 460 to 600 a day, and only ninety-nine were available
for renting purposes. This was due, of course, to the growing stream of
Negroes arriving daily from the South.
</p>

<p>
Covering the same area on the South Side as that studied by the School
of Civics in 1917 a canvass was also made in 1917 by Caswell W. Crews, a
student at the University of Chicago. He found that tenants had remained in
these dwellings in some instances as long as twenty years after their unfitness
had become evident, because the rent was low and they could find nowhere
else to go. He mentioned the mass of migrants from the South who, because
of their ignorance of conditions in Chicago as to what was desirable and what
was to be had for a given sum, fell an easy prey to unscrupulous owners and
agents. Mr. Crew's description said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
With the exception of two or three the houses are frame, and paint with them is a
dim reminiscence. There is one rather modern seven-room flat building of stone
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
front, the flats renting at $22.50 a month and offering the best in the way of accommodations
to be found there. There is another makeshift flat building situated above
a saloon and pool hall, consisting of six six-room flats, renting at $12 per month, but
in a very poor condition of repair. Toilets and baths were found to be in no condition
for use and the plumbing in such a state as to constantly menace health. Practically
all of the houses have been so reconstructed as to serve as flats, accommodating two
and sometimes three families. As a rule there are four, five, and sometimes six rooms
in each flat, there being but five instances when there were more than six. It is often
the case that of these rooms not all can be used because of dampness, leaking roofs,
or defective toilets overhead.
</p>

<p>
The owners are in most instances scarcely better off than their tenants and can
ill afford to make repairs. One house in the rear of another on Federal Street near
Twenty-seventh had every door off its hinges, water covering the floor from a defective
sink, and windowpanes out. A cleaning of the house had been attempted, and the
cleaners had torn loose what paper yielded readily and proceeded to whitewash over
the adhering portion which constituted the majority of the paper. There were
four such rooms and for them the family paid $7 a month.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In 1920 a cursory examination by investigators from the Commission
showed that the only change in the situation was further deterioration in the
physical state of the dwellings.
</p>

<p>
The movement of the Negro population across State Street eastward into
the area once occupied by wealthy whites began as early as 1910. Wabash
Avenue was the first street into which they moved. Gradually they scattered
farther east toward Lake Michigan. Following the migration from the
South the Negro area east of State Street expanded to the lake and pushed
southward. The houses which they found in the new territory, although
from twenty to forty years old, were a vast improvement over those they had
left west of State Street. These houses do not permit of any general classification,
for some are very bad while others, though not new, are in a state of good
repair, largely according to the care taken by previous occupants. Along with
descriptions of Negro homes must be considered the tendency among those
Negroes who were able to move away from the congested areas of Negro
residence. Some of the best houses occupied by Negroes in 1920 were in
districts until recently wholly white.
</p>

<p>
A rough classification of Negro housing according to types, ranging from
the best, designated as "Type A," to the poorest, designated as "Type D,"
was made by the Commission on the basis of a block survey comprising 238
blocks, covering all the main areas of Negro residence, and data concerning
274 families, scattered through these 238 blocks, one or two to a block, whose
histories and housing experiences were intensively studied by the Commission's
investigators. Approximately 5 per cent of Chicago's Negro population live
in "Type A" houses, 10 per cent in "Type B," 40 per cent in "Type C," and
45 per cent in the poorest, "Type D."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
</p>

<h4>
I.  "TYPE A" HOUSES
</h4>

<p>
Type A houses, with those of the other types, were not concentrated
wholly in any one section but were found widely scattered; there were none,
however, in the areas which in 1910 held practically the whole Negro population.
Examples of Type A were found on South Park Avenue between
Thirty-third and Thirty-fifth streets, where some Negroes had lived for six
years; on Grand Boulevard between Thirty-fifth and Thirty-eighth streets,
where a few had lived for three years; on Champlain, Evans, Vincennes,
and Langley avenues, between Forty-third and Forty-seventh streets, where
some Negroes had lived four and five years; and on Wabash Avenue between
Fifty-first and Fifty-third streets. In Woodlawn there are a few of recent
occupancy, one of which was built by its Negro owner.
</p>

<p>
Most of the Type A dwellings are of substantial construction, principally
of brick and stone. Some are old family residences in formerly high-class
neighborhoods, built to withstand the test of years. Consequently, although
they have been subject to the usual deterioration, they still afford a fairly
high standard of comfort and convenience. Some are large and exceptionally
well equipped with luxurious fittings and adornments installed by former
owners. Most of these houses were built and owned by people of wealth who
abandoned them. Many of them have since passed through several stages
of occupancy. Somewhat less permanent in their physical aspects perhaps
are the Type A houses in Woodlawn. Many of the houses in this district are
of frame structure, and they are not as commodious as those in the formerly
fashionable white districts. But they provide a desirable measure of comfort,
with less waste space and superfluous rooms.
</p>

<p>
<i>Comforts and conveniences.</i>â€”Type A dwellings are fitted with all the
conveniences required by well-to-do whites. Some of them have more than
the customary one bathroom, have electricity and gas, and are well heated
by steam or hot-air furnaces. One example of Type A housing is a three-story,
stone-front, ten-room house on South Park Avenue owned and occupied by
a lawyer and his family. There is a garage, and the place is kept in good
condition. A twelve-room house, also on South Park Avenue, owned and
occupied by a physician and his family, has two bathrooms, steam heat, and
electricity, and is in excellent repair. Another physician on the same street
owns a three-story brown-stone house, with a garage. It contains ten rooms
and two bathrooms, has steam heat and electric lights, and is in good condition.
For this property he paid $35,000. A three-story brick house on Vernon
Avenue is owned and occupied by a business man. In addition to other modern
conveniences there are lavatories in four of the bedrooms. The house is in
excellent condition. A nine-room house on Langley Avenue, in good repair,
owned by another business man, has gas, furnace heat, and a bathroom.
</p>

<p>
<i>The occupants.</i>â€”Although these buildings are occupied by the wealthier
Negroes, business or professional men, it often happens that others secure and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
occupy such houses. High wages during the war and immediately afterward
permitted some Negroes who arrived in Chicago during the migration to live
in the best class of housing available for Negroes. For example, an undertaker
owns such a house on Langley Avenue, with seven rooms, with gas, a bathroom,
electricity, and hot-water heat. This building is ornate and in excellent
repair. A postal clerk who has been in Chicago since 1897 owns a seven-room
house on Champlain Avenue south of Sixty-sixth Street, where he lives with
his wife and child. In the block south of Forty-third Street on Prairie Avenue
is a nine-room house occupied by an employee of the American Express Company.
In order to help pay the rent, four lodgers are taken, who together
pay $20 a week. The house, which includes a bathroom, is furnace-heated
and lighted by electricity. A transfer man pays $65 a month rent for an
eight-room house of this class on Bowen Avenue. He earns $35 a week, and
two lodgers pay $50 a month. The house has bath, electricity, and furnace.
A railroad porter, who has been a doctor's assistant and has lived in Chicago
since 1886, owns a house on Rhodes Avenue near Sixty-sixth Street. It has
seven rooms and is provided with a furnace, gas, bathroom, and electricity.
</p>

<p>
<i>Neighborhood conditions.</i>â€”Surroundings of Type A houses are generally
far more pleasant than those in areas where the majority of Negroes live.
The streets and alleys are usually clean, except where Type A houses are
in neighborhoods surrounded by poorer houses. The premises are generally
well kept. This is especially true where the occupants are owners. When
space permits, there is a lawn or a garden that shows signs of pride and attention.
One block was noted, however, where the residents reported that the
street was watered twice a day until Negroes moved in, after which it received
no such attention.
</p>

<h4>
II. "TYPE B" HOUSES
</h4>

<p>
Type B designates a class of houses which have not the size, durability,
permanence, architectural embellishments, or general standard of comfort
and convenience of those classed as Type A. They are usually flat buildings,
whether originally intended for that purpose or not. Frequently dwellings
are rearranged by landlords, when Negroes are given occupancy, to accommodate
two or more families in place of the one for which they were built. Type B
houses have less floor space, the average number of rooms is fewer, and they
have, as a rule, fewer modern conveniences. Still, they are good houses and
much superior to the habitations in which Negroes are most often found.
</p>

<p>
Occupants of Type B houses are frequently found to be clerical workers,
postal clerks, railway mail clerks, small tradesmen, artisans, and better-paid
workers in steel mills and Stock Yards.
</p>

</a>
<p class="caption">AN ABANDONED RESIDENCE IN THE PRAIRIE AVENUE BLOCK
WITH A FACTORY IN THE REAR</p>
</div>

<p>
Most of the houses in the part of Woodlawn inhabited by Negroes are of
Type B. Another district in which this type of house is found extends from
Fortieth to Forty-seventh streets on Langley, Evans, Champlain, Vincennes,
and St. Lawrence avenues. Although in this area a few dwellings are of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
Type A, the greater part of them fall under Type B. About 5 per cent of the
dwellings occupied by Negroes on the West Sideâ€”for example, some of those
on Oakley and Washington boulevardsâ€”might also be classed as Type B.
Brick or stone dwellings predominate in the districts where this type is found.
For example, the block survey made by the Commission covered twelve blocks
in the Negro residence in Woodlawn on which there were 190 brick or stone
and 119 frame houses. Practically all the Type B dwellings are one- and
two-family houses, and the majority are two-family houses. The Commission's
study shows that these dwellings are not overcrowded and house
their families comfortably. Many of the occupants own their homes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Comforts and conveniences.</i>â€”Most of these houses have baths, electric
lights, steam, hot-water or hot-air heating, and gas for cooking. Only a few
are heated by stoves or lack electrical fixtures. They were found to be in
good repair, well kept and clean. Special pride is taken by home owners
of this class in keeping the property presentable and preventing rapid deterioration.
Family histories reveal that most of the Woodlawn residents are long-time
residents of Chicago.
</p>

<p>
<i>Neighborhood conditions.</i>â€”In the neighborhoods where Type B houses
were found, no uniform standard of cleanliness was evident in streets and alleys
or in adjoining properties. They were as frequently unkempt as tidy.
Although the premises of Type B houses were generally kept neat, surrounding
untidiness often detracted from their appearance. But a block containing
a majority of this type usually had an appearance of being better kept, whether
the surrounding property was occupied by whites or Negroes. In the Woodlawn
area the surroundings of the houses were well cared for, and sanitary
measures were commonly observed. In some blocks in the Langley Avenue
neighborhood carelessness and neglect were evident. Vacant lots were no
more littered with rubbish than in white areas of a similar grade.
</p>

<h4>
III. "TYPE C" HOUSES
</h4>

<p>
Type C houses are the most common in areas of Negro residence. In
this classification are included about 50 per cent of the houses on the South
Side east of State Street, most of those in the North Side area, about 60 per
cent of those in the West Side area, practically all those in the Ogden Park
area, and many dwellings in the little Lake Park district.
</p>

<p>
Heads of families occupying Type C houses were usually unskilled wage-earners,
or in personal service. Their incomes were such that they could rarely
afford more than $20 a month rent.
</p>

<p>
<i>Types of houses.</i>â€”Eleven blocks on the North Side were included in the
Commission's block survey. In these blocks 146 of the buildings were of
brick or stone, and 123 frame. Fifteen were single houses, four were double,
and 167 housed three or more families, the largest proportion of such buildings
in any district examined. There were also four rows of houses. They were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
in a fair state of repair. Four-room houses or flats predominated among the
fourteen families whose histories were taken. In one instance seven persons
were living in four rooms, in another nine persons were living in seven rooms,
in another eleven persons were living in seven rooms. The dwellings were
mainly one- and two-story buildings, with a few three- and six-flat buildings.
</p>

<p>
A large proportion of buildings housing three or more families was found
also in Ogden Park. In eleven blocks there were 109 such buildings. There
were also sixty-eight single and no double houses. The frame buildings
numbered 189, and brick or stone forty-eight. Most of the houses were one-
and two-story frame buildings. The majority were in good or fair repair,
though one block showed gross neglect of repairs to exteriors, and practically
all needed painting. Five-room dwellings predominated among the fifteen
families whose histories were recorded. Overcrowding was frequent. In
one instance eleven persons lived in five rooms; in another nine persons in
five rooms.
</p>

<p>
In the part of the South Side area east of State Street and between Twenty-second
and Thirty-first streets forty-two blocks were surveyed. Michigan,
Indiana, and Prairie avenues have excellent dwellings, practically all of which
are still occupied by whites. Until a few years ago these were fashionable
residential streets, and the buildings are large, well built, and often ornate.
Surrounding them, however, are hundreds of houses, old and difficult to keep
in repair. In these forty-two blocks there were 767 buildings of which 163
were frame and 604 brick. About 37 per cent of these are of Type C.
</p>

<p>
The surroundings of these buildings appear in brief comments on some of
these blocks, taken from investigator's notes, as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Property has been allowed to run down.
</p>

<p>
Five vacant houses; yards full of rubbish; lodgers transient; families do not move.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Two vacant lots; yards well kept.
</p>

<p>
Garbage piled up on vacant lot; Negroes moving in.
</p>

<p>
Roomers move often; one poolroom; empty church building.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

Between Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth streets east of State Street seventy-eight
blocks were surveyed. There were seventy-eight frame and 1,523 brick
and stone buildings, 620 single houses, 559 double, 254 accommodating three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
or more families, and nine apartment houses. Of this group 51 per cent were
of Type C. The property and general surroundings showed age and the
beginning of rapid deterioration everywhere; in some cases there had been
attempts to care for the premises and in some cases neglect was obvious.
The streets, except Michigan Avenue and South Park Boulevard, showed
much neglect, and the alleys generally were dirty. Many of these houses
were occupied by their Negro owners. Negroes were found to occupy about
40 per cent of these Type C houses.
</p>

<p>
<i>Conveniences.</i>â€”In these two parts of the South Side area conveniences
and ordinary sanitary facilities are often absent. Gas is the common form of
lighting, and often it is not used. Family-history data revealed that there
were about as many homes without as with bathrooms. In a large number of
buildings families were obliged to use common toilets located in halls or back
yards. The dwellings were out of repair in some respects in nearly every
instance. Defects of this kind were often in the plumbing. Leaky toilets
or water pipes were common complaints. Some toilets did not flush. Some
sinks were leaky, as were some of the roofs. In some houses windows or doors
were broken, loose, or sagging. Some houses were very dirty.
</p>

<p>
On the West Side a situation not essentially different was found among
the Type C dwellings. Possibly baths were a little more frequent. Occasionally
there was a furnace, though stove heat was most common. Gas was the
usual means of lighting. The situation as to toilets was about the same, and
the buildings, being chiefly old, were usually out of repair in some respect.
The number of brick and frame dwellings was about equal. There were more
double houses in proportion to the single ones, and none that had three or
more families. Five-room dwellings were most numerous, and there was
little indication of overcrowding.
</p>

<p>
<i>Neighborhood conditions.</i>â€”Only two blocks in the West Side area were
rated as merely "fair," four in the North Side area were dirty, while only one
in the Ogden Park area was not cleaned. In the North Side and Ogden Park
areas distinct efforts were observed to keep yards clean. Premises showed
signs of care and attention, though an occasional vacant lot showed use for
dumping. Alleys in all three districts gave evidence of neglect. Some were
badly littered with garbage and rubbish.
</p>

<h4>
IV. "TYPE D" HOUSES
</h4>

<p>
Type D housing is the least habitable of all. The houses were usually
dilapidated, and in many cases extremely so. Most of the buildings are
among the oldest in the city. They were occupied only by Negroes at the foot
of the economic scale, many families living from hand to mouth, frequently in
extreme poverty.
</p>

<p>
This class of houses predominates in those parts of the South Side area
from Twelfth to Twenty-second Street along State Street and Wabash Avenue,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
and from Twelfth to Thirty-ninth streets and Wentworth Avenue. Many
Negro dwellings in the North Side area and about 35 or 40 per cent of those in
the West Side area were of Type D. Even in the area of the South Side
between State Street and Lake Michigan many of the older frame and brick
buildings fall into this classification. It is safe to say that 43 per cent of the
housing for Negroes is of this type.
</p>

<p>
Most of these dwellings were frail, flimsy, tottering, unkempt, and some
of them literally falling apart. Little repairing is done from year to year.
Consequently their state grows progressively worse, and they are now even
less habitable than when the surveys quoted at the beginning of this section
were made. The surroundings in these localities were in a condition of extreme
neglect, with little apparent effort to observe the laws of sanitation. Streets,
alleys, and vacant lots contained garbage, rubbish, and litter of all kinds.
It is difficult to enforce health regulations.
</p>

<p>
Although there has been protest by Negroes against the necessity of living
in places so uncomfortable and unhealthful, improvement comes slowly.
Contentment with such insanitary conditions is usually due to ignorance of
better living. For the poorest buildings low rents are offered to encourage
continued occupancy and to forestall requests for repairs. Prompt vacating
of many of these houses usually follows when a family can secure better accommodations
in a better neighborhood.<a name='FA_23' id='FA_23' href='#FN_23' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a>
</p>

<h4>
V. NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS
</h4>

<p>
Among the more intelligent Negroes neighborhood organizations were
found similar to those of white people. Dissatisfaction with local conditions,
failure of authorities to sweep and sprinkle streets or to provide adequate
street lighting, corner signs, and similar equipment usually prompt these
efforts. Three or four such societies have been instituted by Negroes in
Chicago. One example is the Middlesex Improvement Club, organized
following the riots of 1919 in a neighborhood including three blocks on Dearborn
Street near Fiftieth. Among other things it seeks to promote a friendly
spirit among the people of both races in a neighborhood which was turbulent
during the riots. It has extended some financial aid to its members when
required. It is financed by Negro business men with some help from white
business men of the locality.
</p>

<p>
Woodlawn has a community organization which reflects the friendly
attitude between the races in that district. Both whites and Negroes are
members, with a common community interest. This organization goes
somewhat beyond the usual neighborhood improvement association in scope
and purpose. While it embodies the usual purposes, it also seeks to induce
full use by all the people of the district of all public and semi-public institutions
that contribute to good citizenship. One of the notices sent out by the association
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
urged attendance at night sessions of public schools. It briefly set forth
the advantages for both young and older people, suggesting that their usefulness
to the community might thus be enlarged, that they might be trained
for profitable employment, and incidentally that young people could be kept
off the streets and away from demoralizing places. Attention was drawn to
the fact that "business men of the city are seeking young people, both colored
and white, for positions as stenographers, clerks, and trades people."
The notice closed thus:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We are desirous that you use your influence to maintain a spirit of friendliness
and good will among all citizens, white and black, and especially among the school
children, paying especial attention to the conduct of pupils to and from school. We
earnestly seek your co-operation in these matters.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the neighborhood of Fifty-sixth Street and Wabash Avenue is another
of these neighborhood leagues; all the members are Negroes. Meetings
take place periodically at the houses of members, and special attention is
given to such matters as the condition of their premises, care of lawns, etc.
</p>

<h4>
VI. EFFORTS OF SOCIAL AGENCIES
</h4>

<p>
Social agencies likewise have given considerable attention to the instruction
and encouragement of Negroes in better living. While this effort has been
directed mainly to the newer arrivals from the South, it has also had an effect
on many who have lived in the city for some time but have not yet adjusted
themselves to city life and more rigid standards of sanitation and deportment.
</p>

<p>
One of these agencies is the Urban League. Among other activities it
issued placards to be kept in sight in Negro homes, graphically contrasting good
and bad habits of living. Pictures showed the front porch of a Negro family
as it should and should not be used, with the pointed question, "Which?"
underneath. Then followed a sort of pledge of conduct:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>I realize</i> that our soldiers have learned <i>new habits of self-respect and cleanliness</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>I desire</i> to help bring about a <i>new order of living</i> in this community.
</p>

<p>
<i>I will attend</i> to the neatness of my personal appearance on the street or when
sitting in front doorways.
</p>

<p>
<i>I will refrain</i> from wearing dust caps, bungalow aprons, house clothing, and
bedroom shoes out of doors.
</p>

<p>
<i>I will arrange my toilet</i> within doors and not on the front porch.
</p>

<p>
<i>I will insist</i> upon the use of rear entrances for coal dealers, hucksters, etc.
</p>

<p>
<i>I will refrain</i> from loud talking and objectionable deportment on street cars and
in public places.
</p>

<p>
<i>I will do my best</i> to prevent defacement of property either by children or adults.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The guidance and instruction given by the South Side Community Service,
pastors of churches and Negro newspapers have stimulated the Negro population
to efforts at improvement of their property. One newspaper, for example,
conducted a column containing hints on cleanliness, sanitation, and deportment.
It printed items concerning objectionable conditions at given addresses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
and warned offenders that they were being watched by the neighborhood
organization, which might take action against them if they did not improve
their conduct.
</p>

<p>
Another way in which Negroes have been led to understand that habits
of orderliness and cleanliness are expected of them in Chicago has been through
a "Clean-up Week" in the spring of each year, when concerted efforts are made
to collect and dispose of tin cans and other rubbish on vacant lots and yards.
A "Tin Can Contest" was conducted by the Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A.,
which offered prizes to the children collecting the greatest number of tin cans
beyond 300. The 1,000 youngsters who participated in the Second Ward
were divided into eight regiments. The eleven-year-old Negro girl who collected
the greatest number of tin cans had a total of 6,840 to her credit. Next in
order was Hyman Friedman, whose total was 5,347. More than 100,000 tin
cans in all were obtained.
</p>

<h4>
VII. EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDERS
</h4>

<p>
Individual householders, especially those owning their homes, were found
to be trying to keep their premises presentable often in the face of discouraging
odds. Throughout the family histories appear repeated protests by tenants at
the failure of landlords to maintain a decent state of repairs and improvements.
</p>

<p>
None of the houses occupied by Negroes are of as high a standard, generally
speaking, as those occupied by whites of a similar economic status.
</p>

<p>
Negroes rarely live in new houses. Virtually all live in neighborhoods
where the housing is old. Negro houses, even of the best class, were built
from twenty to forty years ago. Conditions in these old neighborhoods do
not make for high standards of sanitation and cleanliness, nor the best habits
of living generally; and Negroes labor under a handicap in striving to attain
such standards.
</p>

<p>
Less attention is paid by public authorities to the condition of streets
and alleys in such neighborhoods than in localities where the housing is of a
higher grade. The streets are not cleaned and sprinkled as often and the
alleys are more likely to be dirty, unpaved, and generally uncared for.
</p>

<p>
In most of the localities where Negroes live, buildings that have not
already reached a state of great dilapidation are deteriorating rapidly because
of the failure of owners to make repairs and improvements.
</p>

<p>
Escape from undesirable housing conditions is difficult for any Negroes,
and for the vast majority it is practically impossible, particularly during a
period of acute general housing shortage.

</div>

<h3>
C. NEGROES AND PROPERTY DEPRECIATION
</h3>

<p>
No single factor has complicated the relations of Negroes and whites in
Chicago more than the widespread feeling of white people that the presence
of Negroes in a neighborhood is a cause of serious depreciation of property
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
values. To the extent that people feel that their financial interests are affected,
antagonisms are accentuated.
</p>

<p>
When a Negro family moves into a block in which all other families are
white, the neighbors object. This objection may express itself in studied
aloofness, in taunts, warnings, slurs, threats, or even the bombing of their
homes.<a name='FA_24' id='FA_24' href='#FN_24' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a> White neighbors who can do so are likely to move away at the first
opportunity. Assessors and appraisers in determining the value of the property
take account of this general dislike of the presence or proximity of Negroes.
It matters little what type of citizens the Negro family may represent, what
their wealth or standing in the community is, or that their motive in moving
into a predominant white neighborhood is to secure better living conditionsâ€”their
appearance is a signal of depreciation. So it happens that when a Negro
family moves into a block, most of the white neighbors show resentment
toward both the Negro family and the owner or agent who rents or sells the
property. Whites owning homes in the neighborhood become much exercised
by fear of loss both of money and of neighborhood exclusiveness and desirability.
The Negro suffers under the realization that, for reasons which he
cannot control, he is considered undesirable and a menace to property values.
Wherever Negroes have moved in Chicago this odium has attached to their
presence. The belief that they destroy property values wherever they go is
now commonly taken as a valid explanation of any unfriendliness toward the
entire group. This feeling takes on the strength of a protective instinct
among the whites.
</p>

<p>
So wide and menacing, indeed, has this feeling grown that the Commission
deemed it necessary to make a thorough inquiry into its basis and to determine,
if possible, to what degree the presence of Negroes is a factor in the depreciation
of property values. Therefore it is essential to distinguish clearly between:
(1) general factors in depreciation; and (2) presence of Negroes as an influence
in these factors, and also as a direct factor.
</p>

<p>
What is meant by "depreciation"? Real estate men know it as "a loss
in market value." Market value is "the price which a buyer who wishes to
buy but is not forced to buy will pay to an owner who wishes to sell but is not
forced to sell." Depreciation is reflected, not only in market values, but also
in appraised or assessed valuations. Before purchasing property it is customary
to take into account the surrounding conditions that affect its value, as
well as its inherent value. Assessed valuations, fixed for taxing purposes by
authorized public officials, fluctuate to some extent in harmony with appraised
valuations. This analysis of the factors that tend to determine the value
of real estate for one purpose or another gives a fairly dependable rule for
finding whether it has risen or fallen in a given period. If property is thus
shown to have decreased in value, it is said to have depreciated.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The value of real estate is determined largely by the human factors involved.
This fact accounts for the striking differences in value of property, for example,
on Sixteenth Street, on State Street, in the "Loop," on Chicago Avenue, and
on Sheridan Road. Convenience, desirability, and other factors involving
individuals who make up the public enter into the determination of realty values.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to distinguish between land values and improved-property
values. Usually buildings are erected that harmonize in cost with the value
of the land on which they stand. But this harmonious relationship may not
continue; developments in the neighborhood may increase materially the
value of the land, while the value of the improvements decreases as time goes
on. The values of the land and of the improvements do not necessarily rise
and fall together, though improvements generally tend to add to the value
of the land. Much, however, depends on the use to which the land is put,
and even more on the use of adjacent land. That use may be such as seriously
to impair the value of all the land within a given area or some particular tract
in that area. Such impairment is a chief reason advanced for zoning, so that
property values in various given districts may not be impaired through inharmonious
uses, and that property values throughout a city may thus be stabilized.
</p>

<p>
It is also necessary to distinguish between "deterioration" and "depreciation."
They are not interchangeable. Deterioration of improvements on
land affects the value of the improvement, not necessarily the value of the land.
The property as a whole may be depreciated by deterioration of improvements,
but an increase in the land value might more than offset this loss. This would
be accounted for by a possible change in the use of the land. For example,
the buildings on the North Side in which Negroes now live are uniformly
old and bad, yet the Negroes cannot buy them. The properties are in process
of change from residence to industrial use, and the values placed upon them
for the latter use are far beyond the financial capacity of the Negro residents.
</p>

<h4>
I. GENERAL FACTORS IN DEPRECIATION OF RESIDENCE PROPERTY
</h4>

<p>
Apart from any racial influence there are many causes of depreciation in
property values, the responsibility for all of which has often been thoughtlessly
placed upon Negroes. Throughout the city may be observed blocks, streets,
and neighborhoods running a declining course in desirability for residence
purposes, losing value, changing in character and, in short, depreciating, but
in or near which no Negroes live. The following are important factors of
depreciation not due to race:
</p>

<p>
<i>Physical deterioration.</i>â€”The natural wear of time and the elements is a
constant factor. Few houses are built to withstand these inroads over a long
course of years, even though they have the utmost care. Neglect and lack
of repairs and improvements hasten this deterioration sometimes greatly.
Character of occupancy is often a factor. Some occupants are highly destructive,
particularly in rented houses. Their careless or inept use of a house
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
often adds vastly to the wear and tear and hastens deterioration. Overcrowding
has a like effect.
</p>

<p>
<i>Change in the character of a neighborhood.</i>â€”Depreciation in property
values in large cities is due in marked degree to factors not purely physical.
There is always a continuing yet varying fluctuation in the character of neighborhoods;
a restless shifting of population and conditions due to growth
which rarely has been orderly or scientific. The psychological factor of
residential property values is such that they may change very rapidly with
the advent into a homogeneous neighborhood of a few families of a different
nationality or social status. Between Twelfth and Thirty-first streets in
the South Side Negro residence area, once the most fashionable white residence
section, property values based on residential uses slumped utterly, and then
later began to increase because of industrial uses. Such a change is often due
to an encroachment upon a residential district of commercial or industrial
enterprises. Neighbors will move away rather than endure such disturbance
of their peace and comfort. Their places may be taken by people less sensitive
to such influences who may be drawn to the neighborhood by reduced
rents resulting from the exodus of former residents. Then rapid deterioration
usually sets in as the tone of the neighborhood falls. A like result follows a
change from an exclusive residential district into one of rooming-and boarding-houses
and large residences remodeled into flats.
</p>

<p>
The shifting of fashionable neighborhoods soon leads persons of means
to abandon a high-grade residential section for some suburb or newer neighborhood
which they think better suited to their social positions.
</p>

<p>
<i>Use of buildings for immoral purposes.</i>â€”Such use, though clandestine,
eventually becomes known; and although the property yields high rents,
it lowers the standing and value of the block or neighborhood and of adjacent
areas. It not only deteriorates the buildings thus used, but also drives decent
people from the locality; and the deserted houses either remain vacant or
are taken by less desirable occupants. Depreciation inevitably results.
</p>

<p>
<i>Public garages, theaters, and kindred nuisances.</i>â€”People of a high-grade
residential district do not wish to live too near a public garage, theater, bathing-beach,
saloon, cabaret, dance hall, bowling-alley, or billiard room. If they are
unable to keep such enterprises out of their neighborhood they will sell their
property and find homes elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<i>Changes in transportation facilities.</i>â€”These may depreciate property in
two ways: (<i>a</i>) they may themselves introduce obnoxious dirt or noise-making
features or bring in industries with such features; (<i>b</i>) new transportation
facilities often open up more desirable localities to which people are drawn
from the older localities. In both cases depreciation ensues.
</p>

<p>
<i>Overbuilding.</i>â€”Overbuilding is another and frequent cause of depreciation.
Building booms are often followed by years of depression due to an oversupply
of buildings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
</p>

<h4>
II. DEPRECIATION ON THE SOUTH SIDE
</h4>

<p>
The area from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth Streets and State Street to the
lake is now the center of the largest Negro residential area in the city, having
approximately 20 per cent more Negroes than whites.
</p>

<p>
In the eighties and nineties this area was part of the most fashionable
residential district in Chicago and included some of the city's most prominent
families and business leaders. They lived in houses which they had built
for their homes, and which were the first fine residences erected after the
Chicago fire of 1871. Michigan, Prairie, and South Park avenues and Grand
Boulevard were the most fashionable streets with the best houses.
</p>

<p>
The Negro population then lived immediately west, between Wentworth
Avenue and State Street and north of Thirty-fifth Street.
</p>

<p>
The North Side and the North Shore had not yet developed as fashionable
neighborhoods. Indeed, the most prominent residence on Lake Shore Drive
and one of the earliest stood almost alone for many years before fashionable
people settled around it.
</p>

<p>
As the North Side grew in fashionable favor the South Side began to lose
its original exclusiveness, and its residences began to depreciate. These
properties, while their original owners occupied them, were worth, many of
them, from $30,000 to $100,000, including large grounds, elaborate interior
decorations, and sometimes works of art. The usual range of the original
costs of these houses was from $10,000 to $30,000. The change steadily
continued, and these houses were rented and sold by the first owners at reduced
prices to persons less prominent socially, until nearly all the original families
had gone. A few refused to sell their houses and left them in charge of caretakers;
and a very few still remain.
</p>

<p>
The gradual lowering of the market value of the property is pictured by
prominent real estate men well acquainted with the neighborhood for many
years:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is a positive fact, an economic fact, that any time a poor class of people moves
into a neighborhood formerly occupied by people who had an earning capacity greater
than that of the people moving in, there is depreciation. That is true whether Italians
move in, or Poles, Negroes, Greeks, etc. If the people moving into the neighborhood
earn less and have less than the people formerly living in that neighborhood,
there is depreciation.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Between 1900 and 1910 a few Negroes moved into Wabash Avenue. The
houses were very old and built close together, with few single residences.
Negroes did not progress farther eastward in any large numbers because the
next street was Michigan Avenue, probably the most select of all the streets
in the area. With the pressure of increasing numbers and ascending economic
ability urging them out of the congested, uncomfortable, and unclean dwellings
west of State Street, Negroes could and would pay higher rents than the class
of white persons to which the oldest houses would next descend. In 1912,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
in the area east of State Street, practically all of the original residents had
gone, and few Negroes had come in. Real estate men estimate that generally
natural depreciation proceeds at the rate of 2 to 2Â½ per cent a year. When
Negroes first came into the area the buildings were at least twenty years old,
and many were much older, representing at the lowest figure a very substantial
depreciation.
</p>

<p>
There was another important factor in the depreciation of the area. In
1912 the old vice district west of State Street and immediately northwest of
this area was broken up. The inmates numbered approximately 2,000 and
were by no means confined strictly within the recognized limits. They moved
into the nearest good houses available where they could continue to ply their
trade clandestinely. They could afford to pay high rents, and numbers of real
estate owners profited greatly by dealing with them. As many of these
houses stood, they again yielded rents almost as high as when they were new.
Cabarets, saloons, and amusement places packed the side streets, and buffet
flats opened up in the residence blocks. Raids and prosecution, night visits
from men who did not live in the district, called attention to the changed
character of the neighborhood, and property values sank lower. Pressure from
prosecuting agencies, as well as the attraction of better houses in less conspicuous
neighborhoods, urged the vice element southward. This southward
trend is indicated in the maps, facing pages <a href="#i-473">342</a> and <a href="#i-475">346</a>, showing the environment
of the South Side Negro.
</p>

<p>
While property in this area could be bought cheaply it was also possible
to obtain proportionately high rents by placing Negroes or prostitutes in houses
not rented to either class before. Negroes were always charged higher rents
than were the whites who immediately preceded them.
</p>

<p>
The Juvenile Protective Association in 1913 made a study called <i>The
Colored People of Chicago</i> and published it in a small pamphlet. Concerning
the disposition of real estate men to profit in this way, the reports say:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
... the dealer offers to the owner of an apartment house which is no longer
renting advantageously to white tenants cash payment for a year's lease on the
property, thus guaranteeing the owner against loss, and then he fills the building with
colored tenants. It is said, however, that the agent does not put out the white
tenants unless he can get 10 per cent more from the colored people.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The fact that for like quarters Negroes pay much higher rents than any
other group in the city was discussed by the Chicago School of Civics and
Philanthropy in a special study of housing for Negroes in 1911-12. The
report says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The explanation for this condition of affairs among the colored people is comparatively
simple; the results are far-reaching. The strong prejudice among the
white people against having colored people living on white residence streets, colored
children attending schools with white children, or entering into other semi-social relation
with them, confines the opportunities for residence open to colored people of all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
positions in life to relatively small and well-defined areas. Consequently the demand
for houses and apartments within these areas is strong and comparatively steady,
and since the landlord is reasonably certain that the house or apartment can be
filled at any time, as long as it is in any way tenantable, he takes advantage of his
opportunities to raise rents and to postpone repairs.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It was during this period that buildings could be easily purchased by
Negroes. One white real estate dealer whose interests are almost exclusively
in the area under discussion has purchased more than 1,000 such houses which
he rents to Negroes. These buildings were not purchased from Negroes but
from first, second, and third owners, and at a price much below the original value.
</p>

<p>
With an opportunity for renting or purchasing the houses in this area,
Negroes began to move in, first in small numbers and soon in larger numbers.
They naturally sought to abandon the generally and often extremely dilapidated
houses west of State Street.
</p>

<h4>
III. DEPRECIATION AFTER THE COMING OF NEGROES
</h4>

<p>
Buildings twenty to thirty years old deteriorate rapidly unless expensive
repairs are made. As Negroes were often unable to make such repairs while
paying for the property, the depreciation continued.
</p>

<p>
Widespread buying of property in this district by Negroes began
during the period of the migration. Many home-owning Negroes, having
sold their property in the South and brought the money to Chicago, found it
easier to buy a house here on a first payment of $200 to $500, and on monthly
instalments thereafter, than to pay the rents demanded. Few, however,
knew anything of city property values; they were often exploited by agents
or assumed larger obligations than they could easily handle.
</p>

<p>
Many Negroes purchased fairly substantial dwellings on the long-time
instalment plan without providing for repairs and maintenance. Usually
the monthly payment to cover interest, taxes, and instalment on principal
was about all the Negro and his family could carry, even though his wife's
wages supplemented his. Thus nothing was left for upkeep.
</p>

<p>
Real estate agents before the Commission agreed that Negroes meet these
obligations with reasonable regularity. One white real-estate broker said:
"Those of us who have dealings with Negroes find that they make very fair
clients on the whole, pay their way, and ask no favors that any other human
being would not ask."
</p>

<p>
Another referred to Negroes as "wonderful instalment buyers" who have
a "tendency to invest in a home earlier than whites," and said that in fifteen
years' experience his firm had never foreclosed on a Negro home buyer; and
in only two cases, due to exceptional circumstances, had contracts been forfeited.
Two Negro real estate dealers said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A colored man usually feels that he will go without food rather than not meet his
obligations. That is one reason why sometimes his home is run down, because he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
has spent every dollar he can get to meet the payments on that property. He cannot
spare the money sometimes to buy a lawn mower or sprinkling hose.
</p>

<p class="p2">
A colored man who buys a piece of property in a neighborhood has no financial
connections. He meets his obligations promptly for three reasons: first, he wants
a home; second, he knows they may squeeze him; third, that mortgage is coming
due and he doesn't know where to go to get it renewed. We have no organization of
our own to back him. If the fence is to be fixed or the house is to be painted, and a
year from that date the mortgage is due, and he has $500 in the bank, he will not
paint his house for the simple reason that, if he did, when the mortgage is due he will
not be able to meet it. He saves, and when the mortgage comes due he has $500,
$600, or $700 set aside to meet it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Frequently Negroes overreach themselves in purchasing property. Charles
Duke, a Negro, in a pamphlet on Negro housing in Chicago remarked:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A very harmful result of present tendencies is manifested in the acquisition of homes
by colored people beyond their social or economic advancement. The economic
waste in this particular has been especially great. They represent in many cases
a considerable outlay of capital. The domestic facilities they afford are years beyond
the needs of the people to whom they are allotted. In many instances it costs a
small fortune annually to maintain one of these establishments, and when this is
not done the depreciation is both rapid and spectacular.
</p>
</div>

<p>
There is such lack of hotels and lodging-houses for Negroes, especially for
single men, that many Negroes have bought or rented houses with the intention
of paying for them, in part at least, with income from lodgers or boarders.
Such use leads to overcrowding, with consequent rapid deterioration and
depreciation. This tendency is accentuated by the fact that the houses
that Negroes can buy are usually old and deteriorated.
</p>

<p>
While new arrivals from the South soon learn that the poorest city tenement
requires better care than plantation cabins, their carelessness meanwhile
contributes to the property depreciation of their dwellings and neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
There are other factors of depreciation in this district which became active
after the Negroes came, but for which they were not wholly responsible. One
was the remodeling of residences for business purposes. While the remodeled
property may bring larger returns, neighboring residence property declines
in value. Many fine old dwellings on Michigan Avenue and Grand Boulevard
have been transformed in recent years into lamp-shade factories, second-hand
fur shops, and small business houses; and these changes have depreciated
neighboring property for residence purposes.
</p>

<p>
Another factor of depreciation is the city's tolerance of gambling and
immorality in and near areas of Negro residence. In most cities where Negroes
are numerous a like tendency appears. Little consideration is given to the
desire of Negroes to live in untainted districts, and they have not been able
to make effective protest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In 1916 the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>, in a series of articles on the Negroes,
described some of the disorderly saloons and cabarets in the South State and
Thirty-fifth streets region, with their vile associations of disreputable whites
and blacks:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Other resorts in the district are worse; some are better. These are typical of the
roistering saloons, a kind which would not be tolerated in any other part of the city
since the old Twenty-second Street levee was broken up. White proprietors have
brought them into the district, and many of them are patronized largely by crowds
from other parts of the city. The resorts are forced on the colored people. Those
colored families in good circumstances and desiring respectable surroundings move
away, only to find disorderly saloons trailing after them.
</p>

<p>
At 301 East Thirty-seventh Street, on the southeast corner of Forest Avenue, is the
saloon of Câ€”â€”. With this exception the district is a quiet, respectable residence
quarter. When it was known that this property was to be used for saloon purposes
a petition of protest was signed by 300 representative colored men and presented to
Mayor Harrison.
</p>

<p>
At night this saloon is an animated place. Reputable colored families object to
it chiefly on account of the numbers of disorderly white women who meet colored men
in its diminutive back room. In the barroom an automatic piano thumps through
the night until closing hours. On the mirrors are pasted chromos of "September
Morn" and other poses of nude women.
</p>

<p>
Buffet flats and disorderly hotels are adjuncts of the bad saloons. They make a
better harvest for the police than the saloons. The borderland of a colored residential
district is the haven for disorderly resorts. Protests of colored residents against the
painted women in their neighborhood, the midnight honking of automobiles, the
loud profanity and vulgarity are usually ignored by the police.
</p>

<p>
In one block between South State and South Dearborn streets which was canvassed
by the <i>Daily News</i>, five places were found openly admitted to be disorderly
houses. Some were in flat buildings, the other tenants of which apparently were
respectable, some raising families of children.
</p>

<p>
Many white owners of real estate who speak in horrified whispers of vice dangers
view such dangers with complacency when these are thrust among colored families.
Two years ago a woman of the underworld and her gambler husband decided to open
a "high-class" resort on the South Side. She got a location as a neighbor of reputable
colored people by purchasing the home of a former alderman and leader in a church,
the one of which the Rev. John P. Brushingham, secretary of Mayor Thompson's
Morals Commission, is the pastor. The woman was one of the most notorious of
the demimonde. An oil painting of her, as she was before her husband in a fit of
jealousy bit off a part of her nose, for years hung in a saloon of international reputation.
</p>

<p>
These are some of the influences which the colored population is forced to combat
in its fight for decency and good citizenship. A few secure political preferment and
others profit by catering to the city's vices, while the rank and file are hedged around
by demoralizing influences and the race is discredited unjustly.

Another chapter of this series dealt with gambling in the South Side
district. Here are two excerpts:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Colored men are in active control of the gambling situation in the big part of their
district in the second ward. Back of them are white police officials at one end of the
line and white politicians who keep them in power at the other end of the line. When
second ward, and even some adjacent ward, gambling is discussed by gamblers on
the inside, certain colored men are always mentioned. They are called "the syndicate,"
and their approval is said to be necessary if the police are to let anybody run
in the ward.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Whether gambling is a more dangerous cause of demoralization of a community
than are disorderly saloons, buffet flats and dissolute women is an often discussed
question. Gambling is a man's game, is more open, and the connection between it,
the police, and politics easier to trace. In order to gamble the police must be evaded,
which is difficult, or made blind by a peculiar remedy for itching palms or by orders
from political powers that be. However, it usually is the same police and the same
politicians who are protecting both classes of vice.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The contamination of these influences depreciates property and casts a
blight upon all who live within their unrestricted range. The taint extends
beyond the blocks in which they exist and serves to promote prejudice and
ill feeling against the Negroes who are the unwilling sufferers from these
vicious resorts.
</p>

<p>
There are many landlords who exact high rentals from Negroes for the
use of run-down houses. All investigations of Negro housing on the South
Side indicated that as a rule the rents are excessive, considering the inferior
dwellings, their disrepair, and unsanitary conditions. This neglect by the
landlords not only directly depreciates the property but encourages a careless
use of it by tenants that leads to the same end. One can hardly expect tenants
to respect property that is not respected by its owners.
</p>

<p>
Owners and agents of property occupied by Negroes differ in their opinions
of Negroes as tenants and in their ways of handling them. Of course there are
differences in character, standing, and responsibility among Negroes as among
whites, and this fact partly explains the following differences of opinion
expressed by experienced real estate men:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
One real estate firm, on Indiana Avenue, that makes leases to both white and
Negro clients, said that property occupied by Negroes was more likely to run down.
Another firm on East Fifty-first Street reported that it rented to Negroes on regular
leases and had no trouble about collections. A young Negro real estate agent on
Indiana Avenue said that he had no difficulty with collections: about half of his
tenants came to the office, and collectors called upon the other half. When a building
supports a janitor, he said, there is no trouble about repairs, but if the responsibility
is upon the tenants it is difficult to keep a building in repair. The office manager
for a firm on Cottage Grove Avenue said that the majority of its Negro tenants are
on leases; all pay the rent at the office; if they fall in arrears collectors are sent.
</p>

<p>
A firm which for many years has conducted a real estate business on the South
Side reported that 75 per cent of its Negro tenants are on a month-to-month basis
with thirty days' notice to terminate; and 95 per cent of them are north of Thirty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
ninth Street. A firm on Indiana Avenue requires its tenants to sign leases; and in
districts where there is much shifting about, or where the property is for sale, a sixty
days' notice clause is inserted. It usually sends a collector, so that proper supervision
may be kept of the property. Its head expressed the opinion that Negroes are
just as good tenants as whites whose wages are on about the same scale.
</p>

<p>
The office manager of an owner with about 1,400 Negro tenants said that on the
whole they compared very favorably with the white tenants who preceded them;
while some Negroes are careless and ignorant, they all paid their rent promptly; his
office did not average one eviction a month, and when Negroes are evicted they rarely
cause trouble. Quite the contrary was the report of the office manager of a real
estate firm on East Thirty-first Street, which does an extensive business with Negroes.
Much depreciation, he said, can be attributed to Negro tenants; they are much harder
on houses than white tenants of the same station in life; they do not take proper care
of the furnaces or plumbing, and the higher rents paid by them merely cover the cost
of the additional repairs; the recent comers pay their rent promptly when they have
brought money with them or when they receive good wages, but later on become difficult
to manage because they find it hard to adjust themselves to city life.
</p>

<p class="p2">
A firm on East Forty-seventh Street reported that it has a large number of Negro
tenants, makes leases to them, has no difficulty in collecting rents, and considers
them more desirable than the whites who preceded them; a firm on Indiana Avenue
expressed the opinion that depreciation is very great in houses rented to Negroes.
That Negro tenants pay their rent promptly was the experience of a real estate agent
on Cottage Grove Avenue. He has many Negro tenants on leases and is well satisfied
with them, although he does not think they take as good care of the property
as do the whites; Negroes are usually occupants of old buildings, which are more
difficult to take care of.
</p>

<p>
Another real estate dealer on Cottage Grove Avenue who leases to Negroes finds
that usually they adhere to the terms of the lease, although they sometimes move
without notice. A dealer on Wabash Avenue, who rents flats to Negroes, said
that he looked up the housing record of Negroes carefully before letting them in, yet
he sometimes had trouble with them. Once he rented a flat to a mother and daughter,
and the next day he found another family living in it; but on the whole he was well
satisfied to have Negroes as tenants.
</p>

<p>
A prominent official of the Grand Boulevard district of the Kenwood and Hyde
Park Property Owners' Association, which seeks to keep Negroes out of Hyde Park,
stated that a fundamental fault in connection with the strained relations between
whites and Negroes was the failure of white owners to keep their property in good
condition so that it might be occupied "efficiently," that is, by white persons.
Another official of that organization said that Negro tenants could not be expected
to repair white men's property; that there are a great many dwellings in the South
Side Negro district that ought to be condemned by the city health department,
and that Negroes are compelled to live in them because they can get nothing better.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In analyzing responsibility for depreciation, in the area from Thirty-first
to Thirty-ninth Street and from State Street to the lake, it is difficult to determine
to just what extent the Negroes are there because of prior depreciation,
and to what extent present depreciation is due to their presence. It is certain,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
however, that a large part of the depreciation is not justly chargeable to them,
and that their contribution is attributable partly to their economic status and
partly to the deep-seated prejudice against them. There are many instances in
which property occupied by them has appreciated in value. This will always be
true when the use by Negroes, or the demand for such use, is higher or greater
than any other use or demand. A symptom of the general prejudice is the
very prevalent belief that if Negroes have once occupied property its value is
thereby "destroyed" for white persons. This is true only until it has a value
for use by whites greater than its value for use by Negroes. So long and only
so long as Negroes as a class are, or are generally deemed to be, at the bottom
of the economic scale will their presence in a neighborhood depreciate values.
At present the fact stands out that Negro occupancy is an unmistakable
symptom of depreciationâ€”an indication that the value of property has fallen
to their economic level, as well as an aid to depreciation in its last stages.
</p>

<h4>
IV. DEPRECIATION IN HYDE PARK
</h4>

<p>
The area bounded by Thirty-ninth and Fifty-fifth streets and Michigan and
Cottage Grove avenues has several property owners' protective associations
for the purpose of preserving property values. Their dominant interest has
been the exclusion of Negroes because these associated property owners
believe that Negroes always depreciate the values of real estate. Negroes
have moved into the neighborhood and there has been depreciation. Therefore
Negroes are the cause.
</p>

<p>
A complete understanding of the situation requires that it be determined
to what extent property values decreased because Negroes moved in, and to
what extent Negroes moved in because property values had decreased. There
is no doubt that the thousands of protests against the "invasion" of Negroes
were sincere. It is also true that scarcely ten Negroes now living there could
have purchased their properties at the original prices.
</p>

<p>
A leading real estate dealer said that "when a Negro moves into a block
the value of the properties on both sides of the street is depreciated all the
way from $100,000 to $500,000, depending upon the value of the property in
the block"; that it was a fact and that there was no escaping it.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It's a condition that is inherent in the human race ... a man will not buy a
piece of property or put his money in or invest in it where he knows that he is liable
to be confronted the next day or the next year or even five years hence with the
problem of having colored people living alongside of his investment. This depreciation
runs all the way from 30 to 60 per cent. Some time ago a survey was made as a
result of which it was estimated that the influx of Negroes into white neighborhoods
during the last two years had depreciated property on the South Side about
$100,000,000.
</p>
</div>

<p>
He cited as evidences of this the increased difficulty of negotiating loans on
South Side realty on any terms, and the fact that some loan companies refused
to write them at all, and loan values there had dropped enormously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Grand Boulevard district of the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property
Owners' Association reported an even larger estimate of the depreciation
caused by the coming of Negroes into property near that boulevard. A
committee of the Association in a report made early in 1920 claimed that the
coming of Negro owners and tenants into that territory had depreciated
property values of $400,000,000 fully 50 per cent.
</p>

<p>
The advent of the first Negro families in a white district usually creates
something like a panic. The white residents, in a great many instances,
fearing contiguity with Negroes and property loss, hasten to offer their property
for sale and move elsewhere. Even a threat that Negroes intend to occupy
a certain block or neighborhood will cause an exodus of white people, and their
property is customarily sold at a sacrifice. When many properties are thus
thrown on the market low prices are the certain result.
</p>

<p>
When in recent years, Negroes moved into the Hyde Park district, animosity
was aroused, and numerous bombings of property occupied by Negroes
followed. One of the oldest South Side real estate dealers, quoted in the
<i>Daily News'</i> series of articles in the summer of 1919, expressed the tense
feeling of an association there that was seeking methods to drive out and keep
out the Negroes:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We want to be fair. We want to do what is right, but these people will have to
be more or less pacified. At a conference where their representatives were present I
told them we might as well be frank about it, "You people are not admitted to our
society," I said. Personally I have no prejudice against them. I have had experience
of many years dealing with them, and I'll say this for them: I have never had
to foreclose a mortgage on one of them. They have been clean in every way and
always prompt in their payments. But, you know, improvements are coming along
the lake shore, the Illinois Central, and all that; we can't have these people coming
over here. Not one cent has been appropriated by our organization for bombing
or anything like that.
</p>

<p>
They injure our investments. They hurt our values. I couldn't say how many
have moved in, but there's at least a hundred blocks that are tainted. We are not
making any threat, but we do say that something must be done. Of course, if they
come in as tenants, we can handle the situation fairly easily, but when they get a
deed, that's another matter.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This fear of Negro neighbors has been used by some real estate agents in
promoting speculative schemes. By sending a Negro to inquire about property,
they alarm the neighbors so that they will consider offers of purchase much
below the normal prices. When the excitement has abated values rise again,
and a profit is made.
</p>

<p>
In the actual depreciation of Hyde Park property there were several
factors, usually overlooked, that were in no wise attributable to the presence
of Negroes. Some of Chicago's finest residences were located on Michigan
Avenue and Grand Boulevard south of Thirty-ninth Street. This was an
extension of the early fashionable South Side district and had residences that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
cost $350,000. But as in the case of the earlier South Side the neighborhood
long since had lost some of its first settlers and had begun to decline. The
World's Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893, was near the Hyde
Park neighborhood. To accommodate the millions of visitors at the Exposition
hotels and apartment houses were built in that district far in excess of
the normal need. The apartment houses, moreover, affected the exclusiveness
of the residence streets. The buildings were speculations. Large sums were
expended in the hope of immediate exceptional profits. Property on Sixty-third
Street sold at the Exposition time for three times the price it could
command today. This is typical of the speculative values that then prevailed
there. After the Exposition the removal of the first residents to the North
Side and to suburbs steadily increased.
</p>

<p>
The abnormal years just preceding the Exposition had brought in thousands
of workmen, who were thrown out of work when the Exposition buildings were
finished. This and the panic of 1893 made building costs very low and caused
further construction of dwellings in that district. Mr. L. M. Smith, a prominent
South Side real estate man, described this change at a meeting of the
Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The condition that existed after the World's Fair, if you will remember, in the
material yards and the labor market was this: Every yard was loaded up, and the
carpenters and the mechanics that were stranded here after the World's Fair were
glad to take jobs as janitors at $25 a month, in order that they could have good warm
places for their families, and buildings that were put up three and four years after
the Fair, along in 1894, 1895, and 1896, could be built at about 30 per cent cheaper
than those that were put up during the World's Fair. The consequences were that
you could rent a flat cheaper in a brand-new modern building than you could in a
building that was put up during the World's Fair, and as the older buildings could not
be rented, the owners finally had to come down in their rent more and more; they
got in less and less desirable tenants until finally the whole territory became undesirable.
</p>
</div>

<p>
These first "undesirables" were not Negroes, for Negroes had not then
moved across State Street. And there were other causes for the vacancies
and removals that admitted Hyde Park's first undesirables beside the overbuilding.
One was the proximity of the Stock Yards. Since the South
Siders could not have the Stock Yards moved, many of them moved themselves.
The railroads along the lake front, with their cinders, smoke, and noise, were
also a factor. Another was the creeping in of industrial plants that located
in and near the district, frequently in the face of protests. A striking instance
of this is the large assembly plant of an automobile company at Thirty-ninth
Street and Michigan Avenue. During recent years the automobile industry
has practically taken control of Michigan Avenue, once the most beautiful
street of the South Side.
</p>

<p>
The coming of apartment houses and boarding-houses was another signal
of declining values. It was shown that for twenty-five years scarcely a new
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
residence had been built on Grand Boulevard, once noted for its handsome
residencesâ€”due principally to the extensive building of apartment houses
there.
</p>

<p>
Racial prejudice other than that against Negroes has operated in many
instances to depress property values. The presence of Jews, Germans, Irish,
Italians, and Swedes has at times been objectionable to neighborhoods of
Americans or of another race. A leader in the movement to remove Negroes
from the Grand Boulevard area gave evidence of this, saying: "I know the
Irish killed a certain boulevard. I know the Jews hurt another one, and I
know the gambling element hurt another one."
</p>

<p>
On the South Side the Negroes were preceded by Irish. The original
settlers in the area around Thirty-first and Dearborn streets were mainly
Irish laborers who worked in the lumber yards and mills, the Stock Yards,
and other South Side industries. When they moved westward among their
own people, thirty-five years ago, the Negroes took their places.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes social or sentimental values are involved in the depreciation
brought about when a new race or nationality breaks down the exclusiveness
of a residence district. After the Exposition, for example, when wealthy
residents of Michigan Avenue, and Grand and Drexel boulevards deserted their
houses for more fashionable locations, many of them were bought by Jews.
This operated to depreciate adjacent property in the opinion of those who disliked
Jews as neighbors.
</p>

<p>
How the changes take place was well described by an experienced real
estate man: The original families have divided up and moved away; sons
and daughters have married; the servant problem has become acute, making
it difficult to maintain large houses; thus apartment houses have become
popular; houses are older and deteriorated, apartments are new and modern.
In 1915 when the number of apartments for rent was in excess of the demand,
a tenant would spend $25 or $30 in order to move into an apartment across
the street merely because it happened to be fitted with glass door knobs; a
high-class residence at Forrestville Avenue and Forty-fifth Street was sold
twenty years ago for $12,000; yet he told the purchasers ten years ago that the
property would not sell for more than $4,000 to $6,000; and that was before
Negroes had moved into the neighborhood. Apartments in that vicinity
still command a price approaching their original cost of building, because the
demand for them is stronger than for houses.
</p>

<p>
This real estate man made the broad statement that the depreciation has
taken effect, in the majority of cases, before a Negro family has moved into a
neighborhood. There is depreciation, he thought, due to prejudice, when a
Negro family moves into a good neighborhood that has been exclusively white,
but that there are very few such instances for the reason that Negroes prefer
to live where they are welcome, where there is no antagonism. With regard
to the district between Thirty-ninth and Fifty-fifth streets, State Street and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
Cottage Grove Avenue, he stated that the entrance of the Negro had not
appreciably affected values.
</p>

<p>
Another real estate dealer, experienced in South Side property and in
selling to Negroes, expressed similar opinions. The greatest depreciation, he
felt, was in the expensive residences, and he doubted whether property as a
whole in the square mile centered at State and Thirty-fifth streets had been
depreciated much if at all.
</p>

<p>
There was agreement among the authorities consulted that in an exclusive
neighborhood of wealthy residents marked depreciation in large residences
has taken place, followed by the introduction of apartment buildings. One
of the men who had earnestly opposed Negro entrance into the Grand Boulevard
district recalled when valuations on Grand and Drexel boulevards were from
$400 to $600 a front foot; then they fell to $125 or $150 a foot; and then gradually
climbed back to $175 or $200 a foot on account of the introduction of
apartment buildings.
</p>

<p>
Such variations in value are the usual accompaniment of unguided growth
in a large city. This unguided development brought depreciation, which was
manifest before Negroes began to make their appearance in the area.
</p>

<p>
The spread of clandestine prostitution, discussed in connection with the
area north of Thirty-ninth Street, did not stop at Thirty-ninth Street. As the
environment maps indicate,<a name='FA_25' id='FA_25' href='#FN_25' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a> there was a noticeable increase from 1916 to
1918 in the number of houses or flats used by prostitutes in the area south of
Thirty-ninth Street. These changes occurred before the spread of the Negro
population reached the neighborhood. Two houses, for example, at 4404
and 4406 Grand Boulevard, bought by a Negro woman and bombed four times
after she moved in, had been occupied by prostitutes just prior to her purchase.
</p>

<p>
<i>The coming of Negroes.</i>â€”In 1916 hundreds of buildings in the Hyde Park
area stood vacant and had been so for some time. Owners and real estate
men were offering large concessions in the effort to get tenants. Values had
fallen greatly. A prominent real estate man closely in touch with the neighborhood
estimated that 25 per cent of the buildings there were vacant, and that
there was little prospect of renting or selling them. Coincident with this
oversupply in Hyde Park was an acute demand among Negroes for houses,
intensified by the sudden addition of about 50,000 migrants. Many of them
had sold their property in the South and brought the money with them. Hyde
Park landlords were willing to sell or rent to them rather than lose their property
entirely. Many Negroes, however, instead of renting, purchased the properties
because of the exceptional terms offered.
</p>

<p>
This continued for about two years, when a demand for houses again arose
among the white population. There was inactivity in building throughout the
war period. Chicago was sharing in the housing shortage which affected the
whole country, which was estimated in the early part of 1921 at 50,000 houses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
As the demand of whites for housing became acute, Hyde Park owners began
to feel that their property was at a disadvantage due to the presence of
Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Plans for beautifying the lake front and improving Hyde Park were
emphasized as a reason for holding on to property there. Alderman Schwartz,
in addressing a meeting of the Grand Boulevard district of the Kenwood and
Hyde Park Property Owners' Association, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The South Side, and Hyde Park and Kenwood in particular, in past years has been
the choice residential section of Chicago, the show place of Chicago. Grand Boulevard
is the most magnificent street in the world, the finest boulevard of our wonderful
boulevard system. I know that for many, many years, in this town, it was the
ambition of people living in other parts of the city to arrange matters so that they
could have their homes on the South Side in the place where you now live.
</p>

<p>
We have seen the rapid deterioration. In the council and in the committees we
have decided that we must do something. The law has some very definite limitations
written into our constitution and statutes. It cannot afford any relief. You yourselves
must resurrect the South Side.
</p>

<p>
As one instance of what we attempted to do in the way of assuring to the people
who reside here that the South Side can and will continue to be the great place we live
in, we passed the Lake Front Ordinance. You people probably never realized what
a wonderful thing that will be for the South Side. It will take in the lake front from
Twelfth Street south to Fifty-first; it will affect the very choicest residential district
in Chicago, the territory between Thirty-ninth Street and Forty-seventh Streetâ€”in
this portion of the ward where we now are, something like $125,000,000 will be
expended in reclaiming the lake front for you people, you men and women who must
stand together to save your homes, see that your homes are kept as fine places to
live in, that your neighbors are kept the most desirable neighbors in the city of Chicago,
so that you may enjoy the benefit of that wonderful improvement that is to come.
Think of that tremendous stretch, from Thirty-ninth to Forty-seventh, of bathing
facilities, the finest in the world. More than a year and a half ago an estimate was
made of the loss in property values in the Oakland district, north of Forty-third
Street, and that was estimated to be $100,000,000. Now it is not only the loss of
money that interests us. It means not only that somebody has lost a certain amount
of wealth, but it means that somebody has lost comfort in living; someone has lost
joy in his home; someone has lost the opportunity to give his children the environment
that he wanted to give.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A survey made by the Hyde Park Property Owners' Association in 1920
showed that there were then 3,300 property owners in the area bounded by
Thirty-ninth and Fifty-fifth streets, Michigan Avenue and Cottage Grove
Avenue, and that of this number 1,000 were Negroes. Then began the attempts
to move Negroes<a name='FA_26' id='FA_26' href='#FN_26' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a> back into "their own neighborhood."
</p>

<p>
Many of the Negroes who moved into this area had substantial resources
enabling them either to buy property outright or so to arrange for payments
through instalments and mortgages as to render themselves secure against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
efforts to remove them. But in so doing they further complicated the status
of the neighborhood. Few white persons recognize the marked differences
among Negroes, so that in purely commercial dealings they are not as careful
in selecting Negro tenants as they would be among whites. As a result some
Negroes who secured property there proved damaging to property values, just
as would persons of a similar type from any other race.
</p>

<p>
Many of the houses for sale or rent were not suited to the incomes of
ordinary wage-earners. White persons whose incomes were sufficient to pay
the rental for such large houses preferred a different sort of house or neighborhood;
and whites of smaller incomes could find more suitable houses elsewhere;
while Negroes, hard pressed for houses, rented them, and took lodgers to fill
them and help pay the rent.
</p>

<p>
The exclusive occupancy of a block by Negroes is usually followed by less
care of streets and alleys. This neglect is general between Twenty-second
and Thirty-ninth streets and is beginning to appear in the territory between
Thirty-ninth and Forty-third streets where recently blocks have been "turned
over" to Negroes. Community associations are being formed in some of
these areas to protest against this laxity, and stimulate neighborhood interest
in neat premises.
</p>

<p>
<i>Appreciation of property.</i>â€”When values fall extremely due to a selling
panic among white owners, it is often followed by a decided recovery as the
Negro demand grows. Such a new market among Negroes, however, seems never
to have been strong enough to send prices for residence purposes back to original
levels. But many instances have shown that prices rarely stay at the
low "panic" level and frequently rebound to a level much above that at which
panic sales were made. Mr. Gates, a prominent South Side real estate dealer,
said: "If a Negro family locates in a street where the population is all white,
values are cut in two, but this would not be likely to occur if a large number
of Negroes were ready and willing to buy adjacent property at established
prices. Supply and demand would rule in such a market." Other real
estate dealers expressed the opinion that "if the white owners were not over-anxious
to sell when the Negro 'invasion' begins, they might later on obtain
as much or more for their property than they could have obtained before the
advent of the Negroes."
</p>

<p>
In numerous cases Negroes created a market for property when there was
none. A prominent white business man long resident on the South Side told
of a row of houses on South Park Avenue and Grand Boulevard that were
vacant for years until sold or rented to Negroes: they could not be sold at
all until they took on a value because Negroes were ready to buy them.
</p>

<p>
A prominent Negro physician bought a piece of property in an exclusive
white Hyde Park neighborhood. He lived there seven years and then sold
the property at an advance, and, to his knowledge, there had been no depreciation
in adjacent property.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A white real estate dealer bought a house in Grand Boulevard between
Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth streets about five years ago. When Negro
residents came some of the white people sold at a sacrifice. But he remained
and four years later sold the property for $2,000 above its cost to him.
</p>

<p>
An interesting instance related to property on Langley Avenue into which
a Negro family moved in 1919. The value of contiguous property remained
the same as of property two and three blocks east where no Negroes lived.
Six months later, across the street from this Negro family, a white man,
aware of their occupancy, bought a house and paid $1,500 more than it had
formerly been offered for.
</p>

<p>
Thus, notwithstanding the prejudice against Negro neighbors that usually
obtains, a block or neighborhood into which Negroes move is not always and
necessarily depreciated, so many and active are the other factors contributing
to depreciation (or sometimes preventing); and so frequently has it occurred
that these factors of depreciation have operated extensively prior to the arrival
of Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The fluctuation of values in response to sentiment, both inherent and
stimulated, manifested itself in a practice of certain real estate dealers on the
South Side. Although it was stated and believed that values were irrevocably
destroyed when a Negro family occupied a building, these agents boosted values
by announcing that another building had been "saved" or "redeemed,"
<i>thoroughly renovated</i>, and restored to its "rightful occupants." The Kenwood
and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association stated that this plan had
succeeded in sixty-eight instances of buildings "reclaimed" by the Association.
</p>

<p>
<i>A Prairie Avenue block.</i>â€”To study the processes and factors of depreciation
the Commission selected an obviously depreciated block on the once fashionable
Prairie Avenue, between Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth streets, into which no
Negroes had yet moved.
</p>

<p>
In 1885-90 Prairie Avenue was one of Chicago's most fashionable and
exclusive residential streets. Imposing brown- and gray-stone residences,
with balconies of stone and ornamental iron, broad bay-windows, and large
well-kept lawns behind high iron fences, gave evidence of the wealth and social
position of their owners.
</p>

<p>
The gradual decline of Prairie Avenue, as North Side and North Shore
neighborhoods became more fashionable places of residence, and long before
the approach of Negroes was even thought of, was exemplified in this block.
<i>Chicago Blue Book</i>, a broadly inclusive social directory, published annually,
shows that in 1890 the families living at forty-nine of the sixty-one addresses
in the block were listed; in 1900 there were eighteen of the forty-nine left;
in 1910 there were only ten, and in 1915 only two. Second and third occupants
of the houses took the places of fifteen of the original forty-nine in 1900, of
nine in 1910, and of four in 1915. The <i>Blue Book</i> listings at five-year intervals
are shown in the table on the following page.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>

</a>
<p class="caption">A CHANGING NEIGHBORHOOD</p>
</div>

<p>
From 1895 on, those who moved away were to be found scattered all the
way from Lake Shore Drive to Lake Forest. The newcomers who took
their places appeared decreasingly in the <i>Blue Book</i> and more and more frequently
they had Irish or Jewish names.
</p>

<p>
A closer examination of the changing occupancy of the sixty-one houses
in the block shows strikingly the rapidity and extent of the decline and reveals
some of its causes.

<p>
<i>The residents.</i>â€”In a house with fifty feet frontage on Prairie Avenue lived
a wealthy artist, son of a Chicago pioneer merchant and member of several
exclusive clubs. He lived there until a large brick factory was erected at the
rear of his residence which is now occupied by a medical fraternity. A prominent
Chicago family lived in another house which they had built in 1885.
In 1890, they moved to Cleveland and rented the property. For sentimental
reasons they kept the property, although it was fast sinking in value. In 1919
a son living in Lake Forest proposed to remodel and improve the property,
if by reasonable expenditures he could be assured by real estate men of "desirable"
tenants. No real estate man felt able to do this, however, and the
deterioration and depreciation were uninterrupted.
</p>

<p>
Another residence, formerly occupied by a capitalist and journalist since
1890, was a large two-story house with basement and attic and two-story brick
barn. The family long since moved to the North Side, and the old mansion on
Prairie Avenue is now a rooming-house of thirty-eight rooms, including the
garage.
</p>

<p>
At another address lived the president of a large business corporation,
in a two-story stone-front building. It is now cut up into flats; and in the
window recently was a sign: "4th Flat for Rent, 6 Rooms, $20.00, <i>White Only</i>."
</p>

<p>
Only one or two of the fine old residences in this block are still occupied
by Chicago's "first families" or owned by their estates.
</p>

<p>
There are now two relatively modern three- and four-story brick apartment
buildings in the block, and five old residences are rooming-houses. One is a
club for railroad men, and another is a fraternity house. About a third of the
places are in fairly good repair.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The altered character of the block is revealed also in the number of persons
now at each address. The polling lists for March, 1920, disclose that fourteen
persons are registered from one address, ten from another, seven from another,
six each from three others, and so on, indicating more adults than are usually
found in a single family. These are probably roomers.
</p>

<p>
The problem, however, is a complex one, for, although no Negroes moved
into this block, they occupied parts of neighboring blocks during that period,
and their occupancy contributed to the final stage of depreciation.
</p>

<p>
The picture in neighboring Calumet Avenue is not essentially different;
perhaps the early occupants represented fewer of the "first families," and the
deterioration is more obvious.
</p>

<p>
The evidences of the oncoming of commerce and industry from the north
are numerous and inescapable. In this and adjoining blocks are now garages,
an auto-repairing shop, the South Side Dispensary of the Municipal Tuberculosis
Sanitarium, a factory for grinding bearings, and a carpentry and glazing
shop. An auto-laundry occupies the old church building.
</p>

<p>
This area is a comparatively short distance from the "Loop." In real
estate parlance it is known as "close-in" property. A former president of
the Chicago Real Estate Board stated that a large part of this "close-in"
property depreciated because of its change from residential to commercial
property. He mentioned Prairie and Calumet avenues, north of Thirty-first
Streetâ€”which includes the block studied. The depreciation, he asserted, was
also due to the "departure of many owners of costly homes to other districts."
</p>

<p>
With the city's growth, transportation became an increasingly influential
factor. The automobile made it easy to reach the business center from
outlying and suburban regions. It thus became less desirable to live near the
"Loop," particularly as such districts are susceptible to changes that may
quickly destroy an exclusive residence district.
</p>

<p>
The rapidly developing automobile industry gravitated very largely to
this part of the South Side. Its salesrooms, shops for the sale of accessories,
and kindred business places spread along Michigan Avenue from Twelfth to
Thirty-fifth street. Michigan Avenue is only two blocks west of Prairie
Avenue and one block west of Indiana Avenue. Garages, repair shops,
welding factories, and the like accompanied this invasion, and spread into
adjoining streets. For instance, on an Indiana Avenue corner a large eight-story
factory was built immediately adjoining the rear of a handsome Prairie
Avenue residence, and a one and one-half story garage and repair shop was
built in the rear of 2900 Prairie Avenue. Just northeast of the block are
factories and breweries with their noise, smoke, and heavy traffic; and from
the west and south Negroes have recently been approachingâ€”long after these
other factors were operating.
</p>

<p>
A peculiar fact about the property in this block and northward on Prairie
Avenue is that the lots are long and narrow, and the houses are built to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
side lines. These lots, when threatened with encroachment by factories and
the automobile industry, lost their residence value but did not easily take on
a new industrial value because they were individually owned and it required
several lots to make a suitable industrial site. The owners, though not desiring
to live there, were yet loath to sell as cheaply as the individual strip sales would
make necessary. And no investor would buy a single lot for industrial purposes
unless certain of getting two or three others adjoining.
</p>

<p>
In 1910 land values on Prairie Avenue between Twenty-sixth and Twenty-eighth
streets were $250 a front foot; and from Twenty-ninth to Thirtieth
streets, $200; on Indiana Avenue between Twenty-sixth and Twenty-eighth
streets, $200, and between Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth streets $175. In 1920,
however, values had dropped on Prairie Avenue to $60 a front foot while on
Indiana Avenue, a semi-business street, they were $150 and $180.<a name='FA_27' id='FA_27' href='#FN_27' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a> Negroes
first moved into the block on Prairie Avenue between Thirtieth and Thirty-first
streets about 1917, though very few lived there at the time of the inquiry
in 1920. In 1919 they purchased an abandoned church in this block which
at one time was valued at $125,000.
</p>

<p>
To summarize the results of this investigation of depreciation: Negro
occupancy depreciates the value of residence property in Chicago because of
the prejudice of white people against Negroes, and because white people will
not buy and Negroes are not financially able to buy, at fair market prices
property thrown upon the market when a neighborhood commences to
change from white to Negro occupancy; nevertheless a large part of the
depreciation of residence property often charged to Negro occupancy comes
from entirely different causes.
</p>

<h3>
D. FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF NEGRO HOUSING
</h3>

<h4>
I. NEGRO PROPERTY CONSIDERED A POOR RISK
</h4>

<p>
An important factor in the housing problem is the low security rating
given by real estate loan concerns to property tenanted by Negroes. Because
of this Negroes are charged more than white people for loans, find it more
difficult to secure them, and thus are greatly handicapped in efforts to buy or
improve property. The general opinion that condemns such property makes
the risk poor, even for Negroes. A Chicago Trust Company representative said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A Negro called to buy a mortgage. Our first thought was to submit to him one
of the colored loans, which we did. We showed him a photograph; he liked the
appearance of the building, and then he inquired, "Is this anywhere near the colored
district?" He declined the loan on that account, showing that this uneasiness is
not confined to the white investor.
</p>
</div>

<p>
When districts become exclusively Negro this reluctance to invest or to
lend invariably appears. If there are sufficient Negroes with money to create
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
a market the loss is somewhat relieved. Yet, deprived of the usual facilities
for purchasing a home, they cannot relieve their housing shortage and are
forced to seek houses in unfriendly neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
The factors are similar to those in depreciation, often based on prejudices
and erroneous beliefs concerning Negroes. Whatever depreciates real estate
necessarily depresses its security valueâ€”whether the cause be fact or opinion.
A South Side bank had difficulty in selling Negro loans to white people because
"they say they don't keep up the property; they let it deteriorate; they don't
improve it." The representative of another bank said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I don't believe you could find enough colored people who could make a substantial
first payment. There are a few that I have talked with recently who are on the
police force, who wanted to know how we could help them out in buying places. One
had in mind the purchase of a three-flat building; the price was around eight or nine
thousand dollars. There was a first mortgage on it of about five. He had only
$300 cash to buy it with.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A former president of the Chicago Real Estate Board said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The percentage of Negro people in Chicago who will buy homes is comparatively
small. The best evidence we have is that 85 per cent of the white people are tenants;
15 per cent of them are home owners. It follows, I think, that a smaller percentage of
the colored race will buy homes, not more than from 3 to 5 per cent of the colored
people at the present time.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A representative of a very large South Side realty business said: "There are
ever so many mortgage men not familiar with the colored belt. That's one
of their greatest reasons for refusing the loansâ€”they are not familiar with the
values."
</p>

<p>
Real estate men, white and Negro, were invited to present their views,
and leading mortgage-loan houses and banks of the city were asked what they
knew about Negroes as borrowers, investors, tenants, and clients, and their
thrift and care of property. Their testimony, with the Commission's investigations,
yielded a fairly accurate picture.
</p>

<h4>
II. NEGROES AS HOME OWNERS
</h4>

<p>
The first house in Chicago was a rude cabin built by a Negro in 1790.
There were several Negro home owners when the city was incorporated in
1837. The first Negroes to settle near Thirtieth Streetâ€”long before the city
had extended its limits that farâ€”owned their homes. Although prior to 1916
most Negroes did not own homes, there were many, especially business and
professional men, who had gradually acquired dwellings. The migration
brought thousands of Negroes with ready cash who found it easy to buy dwellings
on the South Side. The uncomfortable and inadequate dwellings of the
"Black Belt" could be avoided only by the purchase of property elsewhere.
Attention thus was directed, probably for the first time, to the question of home
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
buying by Negroes. Indeed home owning is an essential feature of any solution
of their housing difficulties.
</p>

<p>
Until the migration Chicago's Negroes had engaged chiefly in personal-service
occupations that governed somewhat the location of their homes;
when these were not in the "Black Belt" they were in shabby property in
undesirable streets near their employment. Men who worked on dining- and
sleeping-cars lived near the railroad stationsâ€”on State and Dearborn streets,
Plymouth Place, and the surrounding neighborhood; they were generally
renters and moved southward with the general trend.
</p>

<p>
<i>Home buying stimulated by high wages and the migration.</i>â€”The war brought
wages to the Negroes that seemed fabulous to many; and the wages brought
the migration. The first migrants were mostly drifters. Then came a great
many who had acquired considerable substance in the South, and having sold
out they came to Chicago with ready money, in some instances large amounts.
This class of Negroes bought dwellings. Several of them bought apartment
buildings, said a real estate dealer, and in one instance the buyer paid $10,000
in cash; and there were very many who were able and ready to pay from $1,000
to $3,000 on the purchase of a residence in a respectable neighborhood.
Another dealer said that he was not able to supply the buying demand:
"We have put renters on the side list; buyers are taking up the time. We
used to think $500 a good-sized payment for them, but now they often have
$3,000, $4,000, or $6,000. A Negro customer lately wanted a twelve-flat building
and would pay cash."
</p>

<p>
"The average newcomer is a home-owner," said another realty dealer;
"he has sold his home in the South to come here. Some say the high wages
are not attracting them so much as better schools."
</p>

<p>
Another dealer said that the average amount per family brought from the
South was from $300 to $500, and he knew of one family that brought $6,000.
</p>

<p>
It was the experience of another firm that three or four years ago Negro
purchasers paid down about $500, but that now (1920) they frequently make
first payments of $1,000 or more.
</p>

<p>
This sudden wave of home buying impressed Carl Sandburg, who wrote
(1919) in the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Twenty years ago fewer than fifty families of the colored race were home owners
in Chicago. Today they number thousands, their purchases ranging from $200 to
$20,000, from tar paper shacks in the still district to brownstone and greystone establishments
with wealthy or well-to-do white neighbors. In most cases, where a colored
man has investments of more than ordinary size, it is in large part in real estate.
Realty investment and management seems to be an important field of operation
among those colored people who acquire substance.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Several other factors contributed to this house-buying movement. One
was that Hyde Park had many available houses in the early years of the war,
while the Negro was excluded from the market west of Wentworth Avenue,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
with its smaller and less expensive houses, by the vigorous antagonism of the
Irish and other people living there. The southern Negroes were glad to find
thatâ€”at first, anywayâ€”access was not denied them to districts having good
schools, churches, recreation and amusements, and convenient transportation
facilities. This feeling was reflected in their purchase of churches; two of
these, one on Washington Boulevard and one on Prairie Avenue, are in districts
of extensive home buying by Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The high war wages contributed to home buying. Though in many
instances they induced extravagant expenditures, a surplus remained for many,
and with the frugal the savings were large.
</p>

<p>
High rents were another primary contribution. Many of the ambitious
newcomers figured that they could buy a house for about the same monthly
amounts required for rent. In many instances they thriftily contrived to
make the property pay for itself. Two- and three-flat buildings would furnish
a family with a home while providing a considerable revenue from the rented
flats. When old-fashioned houses too large for one family were bought,
lodgers and boarders were often taken. Frequently wife and children added to
the family income so that they might own a home.
</p>

<p>
A real estate dealer in Hyde Park said: "The Negro has purchased
90 per cent of the property where he lives, and 75 per cent of these are 'high-class
colored men.'" This estimate is too high, but it shows the impression
made by the large number of Negro home buyers.
</p>

<p>
An inquiry in two blocks on Prairie and Forest avenues disclosed that
40 per cent of the Negroes living on Prairie Avenue were property owners,
in the intervening block on Thirty-seventh Street over 90 per cent were owners,
while on Forest Avenue the Negro property owners were few.
</p>

<p>
In 1920 the School of Civics canvassed a small area occupied by Negroes in
the district west of State Street, a district where, because of their low economic
status, they would not be expected to buy. Of 331 families, thirty, or 10 per
cent, were owners, and all but one had been owners for from four to twenty
years, so that they had not been influenced by the migration.
</p>

<p>
Of the impression made by the home-buying migrants a very intelligent
Negro real estate dealer said, referring to the Chicago Negroes:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I will dare say that 90 per cent or even a greater number did not own their property.
They rented. It seems there has been a different spirit instilled into the
northern colored man. We bow to the southern man because he is a home owner.
The northern man was satisfied to rent. I was born in Chicago and felt the same as
others do.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The present trend was indicated in these statements of two well-informed
white real estate dealers on the South Side: "The colored people are demanding
homes and the tendency is to buy"; and that Negroes were continuing to
buy homes in the district between Thirty-ninth and Forty-seventh streets,
Cottage Grove Avenue and State Street, more sales being made to Negroes in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
that particular location than in any other. And this has been during a period
of acute and general housing famine in every large city.
</p>

<p>
<i>Methods of purchase.</i>â€”When Negroes first began to buy dwellings during
the migration years, the average price was $4,000 to $5,000, and the
initial payment, usually $500, ranged from $300 to $1,000. The time for
payment was ordinarily three years, though some contracts were for five
years. Later on Negroes began to buy houses or apartment buildings running
as high as $8,000 or $10,000, and the payments were increased proportionately.
</p>

<p>
That the Negro assumed a heavy load, sometimes more than he could
reasonably be expected to carry, was the opinion of several careful observers.
While the surplus from his wages might be expected to cover the monthly
payments, money for taxes, repairs, and insurance would have to come from
the wages of wife or children, or from lodgers.
</p>

<p>
In April, 1920, when work at high wages was abundant, a well-informed
Negro real estate dealer said that any Negro family head could then assume
payments of from $40 to $55 a month on purchased property. But many
Negroes made contracts calling for monthly payments of $65 to $75.
</p>

<p>
The opinions of experienced persons in close touch with the situation were
divided as to whether, in making such purchases, Negroes had assumed too
heavy obligations. One said his long experience showed that Negroes carry
out what they undertake to do; that very few default on their payments, and
when Negroes buy on the instalment plan "they pay out better than the whites
do, as a rule."
</p>

<p>
Another said, though Negroes buy only old propertiesâ€”and generally
pay more than white peopleâ€”they are careful in assuming their obligations
and make their payments promptly. They pay down to the mortgage, in
from three to five years, and sometimes within two years.
</p>

<p>
Another, who has been dealing with Negroes since 1907, gave his opinion
that they undertake their obligations seriously, and as instalment buyers of
property they are entirely satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
Still another South Side man who sells real estate to Negroes declared that
he had been getting better payments recently than he did three or four years
ago; in 1914, 1915, and 1916 he suffered considerable loss because of defaults
in payments on purchases or in rents.
</p>

<p>
A former president of the Chicago Real Estate Board remarked that
Negroes buy but do not build their houses, and are not yet sufficiently numerous
to create a market for real estate; that white people will not buy back
property once occupied by Negroes; that, as the numbers of Negroes increase,
this situation might be changed, but that the Negro who tries to sell old property,
on which he has put no improvements, will rarely find a buyer, because
there is so much old property available.
</p>

<p>
Certain banks and loan firms thought there would be a general foreclosure
of mortgages on recently purchased property as they fell due, that the Negroes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
are carrying such heavy payments on their contracts that they cannot reduce
their mortgages and consequently renewals will be denied; that the Negro has
not yet acquired sufficient stability to carry on payments over a long term of
years, and if wage reductions become general they will fall most heavily on
unskilled workers and render difficult the meeting of payments by such Negroes,
who constitute the great majority.
</p>

<p>
Most of the firms that had dealings with Negroes, whether as buyers,
borrowers, or renters, expressed satisfaction with their transactions with them.
Typical of their comments was that of John A. Schmidt, who found Negroes
to be prompter than Jews in making payments, and of Milton Yondorf, who
said that Negroes, like the Italians, finish paying for one house before undertaking
to buy another, and are eager to make the final payment.
</p>

<p>
While the preponderance of opinion was that the Negroes do meet their
payments, it may be that experience is still too limited in Chicago and conditions
have thus far been too abnormal to afford the basis for final judgment and
future policy.
</p>

<p>
The first wave of buying by Negroes was stimulated by both Negro and
white real estate agents because many dwellings had been unremunerative for
several years. With the tightening up of the real estate market that ensued,
Negroes became home hunters, and they are continuing to search.
</p>

<p>
There has been a wide variation in the prices paid by Negroes for dwellings.
For some houses Negroes have undoubtedly paid more than could have been
obtained from a white purchaser. One dealer's opinion was that the Negroes
have paid full value. Another said that the Negro never pays higher for
property unless the price is measured by what has been paid for it by white
persons of the "fourth class"â€”referring to property that has descended from
the original owner through three classes of whites before coming into Negro
hands. Many purchases during the last two or three years have been made
direct from the owners. An attempt made by white real estate men to come
to an agreement regarding sales in new districtsâ€”whereby they would turn
over to Negro agents all inquiries as to blocks where Negroes already lived, and
Negro agents would not place Negroes in exclusively white districtsâ€”was
unsuccessful.
</p>

<h4>
III. REAL ESTATE LOANS TO NEGROES
</h4>

<p>
The most formidable stumbling-block in the way of home owning by
Negroes is the unsalability of their mortgages. Except in a limited field these
loans have no market. The Negro demand for home property has become
so large in recent years that the search for it has extended beyond the fringes
of the main existing districts on the South, West, and North sides into the outlying
territory adjoining Negro settlements in Blue Island, Woodlawn, Morgan
Park, and Robbins. How the Negro is to be financed in his effort to improve
his citizenship and home life through home ownership thus becomes a matter
of great concern.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Commission sought to learn from banks, trust companies, brokerage
firms, and similar institutions their experience with Negro clients and property
and their purpose and plans as to future dealings. To thirty such institutions
questionnaires were sent, and twenty-three gave careful replies.
</p>

<p>
Only a few real estate firms that have a large number of Negro clients
have funds available for such loans. These meet but a small part of the demand.
The three banks that have large Negro deposits, the Lincoln State, the
Franklin State, and Jesse Binga's, make such loans when deemed desirable, but
they seem not a large factor in relieving the loan situation. Many of the
banks that are depositories for Negroes' funds do not make loans to them,
giving as their reason that they do not lend on the class of property purchased
by Negroes. Some of them have no real estate department. Only three
of the downtown investment bankers make no restrictions regarding Negro
borrowers that are not common to all; they have dealt with Negro clients for
many years and have found them entirely satisfactory. Possibly one reason
for this is that they educate their buyers of mortgages concerning the value of
these loans; and thus have succeeded, they say, in overcoming many objections
based upon race prejudice.
</p>

<p>
Most large real estate firms and loan companies decline to make loans on
property owned or occupied by Negroes. With some of them this is a blanket
provision that covers generally property in changing or depreciated districts.
Difficulty of disposing of such mortgages is one of the commonest reasons
given for refusing to handle them.
</p>

<p>
Even among the agencies that handle such loans opinion is not unanimous
on fundamental points involved. The Commission asked several brokers
representing large interests this question: "Does your experience indicate
that loans up to 50 per cent of the valuation on property in the residence
districts from Twenty-sixth to Sixtieth streets and from State Street to the lake
have a safe-and-sound investment value?" Among those favorable to Negroes
the answer of Yondorf &amp; Company, a downtown firm, is perhaps typical:
It is necessary to consider each house separately, as conditions vary widely;
consideration must be given to future uses of the property, the present condition
of the improvements, and especially the stability of the person asking for
the loan. As a general rule, loans on old residence property are not as good
as those on houses in new districts; on an old house about $1,000 would be
loaned on a market value of $5,000, whereas in new districts the contractor can
borrow up to two-thirds of the cost of the house; no conscious discrimination
is made in the nature of higher rates because a borrower happens to be a Negro;
careful consideration is given to the margin of safety, and safeguards are
arranged in the way provided for payments.
</p>

<p>
Lionel Bell, another downtown loan broker, regarded this general type of
mortgages on old residence property as fully secured, and does not hesitate to
recommend mortgages in the district mentioned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
</p>

<p>
John A. Schmidt, who handles a large number of loans on Negro property
in that district, considers them of high value, though the risks are both physical
and moral; it is essential to know both the client and the property; the amount
of the loan asked on Negro property usually is not high as compared with its
value. No distinction is made as to the color of the borrower, the condition
and value of the property being the only basis for the loan; loans to Negroes
are less in amount than to whites, though clients thus far accepted are commonly
found satisfactory; the period of payment is about the same, varying
between three and five years, according to the amount paid monthly, the kind
of property involved, and so on. The usual range of amounts requested was
one-third to one-half of the value of the property.
</p>

<p>
R. M. O'Brien &amp; Company, an active South Side real estate firm which
also deals largely in Negro mortgages, found that the average amount loaned
to Negroes was smaller, and that it is a smaller percentage of the value of the
property than in the case of loans to whites, and that the average period for
loans to Negroes was three years.
</p>

<p>
Mead &amp; Coe, another real estate firm, found that the Negroes usually are
allowed $1,000 to the white man's $1,500; that only 35 per cent of the value
of the property is loaned to the Negro, whereas 50 per cent is granted to whites.
Maximum time of loan was five years for the white and three years for the Negro.
</p>

<p>
The Chicago Trust Company answered that the same requirements were
made of white and Negro; the range was from $2,000 to $6,000, limited to 50
per cent of conservative valuation, and five years.
</p>

<p>
In general it was found that property values in the districts where Negroes
usually buy are affected by more factors than is the property in districts where
whites usually buy. Where Negroes are buying the majority of white people
are renting.
</p>

<p>
It was sought to find out whether Negroes ask for renewals more often than
do white borrowers; whether there was any marked difference between Negroes
and other racial groups in the promptness of making payments, in asking for
additional time, in the difficulty of collections, and in compelling foreclosure.
Comparison of Negroes and whites was found to be difficult because of differences
between various nationalities as to repaying loans. The Poles pay
promptly when dealing through loan companies or banks conducted by
Poles. The Italians are eager to get their property cleared. Jews are likely
to ask for renewals and to expect the property to pay the mortgage out of
earnings. The Negroes pay if they can, but sometimes have difficulty because
they have arranged heavy payments on their contracts; during the period of
high wages there has been little trouble, but the feeling was that as yet there
had been no real test. Speaking generally, a representative of Yondorf &amp;
Company said it was estimated that only about 25 per cent of working people
are thrifty and save anything; 75 per cent save nothing; and that proportion
holds true of the Negroes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Firms that deal with Negroes ask for no larger reduction when a Negro
renews his loan, they say, than when a white person renews if the character of
the property is the same. The facts as to the reliability, character, and standing
of the borrower are established when the loan is first made. Negroes buy
old properties where deterioration is rapid, and when the renewal is asked the
value of the property has fallen in proportion. White persons do not buy the
same class of property. So it is necessary to ask the Negro to reduce his
mortgage considerably, except when his property is in a location of newer
houses, such as Morgan Park or Woodlawn.
</p>

<p>
Difficulty is experienced by mortgage bankers and brokers in selling Negro
mortgages to white clients. Yondorf &amp; Company declared that while their
old clients would buy regardless of the color of the borrower, others had to be
convinced of the value of the property and of the earning power and stability
of the Negro borrower. The Negro mortgages are usually for smaller amounts
and hence within the reach of small investors. When white investors find
that Negroes' loans are promptly paid they continue to buy such securities.
</p>

<p>
Lionel Bell reported some difficulty in selling Negro mortgages to white
clients, though he generally succeeded, by showing their value and by inspection,
that the Negroes were keeping their houses in good condition as to both
sanitation and repair.
</p>

<p>
E. A. Cummings &amp; Company have difficulty in selling such mortgages
because many of their clients are out-of-town buyers who are suspicious of
Negro property.
</p>

<p>
E. and S. Lowenstein find no market for such loans; non-resident buyers
and even local buyers fight shy of Negro property in particular, and property
in general that is undesirable because of overcrowding and consequent hard usage.
</p>

<p>
In general, the refusals to buy Negro loans are due to feeling against the
Negro, a disbelief in the Negro's ability to pay them, and distrust of the old
properties which Negroes commonly buy. The opinion was general that anything
which would tend to stabilize values on the South Side, especially in
the lower part of the district occupied by Negroes, would be desirable; that
improvements such as the widening of South Park Avenue would aid materially.
</p>

<p>
Real estate men who have Negroes for clients are finding it advantageous
to educate them in the meaning of mortgages, in the method of issuing and
renewing them, and in what is expected of the mortgagor and what the mortgagor
may expect. When the Negro is carefully informed of the processes
involved in financing the purchase of a home, and the terms are thoroughly
understood, there is much less likelihood of losing his property. Friendly
real estate men are constantly helping Negroes to carry their mortgages and to
find means of renewing when that contingency arises. It is helpful also to
remind Negroes of the necessity of paying their taxes and meeting other obligations
promptly, and of keeping their property in good condition. Some firms
stated that the "natural honesty of the Negro and his love of home life" have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
been fostered by thoughtful friends and leaders, as well as by those who have
business transactions with him. This pays dividends in better citizenship.
</p>

<p>
<i>Widening the market for Negro loans.</i>â€”The white people need to know the
obstacles in the path of the Negro who wishes to establish a good home for
his family and thus improve his citizenship and serve as a good example to
others of his race. How to finance Negro home buyers is a large difficulty in
solving the Negro housing problem. The Commission held a conference
devoted almost entirely to this topic, at which various experts and authorities
were consulted. It was sought to ascertain the fundamentals for meeting the
needs of the future, assuming that the Negro population in Chicago is likely
to continue in normal growth, and that the demand for adequate housing for
the Negro population is not likely to lessen for several years. Particular
attention was given to the question of how a market might be created for the
Negro's loans.
</p>

<p>
An appraiser for the Fort Dearborn National Bank suggested that a system
involving partial payments represented by $25 bonds paying semiannual
interest might be helpful. Bonds of such low denominations might, he thought,
be purchased by Negroes. By such a system Negroes would learn to invest
their money wisely, and by putting money into substantial securities would
encourage real estate investments. These securities could be sold by Negro
bankers and real estate brokers. But he expressed confidence that not a few
white people would buy bonds of that character. They would be based on
about 60 per cent of the value of the property.
</p>

<p>
One real estate broker averred that success in financing Negro home buyers
would be contingent upon creating definite districts in any portion of the city
where the colored men may find it necessary to live in order to be able to reach
their business or their place of employment, districts to be known as their
exclusive territory. Then it would be possible to go to a mortgage loan house
and present a definite case when a mortgage falls due. Knowing that the
property was that of a Negro, and knowing the district, one would have a
definite basis for estimating future increase or depreciation of value. It was
his opinion that white people would support a market of that nature, because
it would not only protect the colored man and the white man alike but all of
the property interests of the city. He disclaimed any desire to promote
segregation. But he maintained that so long as the races mixed, clashes were
inevitable, and that the problem of selling Negro loans, erecting houses, and
renewing mortgages would solve itself under this plan, "because white men
will be very glad to come to the assistance of colored."
</p>

<p>
It happens, however, that some subdivisions developed "especially for
Negroes" present low standards as well as exploitation. One such subdivision
is called Lilydale. An investigator reported on it as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Lilydale is on a flat prairie and was laid out as a subdivision for Negro residents
near the corner of Ninety-fifth and State streets several years ago. It is about five
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
blocks square. The developer is a prominent white real estate dealer active in subdivision
property generally. Another well-known real estate man, who is also a
prominent local politician, is interested in establishing a Negro colony on this property.
The latter is agent for a great deal of property on the South Side tenanted by Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Many Negroes purchased lots in Lilydale at fairly high prices, considering that
virtually no improvements had been made to the property. Water has since been
laid in some of the streets and some of them are supplied with sewers, but there is
no paving and no lighting. Sidewalks are few, mud holes many. Yards, streets,
and alleys are unkempt.
</p>

<p>
Those who promoted the subdivision set up the shells of a few houses, mainly of
the bungalow type. Most of these were sold and the inside finish was supplied by
the purchasers. Most of these sale houses, though, remain unfinished. The building
of houses in Lilydale has been half-hearted, and most of the structures are so poorly
constructed that they are conspicuously uncomfortable. Some of these were built by
piecemeal with any kind of waste building material that could be gathered. The
people in this isolated community apparently are making the best of a hopeless situation.
They express a desire to recover the money they have invested. Provisions
are obtained from two or three small stores. There is a church in the vicinity, but
at the time of the investigation no services were being held in it. The children attend
a branch of the Burnside School, which is conveniently located. The teacher is a
Negro woman, a graduate of a southern normal school. She reported that there is
apparently no prejudice between the white and Negro children; that their only differences
are those to which all children fall heir. She regards the Negro colony of Lilydale
as a bad mistake and would discourage other Negroes from making purchases
there. She regards the investment there as of doubtful value.
</p>

<p>
There is a car line on Ninety-fifth Street which connects with the industries of
South Chicago, where a number of the men of Lilydale are employed.
</p>

<p>
Adding to the loneliness of the general aspect is the fact that most of the surrounding
area is still what is termed "acreage."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Pertinent also is the statement of a man who for years has been interested
in the housing difficulties of Negroes.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Some people have suggested taking a vacant piece of property and building it up
for colored occupancy, but there is the biggest hubbub raised when any such attempt
is made. People complain: "You will ruin this whole neighborhood! You will ruin
the street car line! Everything out in that neighborhood will be ruined all along the
street, because if you build up a colored neighborhood in any one particular location
nobody else will want to go out that way." So that I have come to the point where
I say there is no solution. I can't do anything. I'd have been willing to put in a
million dollars in property anywhere where there would have been a chance to get
5 per cent return on my money. There isn't any use in doing a thing that isn't economically
sound. I wanted to bring this up to show that I had given it some thought,
and that I am very desirous of having somebody make a suggestion that is feasible
so that something can be done.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The difficulty of disposing of loans in a district inhabited by Negroes was
touched upon by a loan expert from the Chicago Trust Company, which handles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
such loans. The trouble, he thought, centers on the character of the
property and of the district, rather than on the fact that the property happened
to be owned or occupied by Negroes. He said that even Negro investors
object to property in such a district for the reason that it is old, little in demand,
and generally a poor risk. He suggested the possibility of small mortgage
bond issues with separate notes. This would save the expense of printing the
bonds, which is considerable at present prices, and the investor would be
afforded the same security. He also suggested having "baby" bonds printed
in standard form, so that they could be simply filled in, thus saving expense.
</p>

<p>
Another real estate broker who had dealt in mortgages of South Side
Negroes for a number of years declared that the average mortgage buyer seems
to prefer those on new bungalows where the margin of security is less than
that on property in the Negro district. Since the bungalow's cost of construction
was less, the chance of revenue under adverse circumstances would be
less. He maintained that a ten- or twelve-room apartment house in the
Second Ward (South Side) affords a better margin of security than the ordinary
cheap bungalow, and that it was therefore a question of educating mortgage
buyers on the question of security. The best evidence on this, he maintained,
would be the number of foreclosures. He had never had to foreclose with
Negroes in the fifteen years of his experience. In that time only two contracts
had been forfeited, both because of disputes between the heirs and the buyers.
His firm had, however, made new contracts when illness or other adverse
circumstances had halted payments, thus allowing the buyers to start over
again. Means had also been taken to see that buyers paid their taxes, in
which process they had required education. White people must be depended
upon to buy the Negro's loans. Very few Negroes buy loans. Their tendency,
he said, is to invest in a home earlier in their career than the white people, and
they buy as soon as they have accumulated enough to make the initial
payment.
</p>

<p>
According to a bank appraiser's opinion Negroes do not understand values,
and they are often led to purchase a building at much more than its worth.
In consequence the amount of loans they need is much greater than it ought
to be. He had not found, however, that the Negroes allow their property to
deteriorate unduly. A different situation had been found where white people
lease to Negroes.
</p>

<p>
According to some real estate dealers, there are cases where houses are
allowed to deteriorate, where the payment has been larger than the purchaser
could carry conveniently. But "after he has taken care of the payment and
has his deed, he will give attention to the improvement of the house." Others
agreed that the Negro mortgage debtor is quite as reliable as a white debtor
of the same class.
</p>

<p>
The president of the Cook County Real Estate Board suggested that one
means of creating a market for Negro loans would be the passage of the "Home
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
Loan Bank Bill." Its provisions are that no loan would be made in excess of
$5,000, but loans would be made up to 80 per cent of the fair value of the
property. Many of the loan houses, he declared, do not consider small loans,
a fact confirmed by the Commission. He cited one house that will not consider
a loan of less than $500,000. For this reason he suggested that this business
should be handled by the building and loan associations, since they do business
on a smaller margin of operating cost and he regarded them as the proper
media for finding suitable markets for Negro mortgages.
</p>

<p>
Involved in the plan for funding the Negro's loans was the question of
segregation. It has been maintained that not much financing could be expected
from white people unless boundaries were allotted to the Negroes, so that
investors in loans would know definitely what to expect. Opinions, of course,
differed on segregation. It was admitted that a spreading out of the Negro
population in Chicago is to be expected, that Negroes can hardly be expected
to remain in the districts in which they have hitherto virtually segregated
themselves. But the opinion was also given that their tendency is to remain
among and near their own people.
</p>

<h4>
IV. FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF NEGROES
</h4>

<p>
The chief concern of investors, brokers, and real estate dealers is as to the
ability of Negroes to meet obligations. There is a common belief, not shaken
even by the satisfactory experiences of those who have dealt with them, that
Negroes have no financial resources, and are thriftless and improvident. Inasmuch
as a large part of the present housing difficulty hinges upon this point,
the Commission made inquiries as to the thrift of Negroes. A group of large
banks in the "Loop" and in neighborhoods of Negro residents were asked to
give their experiences with Negroes as depositors and investors. In spite of
contrary opinion it appears that the resources of Negroes in Chicago are
astonishingly large. In the summer of 1920 in one of the South Side banks
operated by white men Negroes had deposits of $750,000. One banker told of a
Negro banker who sold among the Negroes a bond issue of $150,000 on an old
building on Wabash Avenue, paying solicitors 10 per cent commission to make
sales. The savings deposits in his bank recently had grown very materially.
It was his experience that only a few Negroes buy bonds. They only inquire
casually about them.
</p>

<p>
The sales manager for bonds at a large savings bank, however, told of the
sale of $3,000 worth of bonds to a Negro woman who paid for them from a roll
of bills of $10 to $50. Another "downtown" broker told of a Negro porter
in a "Loop" hotel, who recently loaned $6,000 through his firm.
</p>

<p>
The information as to Negro deposits, sought by the Commission, was
provided by seven trust and savings banks, three state banks, two national
banks, and one trust company. These were able to isolate and check up their
Negro deposits. One of the banks had $1,500,000 on deposit for Negroes;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
another $1,000,000. Still another had 4,000 Negro depositors. A state bank
had $650,000 on deposit for Negroes, another $150,000 and one of the national
banks had $47,000.
</p>

<p>
The average deposits of the Negroes are not so large as those of all the
depositors. The comparison, however, reveals a fair proportion when it is
considered that there are many very large individual depositors and business
houses among the whites. This is how the amounts run, by institutions:

<p>
It was the almost unanimous report that Negroes are more likely to withdraw
their accounts than are white people, that their accounts are less permanent.
In two instances only was the opinion expressed that they were about
the same with both races.
</p>

<p>
Accompanying the questionnaire to banks was a list of questions concerning
real estate loans. One of these was: "Does your bank make loans to Negroes
on real estate, collateral, commercial paper, or personal notes?" All except one
of the trust and savings banks replied in the affirmative. One of the state
banks buys commercial paper on proper security, but not real estate loans
because of the difficulty in selling them. One of the national banks buys
commercial or collateral paper on its merits, without regard to color. Indeed,
it appears that no color line is drawn in this line of business except by the
few institutions that decline all loans to Negroes.
</p>

<p>
In general it was found that the Negroes are showing strong tendencies to
open bank accounts, that they are steadily improving in the amount of deposits
made, in the steadiness of their accounts, and in thrift in general. However,
it appears that in only a few of the banks are they welcomed and in most of
them they are only tolerated. In banks located in neighborhoods in which
Negroes live there is an amazing number of Negro depositors, who receive,
as a rule, friendly advice and help in their financial transactions. Thus
Negroes are taught banking formalities, while thrift is encouraged, and a
good spirit is developed among the white employees toward Negro depositors.
In some instances, however, Negroes, like their white brothers, show suspicion
of banking institutions when they have suffered losses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It appears also that, in addition to the growing desire to invest in homes
of their own, Negroes are showing a strong tendency to engage in business
ventures. They are developing insurance companies, co-operative stores,
retail stores of various kinds, and kindred enterprises.
</p>

<p>
<i>Negroes' lack of opportunities for banking experience.</i>â€”In order to carry
forward successfully their business undertakings Negroes need practical
personal experience and training in banking and financial methods. Yet there
is a strong tendency to bar Negroes from employment in banks, except as
porters or in some unskilled capacity, and they are thus denied the experience
needed in solving financial problems among their own race.
</p>

<p>
Bankers were asked: "If Negroes competent to learn practical banking
were available, could you employ them?" Here are some of the condensed
replies:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. Other employees would refuse to co-operate with them and associate with
them.
</p>

<p>
2. They are not reliable as a rule.
</p>

<p>
3. Do not think so.
</p>

<p>
4. Yes.
</p>

<p>
5. No.
</p>

<p>
6. We have no objections beyond the fact that 95 per cent of our depositors are
white; consequently we would not care to employ colored tellers or clerks in handling
their business.
</p>

<p>
7. We could not have them in clerical positions.
</p>

<p>
8. In a general way we feel that the employment of Negroes by banking institutions
would cause trouble with certain classes of our depositors.
</p>

<p>
9. Very difficult to work white and colored in same office or cages. White
customers prefer to have white clerks wait upon them.
</p>

<p>
10. Clerks who were antagonistic to Negroes would bring about constant difficulties
through the misplacing of papers, mistakes, etc., which would seem to be the
fault of the Negroes.
</p>

<p>
11. Have found that a Negro will appear to be strictly honest for a period of
years and then turn around and prove not to be.
</p>

<p>
12. Our section of the city is entirely white, but with a fear of colored invasion.
There is, therefore, a strong prejudice against them. We have only about half a
dozen accounts with colored people. Two of these are in the savings department
and are maintained with large balances. These two customers are thrifty and careful
with their money. The others are not.
</p>

<p>
13. In former years a bank position was eagerly sought and considered exceptionally
good. At present, because of higher salaries which can be offered by concerns
which make greater earnings than banks and can therefore pay more, the banks are
not getting the same high grade of employees. With the former class it would have
been possible to appeal to their sense of duty to help educate the Negroes and to
overcome prejudice. With present conditions it is not likely that this appeal would
have the same effect, and prejudice against Negroes would make trouble in our routine.
</p>

<p>
14. Social factors enter. For instance, banks often have dinners or other events
for or among their employees. No "Loop" hotel would put on an affair for whites
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
and Negroes. There is also the difficulty of washrooms, and lockers, etc., where
prejudiced employees could make a great deal of trouble.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It would seem, then, that there is not much chance for the hundreds of
intelligent Negro high-school and college graduates in Chicago to obtain a
practical education in banking methods through direct experience. Banks
owned by Negroes are few and small, and there is scarcely any opportunity to
obtain similar experience in Negro building and loan, insurance, and other
companies, which are also limited in number.

CHAPTER VI
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">RACIAL CONTACTS</span>
</h2>

<h3>
INTRODUCTION
</h3>

<p>
Contacts of whites and Negroes in the North and South differ according
to the institutions and traditions of the sections in which they have been reared.
In the South relations are fixed and generally understood, although Negroes
consider the institutions on which these relations are based oppressive and
consistently oppose them. There the "color line" is drawn rigidly without
reference to the desires or comfort of Negroes or the free expression of their
citizenship privileges. Because it is nearer than the North to the institution
of slavery, the South still maintains an almost patriarchal relationship with
its Negro population. Small communities, the plantation system, and the
great numbers of Negroes in domestic service hold the two races steadily in
contacts so close that class as well as race lines are maintained with deliberateness
and persistence. Even where there are no laws specifically regulating
association of the races, the sentiment of the community is enforced, frequently
in disregard of existing general laws. Thus Negroes may not eat in a restaurant
with whites, sit in adjoining seats in a theater, live in the same neighborhoods,
work together on the same jobs, or attend the same schools.
</p>

<p>
In northern communities the institutions are more liberal and with few
exceptions there are no restrictive laws applying specifically to racial association.
In fact, the trend of legislation and of court decisions is strongly toward
adopting and enforcing general regulations without regard to race or color.
Relations are less personal, contacts are wider and more frequent.
</p>

<p>
From a very simple organization of relations in the South, Negroes are
transported to more complex relations based on more elaborate urban distribution
of responsibilities. Thus it happens that whites and Negroes in Chicago
may be found working together in industry, riding together on street cars,
attending the same schools, sharing political activities, with an increasing
number of Negroes holding public office, transacting business in banks, stores,
and real estate, competing in athletics in public schools, colleges, and the
Y.M.C.A., and conferring on social problems in civic and reform clubs.
</p>

<p>
The increasing number of these contacts cannot fail to influence the necessary
adjustments. The general public seems to accept necessary contacts
with a minimum of outward friction, as is shown by thousands of daily contacts.
Each contact, however, where there is friction, is a focus of comment, antagonism,
resentment, prejudice, or fear. But association in such places as hotels,
restaurants, barber shops, dance halls, and theaters is often limited by tradition
and custom in the North as strictly as by regulation in the South.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
</p>

<h3>
A. LEGAL STATUS OF NEGROES IN ILLINOIS
</h3>

<p>
The legal status of Negroes in Illinois differs in no respect from that of
white persons. The limitations which affect Negroes are established through
rules imposed by persons who offer public services and accommodations.
When these rules are unfair, evasive, or even illegal, they can be enforced only
because of non-enforcement of existing laws. Federal and state courts are
in accord in holding Negro men and women in Illinois to be citizens of the
United States and of the commonwealth, protected by the laws against discrimination
or oppression on account of their race or color.
</p>

<p>
There are two lines of decisions in Illinois relating to discriminations on
account of color. One line of cases prohibits discrimination in certain public
places and the other prohibits discrimination against school children. All but
two of these cases were tried since the passage of the School Act and the Civil
Rights Act, prohibiting such discrimination, enacted in 1874 and 1885, respectively.
The civil-rights cases<a name='FA_28' id='FA_28' href='#FN_28' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a> are briefly reviewed below by a consideration
of the school cases.
</p>

<h4>
I. CIVIL RIGHTS IN PUBLIC PLACES
</h4>

<p>
The Civil Rights Act, originally passed in 1885, was amended in 1903,
and again in 1911. Section 1 of this act now provides:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
That all persons within the jurisdiction of said State of Illinois shall be entitled
to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodation, advantages, facilities and
privileges of inns, restaurants, eating houses, hotels, soda-fountains, saloons, barber
shops, bathrooms, theaters, skating rinks, concerts, cafÃ©s, bicycle rinks, elevators,
ice-cream parlors or rooms, railroads, omnibuses, stages, street cars, boats, funeral
hearses, and public conveyances on land and water, and all other places of public
accommodation and amusement, subject only to the conditions and limitations
established by law and applicable alike to all citizens; nor shall there be any discrimination
on account of race or color in the price to be charged and paid for lots
or graves in any cemetery or place for burying the dead, but the price to be charged
and paid for lots in any cemetery or place for burying the dead shall be applicable
alike to all citizens of every race and color.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Section 2 provides:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
That any person who shall violate any of the provisions of the foregoing section
by denying to any citizen, except for reasons applicable alike to all citizens of every
race and color and regardless of color or race, the full enjoyment of any accommodations,
advantages, facilities or privileges in said section enumerated or by aiding or
inciting such denial, shall for every such offense forfeit and pay a sum not less than
$25 nor more than $500 to the person aggrieved thereby, to be recovered in any court
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
of competent jurisdiction in the county where said offense was committed, and shall
also for every such offense be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
thereof, shall be fined not to exceed $500 or shall be imprisoned not more than one
year or both; and <i>provided</i> further, that a judgment in favor of the party aggrieved,
or punishment upon an indictment, shall be a bar to either prosecution respectively.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Anna William</i> v. <i>Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Company</i> (55 Ill. 185)â€”the
first case of color discrimination which reached the supreme court of
Illinoisâ€”was heard in 1870, before the passage of the Civil Rights Act. The
court decided that a railroad company could not exclude a Negro woman on
account of her color from a certain car reserved for the use of ladies. The
evidence showed that the brakeman had refused to permit the Negro woman
to enter the "ladies' car" and pushed her away. The jury awarded her
$200 damages, which the court upheld as reasonable.
</p>

<p>
Before the Amendment of 1903, the Civil Rights Act of 1885 provided
that all persons should be entitled
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodation, advantages, facilities and
privileges of inns, restaurants, eating houses, barber shops, public conveyances on
land or water, theaters, and all other places of public accommodation and amusement,
subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable
alike to all citizens.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In 1896, in <i>Cecil</i> v. <i>Green</i> (60 Ill. App., 61; affirmed, 161 Ill. 265), the court
decided that the expression "all other places of public accommodation"
embraced only places of the same general character as those enumerated,
and therefore that soda fountains were not included within the general term.
</p>

<p>
The amendment of 1903 included soda fountains, saloons, bathrooms,
skating rinks, concerts, bicycle rinks, elevators, and ice-cream parlors.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Baylies</i> v. <i>Curry</i> (30 Ill. App. 105; affirmed, 128 Ill. 36), decided in
1889, a Negro woman, after being refused tickets at the box-office of Curry's
Theater, had a white woman purchase two tickets for her in the balcony.
Upon attempting to use them, the Negro woman and her husband were referred
back to the box-office and their money returned. The proprietor introduced
evidence to show that his theater was in a bad neighborhood, and he had,
therefore, adopted the rule of reserving certain rows for Negroes in each
section of the house. The supreme court, in affirming judgment for $100
damages, said: "Beyond all question, the Civil Rights Act prohibits the
denial of access to the theater and to the several circles or grades of seats
therein, because of race or color."
</p>

<p>
In 1903, in <i>Grace</i> v. <i>Moseley</i> (112 Ill. App. 100), it was held that the statute
imposes liability only where the defendant denies or incites a denial of service,
not where he merely fails to provide service.
</p>

<p>
The amendment of 1911 provided that there should not be any discrimination
on account of race or color in the price charged for lots or graves in any
cemetery.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Relying upon this provision, Gaskill, a Negro, applied for a writ of
mandamus to compel the Forest Home Cemetery Company to receive the
body of his wife for burial (<i>People ex rel. Gaskill</i> v. <i>Forest Home Cemetery
Company</i>, 258 Ill. 36, 1913). The cemetery company had passed a resolution
in 1907 that thereafter the cemetery would be maintained for the burial of
white persons onlyâ€”except that colored persons owning lots in the cemetery,
and their direct heirs, should be admitted for burial. Gaskill did not own
a lot in the cemetery, but four of his children had been buried there fifteen to
twenty years before in single graves separated from each other; and when he
applied in 1912 for space for the burial of his wife, the company refused permission
solely on account of her color.
</p>

<p>
The court held that the 1911 amendment did not prohibit a cemetery
corporation, which did not have the power of eminent domain under its charter
and which had no monopoly of the burial places in its vicinity, from making
and enforcing a rule excluding colored persons from burial in its cemetery.
The case was taken on writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States
(238 U.S. 606), but the writ was dismissed for want of jurisdiction without
further comment.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Dean</i> v. <i>Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Company</i> (183 Ill. App. 317;
1913), Dean, a Negro, recovered damages of $300 from the railway company
for its refusal to allow him to ride in a station elevator because of his color.<a name='FA_29' id='FA_29' href='#FN_29' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a>
</p>

<h4>
II. DISCRIMINATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS
</h4>

<p>
The first school case was decided in 1874, before there was any statute
forbidding discrimination against Negro children in the public schools.<a name='FA_30' id='FA_30' href='#FN_30' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a> In
<i>Chase</i> v. <i>Stephenson</i> (71 Ill. 383; 1874) a taxpayer filed a bill to enjoin the
directors of a school district from maintaining a separate school for Negro
children; and the court held that the directors had no authority to discriminate
on account of color, and the separate school was enjoined.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In March, 1874, "An Act to Protect Colored Children in Their Rights to
Attend Public Schools" was passed which provided:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
That all directors of schools, boards of education, or other school officers, whose
duty it now is or may be hereafter to provide in their respective jurisdictions schools
for the education of all children between the ages of six and twenty-one years, are
prohibited from excluding directly or indirectly any such child from such school on
account of the color of such child.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Two school cases have since arisen at Quincy, Illinois. The first, decided
in 1882 (<i>People ex rel. Longress</i> v. <i>Board of Education of Quincy</i>, 101 Ill. 308),
was a <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding, attacking a regulation of the school board,
requiring all Negro children to attend one school, and excluding them from all
others. The court held that the laws of Illinois prohibited such discrimination
and the board was without authority to make the regulation.
</p>

<p>
In the second Quincy case, decided in 1888 (<i>People</i> v. <i>McFall and Board
of Education of Quincy</i> 26 Ill. App. 319; affirmed, 124 Ill. 642), the petition for
<i>quo warranto</i> charged that the Board of Education had continued the illegal
discrimination against Negro children ever since the decision in the first case.
The petition was supported by a number of affidavits of Negroes. After a
full hearing on affidavits and counter-affidavits the trial court denied the
petition. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, characterizing the
affidavits in support of the petition as "vague and unsatisfactory"; and the
supreme court affirmed the judgment.
</p>

<p>
Quincy has fourteen schools, and the School Board has divided the city into
four school districts. The Lincoln School is exclusively a Negro school and is
the only school in the district in which most of the Negroes live. All white
children in that district are transferred to other schools, and the few Negro
children outside the Lincoln district are urged to attend the Lincoln School.
The Negro teachers and Negro principal of the Lincoln School are paid
higher salaries than other teachers in Quincy, and are told that if they
wish to maintain themselves in the Quincy schools, they must persuade Negro
children in other districts to attend the Lincoln School. In this way the board
has succeeded in confining Negro children with few exceptions to the Lincoln
School. Yet some Negroes are attending five other schools, including the
high school.
</p>

<p>
There have also been two school cases from Alton, Illinois. The first
case was <i>People</i> v. <i>Board of Education of Upper Alton</i> (127 Ill. 613), decided
in 1889. This was a proceeding by mandamus, begun in the supreme court
by John Peair, to compel the Board of Education to admit his two children to
the high school of Upper Alton. Certain issues of fact were certified to the
circuit court for trial by jury. The jury returned a general verdict in favor
of the Board of Education, notwithstanding the following special findings
in answer to questions asked by the relator, John Peair:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Q.</i>: When application was made ... to the principal in charge of the said
building on behalf of relator's two children for permission to attend school in said
building, was such permission refused by said principal because said children were
colored?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: Yes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Q.</i>: Have not the children of relator, John Peair, been excluded from attending
school in said high school building by the defendants on account of the color of said
children?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: Yes.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The supreme court held that the general verdict in favor of the Board of
Education was "so manifestly the result of misdirection by the court as to be
entitled to no consideration," and a writ of mandamus was ordered.
</p>

<p>
The second school case from Alton, though begun in 1899, was not finally
decided until 1908. This was a petition for mandamus filed in the supreme
court by Scott Bibb to compel the mayor and city council of Alton to admit
his children to the Washington School which they had been attending, and from
which he alleged they were excluded on account of color and were transferred
to a school attended only by Negro children. The supreme court certified the
case to the circuit court of Madison County for the trial of certain issues of
facts. Before the supreme court finally ordered the mandamus to issue in
1908 the case had been tried by a jury seven times, had been before the supreme
court five times, and the Bibb children were grown up. It is interesting as a
flagrant example of race prejudice in the trial judge and jury.
</p>

<p>
In this case (<i>People ex rel. Scott Bibb</i> v. <i>Mayor and Common Council of Alton</i>,
233 Ill. 542) the supreme court said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The issues in this case have been tried seven times by juries in the circuit court,
and in two of them the jury disagreed. Upon the first trial where there was a verdict
it was in favor of the respondents, and it was certified to this court. That verdict
was set aside for manifest error prejudicial to the relator in rulings of the court in
the admission of evidence. (<i>People ex rel.</i> v. <i>Mayor and Common Council of Alton</i>,
179 Ill. 615.) There was another trial resulting in a verdict in favor of the respondents,
which was set aside on account of a misdirection of the court in submitting to the jury
a question of law. (<i>People ex rel.</i> v. <i>Mayor and Common Council of Alton</i>, 193 Ill.
309.) Upon another trial there was a third verdict in favor of the respondents,
which this court set aside because clearly contrary to the facts proved and without
any support in the evidence. It was proved at that trial, beyond dispute or controversy,
that the respondents were guilty of the charge contained in the petition, and
the evidence introduced by them had no tendency to prove that the intention clearly
manifested by their acts did not exist. The verdict could only be accounted for as
a product of passion, prejudice or hostility to the law. (<i>People ex rel.</i> v. <i>Mayor and
Common Council of Alton</i>, 209 Ill. 461.) The attorney for relator then urged that a
peremptory writ should be awarded on the ground that the evidence in the record
clearly showed the relator to be entitled to it. The relator, however, had not requested
the circuit court to direct a verdict in his favor, and it was said that if such a motion
had been made the court would doubtless have granted it. The court said that the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
issues were sent to the circuit court for trial in conformity with the practice governing
the trial of issues of fact in actions at law before a jury, and it was not deemed advisable,
in the existing condition of the record, to set aside that order. The case was
sent back for another trial, and upon the next trial the attorney for relator moved
the court to direct a verdict in his favor, and this the court refused to do, assigning
as a reason that this court had directed that the issues be submitted to another jury.
The excuse was so shallow and baseless as to justify a conclusion that it was a mere
pretext to evade a compliance with the law as declared by this court, and the verdict
was set aside and the circuit court directed, in the trial of the questions of fact, to
proceed in accordance with the opinion then filed and the earlier opinions in the case.
(<i>People ex rel.</i> v. <i>Mayor and Common Council of Alton</i>, 221 Ill. 275.) The case has
been again tried, and a verdict in favor of the respondents, unsupported by any
evidence, has been returned to this court. The evidence was to all intents and
purposes the same as upon the former trials, and demonstrated, beyond the possibility
of a doubt, that the children of relator were excluded from the Washington School,
which was the most convenient of the public schools of the city to which they had the
right to be admitted, and that the exclusion was solely on account of their race and
color, and for no other reason whatever. The evidence for the respondents that
nothing was said about schools or colored children by the mayor and council in
changing the ordinances for the purpose of excluding colored children from schools
attended by white children; that the intention to exclude them was not declared,
or that orders were never issued to the police, or that the mayor never intended the
police force under his control to do what they did and what he knew they were doing,
had no tendency whatever to prove that the children of the relator were not excluded
by the respondents on account of their race or color. At the conclusion of the evidence
the attorney for the relator moved the court to direct a verdict finding the issues in
favor of the relator and presented to the court a written instruction for that purpose,
but the court denied the motion and refused to give the instruction. In so doing the
court erred, and the error was in a matter of law, and contrary to the law in this case
as declared by this court in previous opinions filed in the case.
</p>

<p>
The attorney for respondents says that we ought to approve this verdict for the
reason that the questions of fact have been tried seven times in the circuit court;
that the juries have twice disagreed and five juries have decided in favor of the
respondents, and all the trials have been presided over by learned judges. Great
weight is justly given to the conclusion of a jury upon controverted questions of fact
where the verdict appears to be the result of an honest exercise of judgment and the
weighing, with fair deliberation, of the credibility of witnesses, but it is beyond
dispute that this verdict, when viewed in the most favorable light for the respondents,
does not represent any conclusion of the jury from the evidence, and that all of the
verdicts represent nothing but a refusal by juries to enforce a law which they do not
personally approve or which is distasteful to them. In the first opinion filed in this
case it was said that it might be that the wisest of both races believe that the best
interests of each would be promoted by voluntary separation in the public schools,
but that it is no less the duty of courts to enforce the law as it stands, without respect
to race or persons. We would be remiss in our duty to enforce the law and would
forfeit the respect of all law-abiding citizens if we should approve this verdict for no
other reason than because it is one of a series which represent, not the enforcement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
of law or the discharge of duty, but a deplorable disregard for the law and for the rights
of citizens. The verdicts have all been more offensive and dangerous assaults upon
the law, the government, and organized societies, than utterances of individuals
or societies who are opposed to all law, and which are regarded only as the
sentiments of the ignorant, depraved and vicious who are the enemies of a government
of laws. These verdicts were pronounced, not by those who were avowed
enemies of law and government, but by those who constituted a part of the governmental
machinery for the enforcement of the law and who had been sworn
to discharge their duty in that regard. Such verdicts not only denote opposition
to the enforcement of the law, but they also jeopardize the highest interests of
society and individuals. When the law, through the refusal of jurors to regard their
oaths, becomes impotent to protect the rights of the humblest, the rights of no person
are secure; and jurors may take heed that they obey and enforce the law, lest their
refusal to enforce the law for the protection of others becomes effective to deprive
them of their legal rights and substitute the beliefs of jurors and courts as to the
wisdom of laws enacted for their protection. The error of the court in refusing
to direct a verdict is not obviated by the fact that there have been so many verdicts
contrary to the law and the evidence. The verdict must be set aside, and the next
question is whether the issues shall be again sent to the circuit court for trial.
</p>

<p>
In this case the effort to obtain a fair trial of the issues of fact before a jury has
proved utterly futile, and upon the trial now under review the court refused to direct
a verdict in passing upon a question of law raised by the motion of the relator for such
a direction. It is clear that after so many trials there can be no further evidence
produced by either party but that all the evidence relating to the issues is before us.
We are of the opinion that it would be a wrong to the relator to further delay him in
establishing his rights and to compel him to add to the trouble and expense already
incurred in an effort to compel obedience to the law. The verdict of the jury is set
aside and the issues will not be again certified to the circuit court for trial but will
now be finally disposed of. The averments of the petition have been fully proved
upon repeated trials and the evidence is preserved in the record. The evidence
produced by the respondents affords no support to their answer.
</p>

<p>
We therefore find that all the material facts alleged in the petition are true as
therein stated and that the relator is entitled to a writ of <i>mandamus</i> as therein prayed,
and it is therefore ordered that a peremptory writ of <i>mandamus</i> issue according to
the prayer of the petition, that the respondents pay the costs, and that execution
issue therefor.

<h3>
B. CONTACTS IN CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
</h3>

<p>
The public schools furnish one of the most important points of contact
between the white and Negro races, because of the actual number of contacts
in the daily school life of thousands of Negro and white children, and also
because the reactions of young children should indicate whether or not there
is instinctive race prejudice.
</p>

<p>
The Chicago Board of Education makes no distinction between Negro
and white children. There are no separate schools for Negroes. None of the
records of any teacher or principal shows which children are Negroes and which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
white. The board does not know how many Negro children there are in any
school or in the city at large, nor how many of the teachers are Negroes.
It was impossible to obtain from the board, for example, a list of the schools
having a large Negro enrolment with which to begin the investigation. An
unfortunate but unavoidable incidental effect of the investigation was the
focusing of attention of principals and teachers on the Negroes in their
schools.
</p>

<p>
Frequently white teachers in charge of classes with Negro pupils are race
conscious and accept the conduct of white children as normal and pay disproportionate
attention to the conduct of Negro children as exceptional and
distinctive. As a result of the focusing of attention on Negro children, the
inquiry, which was intended to get balanced information, developed a disproportionate
amount of information concerning their conduct as compared
with that of whites. Teachers who considered both races were inclined to
believe that Negro children as a group had no special weaknesses that white
children as a group did not also exhibit; that some Negro children, like any
other children, were good, some were bad, and some indifferent, and that no
generalizations about the race could be made from the characteristics or
attitude of a few.
</p>

<p>
It became evident as soon as the investigation started that it was necessary
to distinguish between the northern and the southern Negro. The southern
Negro is conspicuous the moment one enters the elementary schools. Over-age
or retarded children are found in all the lower grades, special classes, and
ungraded rooms, and are noticeable all the way to the eighth grade, where
seventeen- and nineteen-year-old children are sometimes found. In some
schools these children are found in the regular classes; in others there are
special rooms for retarded children, and as these groups are often composed
almost entirely of Negro children, there is an appearance of segregation which
made necessary a study of these retarded children from the South.
</p>

<p>
The southern child is hampered first of all by lack of educational opportunity
in the South. He is usually retarded by two or more years when he
enters the northern school because he has never been able to attend school
regularly, due to the short term in southern rural schools, distance from school,
and inadequacy of teaching force and school equipment. According to a
report by the United States Bureau of Education on <i>Negro Education</i><a name='FA_31' id='FA_31' href='#FN_31' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a> 90 per
cent of the Negro children between fifteen and twenty years of age attending
school in the South are over-age. Says this report:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The inadequacy of the elementary school system for colored children is indicated
both by the comparisons of public appropriations and by the fact that the attendance
in both public and private schools is only 58.1 per cent of the children six to fourteen
years of age. The average length of the public school term is less than five months
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
in practically all of the states. Most of the school buildings, especially those in the
rural districts, are in wretched condition. There is little supervision and little effort
to improve the schools or adapt their efforts to the needs of the community. The
reports of the state departments of Georgia and Alabama indicate that 70 per cent
of the colored teachers have third grade or temporary certificates, representing a
preparation less than that usually given in the first eight elementary grades. Investigations
made by supervisors of colored schools in other states indicate that the
percentage of poorly prepared colored teachers is almost as high in the other southern
states.<a name='FA_32' id='FA_32' href='#FN_32' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The inadequacy of Negro teachers' salaries is shown by the per capita
expenditure in six southern states for each white and Negro child between
six and fourteen years of age. The salary of the teacher, expressed in per
capita for each child, ranges from $5.27 to $13.79 for white pupils and from
$1.44 to $8.53 for Negro pupils. South Carolina pays its white teachers ten
times as much as its Negro teachers. Alabama pays its white teachers
about nine times as much. In Kentucky the per capita for white and colored
is about the same.<a name='FA_33' id='FA_33' href='#FN_33' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a>
</p>

<p>
Distribution of school funds by counties indicated a decreasing per capita
expenditure for the Negro as the proportion of Negroes in the county increased.

<p>
A southern state superintendent of education is quoted in the report, as
follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There has never been any serious attempt in this state to offer adequate educational
facilities for the colored race. The average length of the term for the state
is only four months; practically all of the schools are taught in dilapidated churches,
which, of course, are not equipped with suitable desks, blackboards, and the other
essentials of a school; practically all of the teachers are incompetent, possessing
little or no education and having had no professional training whatever, except a
few weeks obtained in the summer schools; the schools are generally overcrowded,
some of them having as many as 100 students to the teacher; no attempt is made to
do more than teach the children to read, write, and figure, and these subjects are
learned very imperfectly.<a name='FA_35' id='FA_35' href='#FN_35' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another difficulty was suggested by the principal of a Chicago school
(Webster) where 30 per cent of the children are Negroes, who said: "We
base our educational ideas on certain backgrounds. The curriculum in Chicago
was planned for children who come from families who are educated. It
doesn't take children coming from uneducated families into consideration.
That isn't fair either to the white or colored children."
</p>

<p>
The problem of readjustment to life in a northern city also affects the
child's school life, and he is self-conscious and inclined to be either too timid
or too self-assertive. A Negro teacher in speaking of the difficulties confronting
the southern Negro, as well as the whole Negro group, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The southern Negro has pushed the Chicago Negro out of his home, and the
Chicago Negro in seeking a new home is opposed by the whites. What is to happen?
The whites are prejudiced against the whole Negro group. The Chicago Negro is
prejudiced against the southern Negro. Surely it makes a difficult situation for the
southern Negro. No wonder he meets a word with a blow. And all this comes into
the school more or less.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another Negro teacher thus analyzes further the adjustment problems
which tend to make the Negro newly come from the South unpopular with
the Chicago Negro, as well as with the whites:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
These families from the South usually come from the country where there are
no close neighbors.... Then the family is transplanted to Chicago to an apartment
house, and even in with another family. The whole environment is changed and the
trouble begins. No sense of property rights, no idea of how to use conveniences,
no idea of how to live in the new home, to keep it up, to live with everybody else so
near. On top of that, the father does not fit into his work, and therefore cannot
support the family; the mother goes out to work, and what is the result? Poorly
kept houses and poorly kept children.... A normal home shows itself in the school,
and poor home conditions show up still more.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Negro child born in the North is not found to an unusual extent
among the retarded children. He has been able to enter school on time and
to attend the full term of nine months; his teachers compare favorably with
those in white American and foreign neighborhoods, and his parents as a rule
have a better background. Many teachers say that the progress of northern-born
Negroes compares very favorably with that of whites.
</p>

<h4>
I. PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF SCHOOLS
</h4>

<p>
Since the Board of Education keeps no record of Negro children as such,
it could not furnish a list of the schools having a percentage of Negro children.
Therefore a list was made up of all the schools in the Negro residential areas,
the boundaries of these schools were obtained from the Board of Education,
and the percentage of Negroes in each school district was worked out from the
1920 census figures. The schools listed in Table X were found to be situated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
in districts where the Negro population was 10 per cent or more. The figures
at the right show the approximate percentage of Negro children in the school,
as given by the principal of the school.
</p>

<p>
Fuller School is a branch of Felsenthal and has the same principal; it is
in a neighborhood where the percentage of Negroes is practically the same as
in the neighborhoods around Felsenthal, but there is a very great difference
in the percentage of Negro children in the two schools, according to figures
given by the principal. It appears from this that the principal, who is a
believer in separate schools, places the large majority of the Negro children
in Fuller School. Negroes in the vicinity say that Fuller School is run down
and neglected, that the staff of teachers is below the average, that the school
has no playground of its own but must use the one at Felsenthal, and that all
the unmanageable children are sent there from Felsenthal. It is also believed
by these Negroes that Fuller is used as a feeder for the other schools in the
neighborhoods where there are fewer Negro children.

The points in regard to physical equipment stressed by a district superintendent
in the area containing the largest number of schools attended
mainly by Negroes were: date of erection, an assembly hall located on the
main floor, gymnasium, and, in the congested districts, bathroom and lunchroom.
Table XI shows such facts concerning these schools.

It will be noted that only five of these schools, or 23 per cent, were built
since 1900, and four of these five are in sections where the Negro population
is less than 25 per cent. The ten schools serving the largest percentage of
Negroes were built, one in 1856, one in 1867, seven between 1880 and 1889,
and one between 1890 and 1899. Of the 235 white schools 133, or 56 per cent,
were built after 1899.

Assembly halls and gymnasiums were totally lacking in seven of the
twenty-two schools, and in the remaining fifteen the assembly hall was on the
third or fourth floor, where, according to the district superintendent, it
cannot have maximum use for community purposes. A really useful assembly
hall, he stated, should be on the ground floor, opening directly on the school
yard, and capable of being shut off entirely from the rest of the building so
that it could be lighted and heated separately for evening gatherings. Only
three of these fifteen schools had separate gymnasiums. In the others the
gymnasium was combined with the assembly hall. There was little in the
way of apparatus; what there was consisted mainly of hand apparatus, including
clubs, dumbbells and basket-balls, that could be used in the assembly hall
or the corridors. The district superintendent emphasized the need for gymnasiums
in Negro residential areas because the children were weak physically
and needed special exercises.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Playground space for schools attended largely by Negroes compares
favorably with that for schools attended largely by whites, though Douglas
School (92 per cent Negro), with 1,513 pupils, has only one playground 96Ã—125
feet. Most schools have two playgrounds, one for boys and one for girls.
The only other school having such limited play space as Douglas is a foreign
school, Von Humboldt, where there are 2,500 pupils and the playground is
50Ã—100 feet. Like Douglas, this is a double school with inadequate space
for the children inside the school and outside. Sometimes there is a public
playground near by which relieves the congestion on the school playground
except in the case of Keith School (90 per cent Negro), the principal of which
emphasized the need for a playground near her school.
</p>

<p>
In a group of twenty-four schools, six of which are attended mainly by
Negroes, six mainly by white Americans, and twelve mainly by children of
immigrants, it was found that there was no unusual crowding of classrooms
in those attended mainly by Negroes except in the case of Douglas School.
Conditions were practically the same in the three groups of schools.
</p>

<p>
Indications of overcrowding are the average number of seats in a classroom,
the average number of pupils per teacher, and the double-school or shift
system. There is little variation among the three groups of schools in the
number of seats in the classroom and the number of pupils to each teacher,
except that the school having the largest number of pupils to each teacher
(57) is Colman, 92 per cent Negro. Although there are no double schools
in the group attended mainly by white Americans, one of the six schools
attended mainly by Negroes and five of the schools attended mainly by children
of immigrants are double schools. Under this system, which is a makeshift
in a neighborhood where another school is needed to take care of the children,
the children go to school in two shifts, one shift an hour later than the
other, and leave correspondingly later in the afternoon. Under this arrangement
more children are at the school during the major part of the day than
can be seated in the classroom and the full school curriculum can be carried on
only under pressure, as one group of children must always be hurried on before
the next group appears.
</p>

<h4>
II. SCHOOL CONTACT PROBLEMS
</h4>

<p>
Information as to problems of contact in the schools was gathered from
conferences to which the principals of high and elementary schools were invited,
and by personal visits to the schools. Thirteen elementary schools were visited,
seven of which had an enrolment of less than 50 per cent Negro, and six of
which had an enrolment of more than 50 per cent Negro. The schools with
the smaller percentage were: Drake (30),<a name='FA_37' id='FA_37' href='#FN_37' class='fnanchor'>[37]</a> Felsenthal (20), Forrestville (38),
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
Haven (20), Oakland (26), Webster (30), and Kenwood (a very small
number of Negroes). The schools having a majority Negro were Colman
(92), Doolittle (85), Douglas (93), Farren (92), Keith (90), and Moseley (70).
</p>

<p>
The high schools visited were Englewood, Hyde Park, and Wendell Phillips.
In Englewood and Hyde Park the percentage of Negroes was very small,
while in Wendell Phillips the Negro children were about 56 per cent of the enrolment.
</p>

<p>
The opinions of principals and teachers about Negro children are a cross-section
of public opinion on the race question with all its contradictions and
irritations. It must therefore be borne in mind in reading this section on school
contacts that whether Negro children are reported good or bad, bright or dull,
quarrelsome or amiable, whether antagonism and voluntary grouping or their
lack are reported, there is an inevitable tendency for the teacher to see the
facts in the light of any prejudice or general views she may have on race
relations.
</p>

<p>
It was thought, for example, that for the purposes of this discussion the
schools could be put in two general groups: those with less than 50 per cent
Negroes and those with more than 50 per cent Negroes. But it was immediately
apparent that no generalizations could be made on the basis of the percentage
of Negro children in the schools, because sometimes two principals of
schools having the same proportion of Negro pupils reported widely different
experience with reference to friction; and in some cases principals of schools
with a small percentage of Negroes reported friction, while other principals
of schools with a larger percentage reported harmonious relations. The most
important factor determining the attitude of the teachers in a school was
invariably the attitude of the principal. Though there were many cases where
individual teachers held views entirely different from those of the principal,
yet the attitude of the principal was usually reflected in the expressed opinion
of the teachers and in the atmosphere of the school.
</p>

<p>
But there is no explanation for total disagreement between two teachers in
the same school as to whether or not there is race friction in the school
except difference in points of view on the race problem. This factor is to be
taken into consideration in weighing the testimony of teachers regarding
school contacts of the races.
</p>

<p>
The attitude of some of the principals and teachers was revealed in their
fear that their schools, with 20 per cent or 30 per cent Negro children, would
be regarded as largely Negro schools. The principal of a school with 30 per
cent Negro children considered it an insult to be asked to have his school
take part in a song festival with schools largely attended by Negroes. A
teacher in a school 26 per cent Negro was much incensed because the Board
of Education had sent Negroes to the school to talk to the children on cleaning
up the neighborhood. She said that the white children did not seem to mind
and listened interestedly; it was the teachers who considered it an outrage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
that Negroes should come to "tell a community seven-eighths white to clean
up."
</p>

<p>
Since the elementary schools and high schools present rather different
problems, due to the greater number of social activities in the latter, it was
decided to consider the two groups separately.
</p>

<h5>
1. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS
</h5>

<p>
The contacts in the elementary schools fall naturally under three heads:
classroom contacts, building and playground contacts, and social contacts.
</p>

<p>
<i>Classroom contacts.</i>â€”There was much less variety of opinion in regard to
classroom contacts than the other two. Most teachers agreed that there was
little friction so far as school work was concerned, even when it meant sitting
next to one another or in the same seats. Most kindergarten teachers found
the most natural relationship existing between the young Negro and white
children. "Neither colored nor whites have any feeling in our kindergarten,"
said one principal in a school 30 per cent Negro (Webster); "they don't
understand the difference between colored and white children." In visiting
one school the investigator noticed that the white children who objected to
holding hands with the Negro children in the kindergarten and first and
second grades were the better-dressed children who undoubtedly reflected the
economic class and race consciousness of their parents. The Armour Mission
near the school had excluded Negroes from its kindergarten, thereby fostering
this spirit among the whites. A teacher in Doolittle (85 per cent) told of a
little white girl in another school who cried because she was afraid the color
from the Negro children's hands would rub off on hers; in her present school
she has known no such instances in the kindergarten. This conduct is paralleled
in instances in which Negro children who have never had any contact
with white children in the South are afraid of them when they first come
North.
</p>

<p>
Most of the teachers in the higher grades reported that there were no signs
of race prejudice in the room. A teacher at Oakland (26 per cent) said that
white girls sometimes asked to be moved to another seat when near a very
dirty Negro child, but that this often happened when the dirty child was white.
This teacher said it was the white mothers from the South, not the children,
who wanted their children to be kept away from the Negroes. "The white
children don't seem to mind the colored," she said. "I have had three or
four mothers come in and ask that their children be kept away from the colored,
but they were women from the South and felt race prejudice strongly. But
they are the only ones who have complained."
</p>

<p>
A teacher in a school 90 per cent Negro said that when doubling up in
the seats was necessary whites and Negroes frequently chose each other.
A teacher at Moseley (70 per cent), when the investigator was present, called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
upon a white girl to act as hostess to a Negro girl who had just come from the
South, and the request was met with pride and pleasure by the white girl.
On the same occasion a white boy was asked to help a Negro boy with his
arithmetic, and the two doubled up and worked together quite naturally.
</p>

<p>
"Race makes no difference," declared the principal of a school 92 per cent
Negro (Colman). "The other day I had them all digging in the garden, and
when they were all ready to go in I kept out one colored boy to help me plant
seeds. We could use another boy, so I told Henry to choose anyone out of
two rooms and he returned with an Italian. The color makes no difference."
</p>

<p>
A few instances of jealousy are cited. In one of them resentment ran
high because when a loving cup was presented in McKinley (70 per cent) for
the best composition, it was awarded by a neutral outside jury to a white girl.
The principal of this 70 per cent Negro school, in addition to finding the
Negro children jealous, considered their parents insolent and resentful. On
the investigator's first visit she said that military discipline was the only kind
for children, and that absolute segregation was necessary. At the next interview
she said she preferred her school to any other; that there was never any
disciplinary difficulty, and that white children who had moved from the district
were paying car fare to finish their course at her school.
</p>

<p>
<i>Discipline.</i>â€”There was considerable variety of opinion among the teachers
as to whether Negro children presented any special problems of discipline.
The principal of a school 20 per cent Negro (Felsenthal), for example, said that
discipline was more difficult in this school than in the branch where 90 per
cent were Negroes (Fuller). This principal is an advocate of separate schools.
She was contradicted by a teacher in her school who said she had never used
different discipline for the Negroes. In schools where the principals were
sympathetic and the interracial spirit good the teachers reported that Negro
children were much like other children and could be disciplined in the same
way. One or two teachers reported that Negro children could not be scolded
but must be "jollied along" and the work presented as play. This is interesting
in view of the frequent complaint of the children from the South that the
teachers in Chicago played with them all the time and did not teach them
anything.
</p>

<p>
<i>Attitude toward Negro teachers.</i>â€”Few Negro teachers were found in the
schools investigated.
</p>

<p>
At Doolittle (85 per cent) there were thirty-three teachers, of whom two
were Negroes. There was also a Negro cadet. At Raymond (93 per cent)
there were six Negro teachers and a Negro cadet in a staff of forty. At Keith
(90 per cent) there were six Negro teachers in a staff of twelve. Two of these
principals said that their Negro teachers compared favorably with their white
teachers and that some of them were excellent. Asked whether there was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
much antagonism if a Negro teacher was assigned where all the children were
white, the principal of a 93 per cent school (Raymond) said there had been one
or two such cases. "They are most successful in the foreign districts on the
West Side. The European people do not seem to resent the presence of a
colored teacher."
</p>

<p>
Another principal said that this was especially true where the foreign
element was Jewish. A Negro teacher in a West Side school, largely Italian,
is considered one of the ablest teachers in the school and proved herself highly
competent during the war, when she assisted with the work of the draft board
in the district.
</p>

<p>
One or two principals said that they would not have Negro teachers in
their schools because the white teachers "could not be intimate with colored
teachers," or because Negro teachers were "cocky," or because "the <i>Defender</i>
preaches propaganda for colored teachers to seek positions in white schools."
Sometimes an effort was made to explain the principal's objection to Negro
teachers by saying that Negro children had no respect for Negro teachers.
One principal whose white teachers were rather below the accepted standard
said that the one colored teacher who had been there was obliged to leave
because of the children's protest against her. A Negro teacher in a 20 per
cent school (Haven) was valued highly by the principal, who advised with her
as to what measures could be taken to prevent the appearance of race feeling.
This teacher formerly taught in a school where there were no Negro children
and had experienced no difficulty in either type of school. "The children
just seem to forget I am colored," she said.
</p>

<p>
In Farren School (92 per cent) a teacher of a special room for children
recently arrived from the South expressed the belief that these children "have
a distinct and decided fear of the white teacher and it's up to the teacher to
change this fear into respect." They were very timid at first, she said, due to
the new environment and the contact with so many more people, especially
white. This timidity lasted for about a year and then these children became
more like Chicago children.
</p>

<p>
<i>Building and playground contacts.</i>â€”At six out of the thirteen elementary
schools some friction about the buildings and on the playgrounds was reported,
and none at the other seven schools. On further analysis it appeared that the
friction reported was general at only two of the six schools. At the other
four the instances cited seemed either to involve a few troublesome individuals
or to be quarrels among Negro children rather than between Negroes and
whites. The two schools reporting general antagonism between Negro and
white children had about 30 per cent Negro children. The principals of these
schools said that the white children were dominated by the Negroes and did
not dare stand up for their rights. The testimony of the principal of one of
these schools showed a disposition to regard many acts as characteristically
racial. For example, she needed no further evidence that a Negro boy had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
cut up a white boy's cap than the fact that it was cut with a safety-razor
blade. Although both white and Negro boys commonly carry safety-razor
blades to sharpen their pencils, she thought of razors only in connection with
Negroes. She also believed that "Negro children of kindergarten age are
unusually cruel," and that "Negroes need a curriculum especially adapted
to their emotional natures." Again she said that a Negro boy who asked to
be put back from the third to the first grade, because the third-grade work
was too hard for him, was typical of Negro children, who "shut down on their
intellectual processes when they are about twelve or fourteen years of age."
In view of the numbers of Negro children in the higher grades who are advancing
normally, this is obviously an unwarranted generalization.
</p>

<p class="caption">FARREN SCHOOL
<br />
<span class="s08">Located at Forty-eighth Street and Wabash Avenue, 92 per cent Negro attendance.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
There were some signs of friction at a school 20 per cent Negro (Haven)
when a school largely Italian was combined with it, but the situation
was handled tactfully by the principal and there had been no trouble. At
a school 85 per cent Negro (Doolittle), where the white element was
Jewish, all the teachers reported that there was no antagonism between the
races.
</p>

<p>
<i>Voluntary grouping.</i>â€”The only school where the investigator noticed Negro
and white children playing in separate groups was Webster (30 per cent),
whose principal reported antagonism between Negroes and whites. At the
other schools natural mingling was reported by some teachers or observed
by the investigator. At a school 26 per cent Negro (Oakland) three teachers
said that Negro and white children did not mingle on the playgrounds, while
another teacher said they all played together regardless of color. The principal
and twelve teachers at a school 85 per cent Negro (Doolittle) agreed, with the
exception of one teacher who was a southerner, that there was never anything
but the most natural mingling in the classrooms, about the building and on
the playground. At a school 30 per cent Negro (Drake), the principal of which
stated that the relations between the races were not harmonious, the investigator
observed a free and natural grouping of Negroes and whites of all ages on the
playground. The principal explained that this was "a forced rather than a
natural grouping because of lack of apparatus for all." The white children
at a school 20 per cent Negro (Haven) were Italians, Jews, and Greeks, and all
the races played so naturally together that passersby frequently stopped to
watch them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Social contacts.</i>â€”There are few social organizations and gatherings in the
elementary schools. The principal of a school 93 per cent Negro (Raymond)
said that there were clubs through all the grammar grades and that the friendliness
between the two races was marked, but added:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have not more than fifty or sixty white children in this particular building.
One white child was elected vice-president, the first white child elected in eight years.
It shows the friendly relationship when a white child could be elected to office with
a large preponderance of colored children. A Jewish boy was elected to a smaller
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
office of clerk. The white children are not foreign. In their meetings the question
of color never arises at all.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In a few instances principals had found that graduation presented some
difficulties, as white mothers would appear at the school a few days before
and request that their children do not march with Negro children. "About
the only time I see a white mother is near graduation," said the principal of
a school 38 per cent Negro (Forrestville). "They always say they wouldn't
care for themselves, but a friend might see and they would feel ashamed."
"White children prefer not to march with colored at graduation," said a teacher
at Oakland School (26 per cent), "and mothers sometimes come to ask that it
be so arranged that their girls can march with white girls. They usually say
that for themselves they don't mind, but friends might see and wonder why that
should be."
</p>

<p>
A number of the schools have orchestras or occasional musical programs.
The investigator heard one orchestra of eleven pieces in Doolittle School
(85 per cent), which played remarkably well. All but one of the children
were Negroes. A teacher in Webster School (30 per cent), where there was
reported to be constant friction between Negro and white children, gave an
incident of a Negro boy in the school playing the violin with a white accompanist
and being enthusiastically applauded by the children.
</p>

<p>
The principal of a 92 per cent Negro school (Colman) reported an unpleasant
experience when pupils from her school were invited to take part in a
musical program at a West Side Park.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A group of sixty went with two white teachers in charge. On the way over a
group of foreign women called out insulting remarks to the teachers, but no one paid
any attention. After the program the group started marching out of the park and
were met at the gate with a shower of stones. The teacher told the children to run
for their lives, and they all had to scatter and hide in the bushes in the park or run
toward home if they could. A rough set of boys had got together and were waiting
for those children, stones all ready to throw. Since that time we have never accepted an
invitation to sing outside our own neighborhood. Invitations have come from time to
time, but the children all come with excuses. All of them, children and parents throughout
the neighborhood, are afraid but you can't get anyone to come out and say it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Attitude of parents.</i>â€”Principals and teachers were questioned about their
relations with the parents of both Negro and white childrenâ€”whether they
received co-operation from the parents in matters of discipline; what was the
attitude of the parents toward Negro teachers; and whether many requests
were received from Negro or white parents for transfers to schools where
there were fewer Negroes.
</p>

<p>
In general it may be said that the principals who found Negro parents
unco-operative, unambitious, and antagonistic were those who believed in
separate schools, found Negro children difficult to discipline, and would have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
no Negro teachers in their schools. Such principals declared that Negro
parents were "10 to 1 in the complaints brought into the office,"<a name='FA_38' id='FA_38' href='#FN_38' class='fnanchor'>[38]</a> and that
"they fuss over everything and tell their children not to take anything from a
white child." They also cited cases of insolence and threats which appeared
to be exceptional rather than typical.
</p>

<p>
Some teachers said the reason they did not receive any co-operation from
Negro mothers was because a large proportion of them were working. Tardiness
and absence were due mainly to this cause, according to one principal,
though a teacher of a room for retarded children in another school said there
was little tardiness and practically no absence in her group. This teacher
expressed the conviction, as did many others, that Negro parents were
appreciative of school advantages and eager to have their children learn.
Principals who came in contact with both Negro and foreign parents found
the Negro parents much more interested and ambitious than the foreigners.
Even the principal of a school 30 per cent Negro (Webster), who was somewhat
prejudiced in her attitude toward Negroes in the school, said she had more
Negro than white boys able to go to work whose parents wished them to remain
in school.
</p>

<p>
Negro teachers were apparently acceptable to Negro parents, only one
of the principals or teachers interviewed reporting objections by Negro parents.
One teacher in a school 30 per cent Negro (Webster) said that Negro parents
had their children transferred there from schools with more Negroes, so that
they would have white teachers. The district superintendent said he had had
some difficulty in placing Negro teachers in Negro schools, which he attributed
to the fact that Negro parents felt that Negro teachers had not had the same
opportunity for thorough training as white teachers. Some Negro parents,
however, had indicated that their attitude was not due to belief that Negro
teachers were inadequately trained, but to fear that too general placing of
Negro teachers over Negro pupils was a step toward segregation.
</p>

<p>
The principal of a school 90 per cent Negro (Keith) thought Negro mothers
preferred Negro teachers because several had said to her that the "colored
teachers understand our children better."
</p>

<p>
The district superintendent in the area including most of the schools
largely attended by Negroes said that few requests for transfers were made
during the year, but he believed more were made at the request of Negro
than of white parents. A number of these Negro children transferred not to
go to a school largely white but to a school 70 per cent Negro, because they
said they were afraid to go to the school in their own district which was across
Wentworth Avenue. The race feeling between certain groups in this district
was very intense, according to the superintendent. It was especially violent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
between the Negro children and the Italians and between the Jews and the
Bohemians. The principal of a school 93 per cent Negro (Raymond) also
testified to the spirit of antagonism along Wentworth Avenue:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Wentworth Avenue is the gang line. They seem to feel that trespass on either
side of that line is ground for trouble. While they will admit colored members to
the school without any trouble for manual training, they have to be escorted over the
line, because of trouble, not from members of the school, but groups of boys outside
the school. To illustrate: We took a kindergarten group over to the park. One
little six-year-old girl was struck in the face by a man. The condition is a tradition.
There does not seem to be any malice in it. "He is from the east side," or "Hit him,
he is from the West Side," are remarks frequently heard.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Transfers from schools with a predominant Negro membership were
reported by one or two principals and teachers in schools with a Negro minority,
who said that the Negro mothers objected to having their children in schools
"where there are so many common niggers." One of the principals said she
had many requests from Negro mothers for transfers from the branch of the
school with 90 per cent Negroes to the main school with 20 per cent. The
Commission did not find in its inquiry among Negro mothers that such an
objection was prevalent, but that most of the transfers requested were due to
the reputation of the school for being overcrowded, poorly taught, and generally
run down.
</p>

<h5>
2. HIGH SCHOOLS
</h5>

<p>
<i>Classroom and building contacts.</i>â€”In the high schools the ordinary contacts
in classes and about the building become subordinate to the more difficult
problems created by the increased number of social activitiesâ€”athletics,
gymnasium exhibitions, clubs, and parties.
</p>

<p>
The dean of Englewood High School, which has only about 6 per cent
Negro children, said that the white and Negro children mingled freely with
no sign of trouble or prejudice but thought that if more Negro children came
to the school the spirit would change. A teacher in this same school who had
formerly been at Wendell Phillips, where the majority are Negro, said that
a spirit of friendliness had grown up there between the two races, and race
distinction had disappeared.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-365" id="i-365"></a>

<p class="caption">WENDELL PHILLIPS HIGH SCHOOL
<br />
<span class="s08">Located at Thirty-ninth Street and Prairie Avenue, 52 per cent Negro attendance.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
There was only one Negro teacher in the high schools of Chicago at the
time of this investigation, the teacher of manual training at Wendell Phillips.
He is a graduate of the University of Illinois and had substituted around
Chicago for several years. Although they spoke very highly of him, none of the
principals of three high schools with small Negro percentages and in which
there were vacancies could use him. The principal of Wendell Phillips, with
a large proportion of Negroes, told, however, of a different experience when
this teacher was at that school. "In answer to complaints by pupils I told
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
them that this man was a graduate of the University of Illinois, a high-school
graduate in the city, and a cultured man. 'Go in there and forget the color,
and see if you can get the subject matter.' In the majority of cases it worked."
</p>

<p>
Racial friction about the buildings and grounds was not reported by any
of the high-school principals. "I have not known of a fight between a colored
and a white boy in fifteen years," said the principal of Hyde Park.
</p>

<p>
Two principals said that the Negro children voluntarily grouped themselves
at noon, either eating at tables by themselves in the lunchroom or bringing
their own lunches and eating in the back part of the assembly hall. The
gymnasium instructor at Wendell Phillips said that she had no difficulty in
her work if she let the children arrange themselves. The gymnasium instructor
at a school with a small proportion of Negroes said that the white girls had
objected to going into the swimming-pool with Negro girls, but that she had
gone in with the Negro girls, which had helped to remove the prejudice.
</p>

<p>
<i>Athletic teams.</i>â€”In the field of athletics there seems to be no feeling between
the white and Negro members of a school team, but the Negro members are
sometimes roughly handled when the team plays other schools. "The basketball
team is half and half," said the principal of Wendell Phillips. He reported
some friction in previous years but said that "this year it is not shown at all."
"They played a strenuous game with Englewood last week. A colored boy
was roughly treated by the other team. Our white boys were ready to fight
the whole Englewood team."
</p>

<p>
The principal of Hyde Park High School also said that there was no
feeling in his school against Negro members of athletic teams, and that he did
not know of a single instance in which a Negro boy was kept off an athletic team
if he was the best for the place.
</p>

<p>
Two Seniors in a high school mainly white (Tilden) thus described the way
they handled the Negro members of a visiting basket-ball team:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
On the way over here fellows on the outside bawled them out, but our fellows
sure got them on the way home. There were three black fellows on the team and those
three got just about laid out. Our team wouldn't play them, so there was a great
old row. Then, when they went home some of our boys were waiting for them to
come out of the building to give them a chase. The coons were afraid to come out,
so policemen had to be called to take them to the car line. The white fellows weren't
hurt any, but the coons got some bricks.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Transfers between high schools.</i>â€”Requests for transfers from Wendell
Phillips to Englewood and Hyde Park schools had been made by both white
and Negro children, according to the principals of the latter schools. The
permits of the Negro children had frequently been revoked after they had
been admitted to classes, and the children returned to Wendell Phillips.
A teacher at Wendell Phillips pointed out the injustice of transferring a child
in the middle of a term. After a child has been admitted to classes he should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
be permitted to remain through the semester, she believed, for otherwise a
full term's work was lost because the courses in the schools were different.
"All this transferring is nonsense, anyway," she said. "Children should be
made to go to school in the district where they live and that would end the
trouble."
</p>

<p>
This teacher told of an incident at Tilden School when a group of Negro
boys registered for entrance:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
About sixty colored boys entered Tilden High School either for the regular
high-school course or prevocational work and were thrown out by the Tilden boys.
They made it so hot for the colored boys that the sixty had to withdraw. Some
came back here; others dropped out of school entirely. It's pretty bad when one
set of boys can put out another set and nothing is done to punish one and call back
the other group.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Two boys at Tilden who took part in this affair gave this version of the
incident:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
About thirty colored boys registered at Tilden last fall, but we cleaned up on them
the first couple of days and they never showed up again. We didn't give them any
peace in the locker room, basement, at noon hours, or between classesâ€”told them to
keep out of our way or we'd see they got out. The fellows who were in school before
we didn't tackleâ€”they know where they belong. There's one colored fellow in our
class everybody likes. He's a smart nice fellow to talk to, and he doesn't stick around
when you don't want him. He didn't say anything when we made the new coons
step around, but I guess he didn't like it very well.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It was this same group of boys who objected to playing a visiting basketball
team with three Negroes on it and "just about laid them out."
</p>

<p>
<i>Social activities in high schools.</i>â€”In high schools, with their older pupils,
there is an increased race consciousness, and in the purely social activities
such as clubs and dances, which are part of high-school life, there is none of
the general mingling often found in semi-social activities such as singing and
literary societies. Although Negro pupils do not share in the purely social
activities, they do not organize such activities among themselves.
</p>

<p>
"The colored never come to social affairs," said the dean of one school.
"They are so much in the minority here that they leave all organizations to
the whites." The principal of this school told of having seen two colored girls
at a class party who danced together for a while and left. "It is the only
time I've seen the two races at the same social gathering."
</p>

<p>
The dean of Englewood said: "We have colored children in singing clubs,
in the orchestra, in literary societies, in class organizations, and on athletic
teams. Always when there is a class party there will be five or six colored
children. They will always dance together, but they are present and welcomed
by the white. Between dances it is not uncommon to see white and colored
talking."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
</p>

<p>
An incident showing lack of feeling against individuals of special achievement
was given by the principal of this last school:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Several years ago we organized a voluntary orchestra which met after school. The
director accepted all applications, among them a number of colored boys. The white
boys balked; it should be white membership or they would leave. As it was near
the end of the year the orchestra was dissolved. The next year I suggested to the
teacher that he fill the orchestra places by a general tryout, so understood, but really
with the policy of excluding the colored. This was done and a white orchestra
organized. Shortly, the father of H. F., a colored boy who had been excluded, protested
in my office, saying that his boy had been excluded because of race prejudice
and that he was going to carry his protest to the Board of Education, for he
knew his boy played better than any boy in school. I admitted that it was a
choice in the school of white orchestra or no orchestra, but that if his boy was the
fine musician he said he was I would gladly see what could be done. Soon after that
H. appeared on a school program and played with remarkable skill and technique.
He was applauded enthusiastically and recalled three times. Straightway the
orchestra members asked him to play with them. He became unusually popular
throughout the school. His standing was the highest and he was awarded a scholarship
of $100 allowed by the Board of Education for the best student. He was also
chosen to represent the school on the Northwestern University scholarship, and in
his Freshman year he won another scholarship for the next year. The death of his
parents made it necessary for him to leave college to support his brothers and sisters.
At this time he was stricken with infantile paralysis. The interest on Liberty bonds
taken out by the high school is paid in to H., and when the colored people gave a
benefit for him the pupils sold 500 tickets. He is improving and teaching violin to
thirty pupils at present. His sister is in the school now on a scholarship and is
doing remarkably well also.
</p>
</div>

<p>
At Wendell Phillips the situation was quite different, for there were no school
or class social affairs which were general. There were invitational affairs
to which the Negroes were not invited. All the clubs in the school were white,
Negroes being excluded. The principal said he would not insist on mixed
clubs until he saw the parents of the children mixing socially. The glee club
was an especially difficult problem because of its semi-public as well as social
character. The Negro children maintained that a glee club composed entirely
of whites was not representative of a school in which the majority were Negroes.
The Negroes had not responded to the suggestion of the principal that they
form a glee club of their own, and as the white children would not be in a glee
club with Negro children, there was constant friction over this club.
</p>

<p>
Other principals expressed the conviction that the racial problem of school
social affairs could not be solved until the prejudice and antagonism of adults
had disappeared. One principal said he had had to call off an arrangement
for a class affair because the hotel would not accommodate the Negroes.
Another principal thought that the schools would not wait to follow the lead
of the parents in forgetting the race prejudice but would themselves be the
greatest factor in destroying it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Relations with parents.</i>â€”In most cases the high schools were receiving
splendid support from Negro parents in matters of discipline. "I have never
had a case where the parent did not back up the teacher in the treatment
given to a colored child," said one principal, speaking of cases where children
had got into difficulty when they complained that the teacher had "picked on
them" because they were Negroes. The parents always made the child withdraw
the statement and admit that the trouble was not due to color at all.
</p>

<h5>
3. TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOLS
</h5>

<p>
Reports were received from three technical high schools, Lane, Tilden,
and Lucy H. Flower. Lane and Tilden had few Negro students, while in
Lucy H. Flower the Negroes were about 20 per cent. The principals of Lane
and Tilden said they were not conscious of any racial difference in their pupils,
that no special methods of instruction were necessary for the Negro children,
that there were no quarrels with a racial background in the schools, and no
voluntary or compulsory groupings of white and Negro. The principal of
Lucy H. Flower found racial differences between the Negroes and whites
which she believed created special problems of education and discipline.
The children got along together very well in school, and whatever quarrels
there were, the principal thought were due to personal dislikes rather than to
race prejudice. The colored girls grouped themselves voluntarily at noon and
at dismissal time, and the white girls did the same.
</p>

<h4>
III. RETARDATION
</h4>

<h5>
1. RETARDATION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS
</h5>

<p>
With the assistance of the Board of Education a selection was made of
three groups of schools to be studied for comparative retardation. The group
comprised six schools having the largest percentage of Negro children, six attended
mainly by whites in neighborhoods where the family income might be
comparable, and twelve attended mainly by children of immigrants. Table XII
gives the number and percentage of accelerated, normal, and retarded children
for each school, for each group, and for the whole group of twenty-four schools.
</p>

<p>
This table shows the much greater amount of retardation among schools
attended by Negroes than in schools attended by white Americans or by
children of immigrants. The percentage for the group attended by Negroes
is 74, while for the different schools in the group it varies from 67 to 81. For
the two groups of schools attended by white Americans the percentage of
retardation is the same, 49, though there is greater variation among these
schools than among the schools attended by Negroes. In the group attended
by children of immigrants, for instance, only 32 per cent are retarded in the
Jungman (Bohemian) School, while 71 per cent are retarded in the Holden
(Polish) School. A similar discrepancy appears in the group attended by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
white Americans, where the figure is 40 per cent for the Armstrong School
and 62 per cent for the Byford School.

<p>
The retardation figures for the group of twenty-four schools studied are
close to those for the city at large, 53 per cent retarded in the special group
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
and 51 per cent for the city at large. In the accelerated group the percentage
of accelerated Negro children, 11, is smaller than the percentage of accelerated
white children, 17, or the percentage of accelerated foreign children, 19. This
variation is not so striking as that in the normal group where only 15 per cent
of the Negro children appear to make normal progress as compared with 34
per cent of the white children and 32 per cent of the foreign children. From
this it would appear that there are factors in the lives of many Negro children
which prevent them from making normal progress.
</p>

<p>
The degree of retardation, as shown in Table XIII is again quite different
for the white and Negro groups.
</p>

<p>
The largest single groups of backward white American and foreign children
are retarded less than one year (42 per cent of the white American and 39
per cent of the foreign group), and the numbers decrease rapidly as the degree
of retardation increases. In the case of the Negroes 19 per cent are retarded
less than one year. The decrease as the degree of retardation increases is
slower than in the white groups, and many more children are retarded two,
three, four, five years and more. In the white American group only one child
out of 3,439 retarded children is retarded five and one-half to six years, while
there are forty-one in the corresponding Negro group out of a total of 4,412.
One white child is retarded six and one-half to seven years, while seventeen
Negro children are retarded this amount; twelve foreign children out of
10,379 retarded children are retarded six to ten years, and thirty-seven
Negro children are found in these groups.
</p>

<p>
Though the main reasons for the high degree of retardation among Negro
children are set forth in the next section under "Causes of Retardation,"
a partial explanation is to be found in the fact that Negro parents are frequently
more interested in keeping their over-age children in school than white parents,
especially foreign parents, whose anxiety to have their children leave school
as soon as they are old enough to get work-permits is well known.
</p>

<p>
<i>Causes of retardation.</i>â€”It is generally understood of course that comparisons
of Negro with white children are hardly fair, since Negro children have not
had the same opportunities as whites to make normal progress.
</p>

<p>
A study was made of the reasons why children were retarded in the groups
of schools attended mainly by Negroes, by white Americans, and by children
of immigrants. Records were obtained at the schools for 1,469 Negro children
and 1,560 white children who were listed according to the Board of Education's
classification for retarded children.
</p>

<p>
Table XIV shows clearly that the predominating cause of retardation among
Negroes is late entrance, which, according to the board's classification, means
that they did not enter school until more than six years of age. This is
generally explained by the fact that the family came from the South, where
there was no school near enough for the child to attend, or the school was
overcrowded, or the family was uneducated and indifferent. In some cases
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'></a></span>
the parents have come North, leaving the child with grandparents who made
no effort to see that it went to school.

<p>
The next most important cause of retardation among the Negroes is family
difficulties. The fathers are often kept away from home weeks at a time by
their work. A large number of the mothers are working, and the parents'
lack of education is frequently the cause of a home life that is below standard,
physically and morally.
</p>

<p>
Among the whites, late entrance, inability to speak the language, ill
health, backwardness, and low mentality are the main causes of retardation.
While it is often maintained that the Negro is the mental inferior of the white,
these figures do not bear out that contention. Also the retardation figures
do not show the home life of the Negroes to be productive of as much ill health
as is the case with the whites.
</p>

<p>
Approximately the same number of Negro and white children were retarded
because of irregular attendance.
</p>

<p>
In addition there were forty-two Negro children and 155 white children
who were classified under two, three, or four different causes for retardation.
Children who were late entering also had some physical difficulty, or children
who were retarded because of family difficulties were also of poor mental
endowment. In some cases such double classification represented a realization
by the teacher that retardation is a complicated and delicate thing which cannot
be explained by one hard-and-fast reason. Others, finding it difficult to
decide whether children were backward, of low mentality, or feeble-minded,
classified them under all three causes. In two instances Negroes were found
to be retarded because they were late entering and "foreign"â€”that is, they
were handicapped by an "initial lack of the English language."
</p>

<p>
<i>Intensive study of 116 retarded Negro children.</i>â€”The presence of retarded
Negro children in the Chicago public schools within recent years has been
regarded by many teachers and principals as a problem of Negro education.
Some assume that this retardation is due to an inherent incapacity for normal
grade work. Inquiries of the Commission early disclosed the fact that although
the retardation rate of Negro children was higher than that of white, the great
majority of the retarded Negroes were from southern states, and that Negro
children born in the North had, as a rule, no higher rate of retardation than
the whites. In the belief that the causes of retardation among Negro children
could be found in the same factors of social background and environment
which operates to retard white children, an intensive study was made of 116
Negro children taken at random from among all the retarded Negro children
in several schools to learn what elements in their former life and present
home environment might explain their retardation.
</p>

<p>
Out of the 116 children 101 had been in school before coming to Chicago.
Of these eighty-six had lived in the South and attended southern schools.
Since this group was chosen at random, the large proportion from the South
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
tends to bear out the statements of school principals and teachers that Negro
children from the South constitute the bulk of retarded children. Previous
school records were obtained for eighty-four of these eighty-six southern
children, and in sixty-four cases the children were retarded when they came
to Chicago. Many of them were retarded two and three years, and some
three, four, five, and even six years. Forty-seven of the sixty-four were
retarded more than one year. In a number of cases children who were in the
normal grade for their age in the South were put back one or two grades when
they entered Chicago schools because they were not equipped to do the work
of this grade in the North.
</p>

<p>
The states from which these children came are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Twenty-three of the eighty-six children who
had lived in the South were from Mississippiâ€”the largest group from any one
stateâ€”and of these three were up with their normal grade, eleven were retarded
three or four years, one was retarded six years, and one who was in the normal
grade in the South was demoted two years. One reason for the poor record
of these Mississippi children is undoubtedly to be found in that state's
inadequate compulsory-education law which provides a school term of eighty
days in districts which do not reject the law. Eight of the Mississippi children
lived on plantations which were so far from school that regular attendance
was impossible.
</p>

<p>
Information gathered concerning the parents of these 116 retarded children
showed that in eighty-six cases the father was living with his family. In
six cases the father was dead, in one case he was insane, in fifteen cases he had
separated from or deserted the mother, and in eight cases there was no report
on the father.
</p>

<p>
The mother was found to be living with her family in 112 cases. In two
cases the mother was dead, and in two cases she had deserted father and child.
</p>

<p>
All of the eighty-six fathers who lived at home were working, though one
was reported as working irregularly, and two as having deserted their wives
occasionally for periods of several weeks. In two of the cases where the father
had separated from the mother he was reported as contributing to the support
of the child.
</p>

<p>
In forty out of the eighty-six cases where the father was living at home and
working, the mother was also working, and in the fifteen separation cases
where the mother was supporting the child, she was working. The fact that
a total of fifty-five out of 112 mothers, or 49 per cent, were working is undoubtedly
a large factor in the retardation of the children. The statement was
frequently made by teachers that 40 or 50 per cent of the Negro mothers
worked, and that the child was therefore neglected, and the teacher could
get no co-operation from the mother, as she was never free to come to school
to talk over matters affecting the child.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Some teachers felt that many mothers worked where there was no economic
necessity, as the father was earning enough to support the family. It should
be noted in this connection that at the time this material was gathered there
were more opportunities for work than there were men to fill them. Under
ordinary conditions there would doubtless be a certain amount of unemployment
in these Negro families which would cause more mothers to work from
economic necessity. Many of the families investigated, where both parents
were working, were reported as getting on very well, though there were some
cases of real poverty. In a number of instances the families could not seem
to make ends meet on a good income because they were ignorant and did not
know how to spend their money, or because they had not been able to adjust
themselves to city life.
</p>

<p>
Of the eighty-six fathers who were working, few were in skilled occupations
which would command a substantial wage. Most of the mothers were engaged
in work that took them away from home. A few did sewing, hairdressing,
and laundry work in their homes, but the large majority went out to work.
Work carried on in the home frequently has as bad an effect on the child's
school attendance as the mother's absence, for the child is sometimes kept at
home to help and often finds the work more interesting than school.

<p>
<i>Education of parents.</i>â€”Of the eighty-six fathers, thirty-one were illiterate,
and forty-eight had gone to elementary school but had completed only the
second, fourth, or sixth grade. Five of the fathers had gone to high school,
and two were college graduates.
</p>

<p>
The figures are slightly better for the mothers. Out of 112, twenty-one
were totally illiterate, seventy-six had gone to elementary school, ten had been
in high school or college, and five were not reported on. Eighty-eight per cent
of the mothers, therefore, and 91 per cent of the fathers had less than a high-school
education. Though there were many illiterate or poorly educated
parents who were eager for their children to have advantages which they
never had themselves, others, as in any illiterate group, no matter what the
color, failed to appreciate the importance of school.

<i>Home discipline.</i>â€”A number of teachers reported that they were unable
to discipline the children in school because they were undisciplined at home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
In seventy-three of the 116 homes there was found to be discipline, in twenty-two
a lack of discipline, and twenty were not reported on. Discipline seemed
to be the responsibility of the mother in the large majority of cases, and many
of the twenty-two undisciplined children were boys who were beyond the
control of the mother. In every case but four where there was no discipline
the mother was working, so that the child did not receive much care during
the daytime and the mother was too tired to bother about discipline at night.
Lack of discipline can also be traced to the fact that the child has not always
lived with the parents but with relatives who have been lax in the matter of
discipline.
</p>

<p>
<i>Home care.</i>â€”The physical condition of the home, the preparation and
substance of the meals, may be expected to affect a child's health and therefore
his attendance at school. The homes of eighty-four children were reported
to be clean and twenty-five not clean, while seven were not reported on. In
twenty-one cases out of the twenty-five reported not clean, the mother was
working. In forty-seven cases out of the eighty-four reported clean the mother
was working. In many of the forty-seven cases there was an aunt or grandmother
who took care of the house.
</p>

<p>
In many homes the ignorance of the parents was obviously responsible
for failure to provide the kind of food adapted to the needs of the children.
A great deal of fresh meat, usually pork and bacon, potatoes, rice, and coffee
were the staples, while green vegetable, fruits, cereals, and milk were noticeably
lacking. Also, when the mother is away all day the food is hastily prepared,
which usually means that it is fried. The girl who gets home from school before
her mother has finished her day's work usually starts the dinner, or brings something
from the delicatessen. Many children are given twenty-five cents with
which to buy lunch, and in three extreme cases the children were given money
to buy all their meals, with no supervision over what they ate.
</p>

<p>
<i>Difficulty of adjustment.</i>â€”When all the causes contributing to retardation
were taken into consideration in the histories of the 116 retarded children
studied, it was still obvious that the greatest stumbling-block to normal progress
was previous residence in the South. The retardation of children from
the South is explained in a variety of ways.
</p>

<p>
Some of the children from the South did not get along well because they
had not been able to adjust themselves to city life. They had been accustomed
to the freedom and outdoor life of the farm and did not like the
confined life of the city. They felt timid and shy in the midst of so many
people, as they did not come much in contact with people when they lived
on southern farms four or five miles from the nearest town. Most of these
children had never gone to school for more than a few months at a time, either
because the school term was short or they lived too far from the school to
attend regularly. Consequently some of them found the nine months' term
irksome.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Demotion.</i>â€”A number of children were found to be over-aged for their
grades because they had been demoted one or two years when they came to
Chicago. Some of these had gone to school regularly in the South and
were of normal age for their grades, but the school term was so short that
it was impossible for them to complete the same amount of work in the
same number of years as children in northern schools. Children who were
in the fifth or fourth grade in the South had been put back to the third or second
grade on entering Chicago schools. This sometimes discouraged them so
much that they dropped out of school on reaching fourteen, the age limit of the
compulsory-education law.
</p>

<p>
<i>Inadequate schools.</i>â€”Overcrowded and poorly taught schools also are
responsible for the retardation of southern Negro children. One girl attended
a school which was in session only three months a year and where there were
100 to 125 children under one teacher. Consequently this girl was retarded
four years. A boy who, when he came to Chicago, was fifteen years old and
six years behind his grade had always lived in small country towns in the South.
In one of these his teacher was the iceman. "He didn't come to school until
he was through totin' ice around," said the boy. "Then if anyone wanted
ice they comed after him. He wasn't learning me anything so I quit." This
boy was found to be ambitious and was attending school regularly in Chicago
in spite of the fact that he was conspicuously over-age for his grade.
</p>

<p>
<i>Other causes of retardation.</i>â€”Some over-age children are extremely sensitive
about their size and are irregular at school on this account. A fifteen-year-old
boy who was 5 feet 8 inches tall was in the fifth grade. He refused to go to
school because he was larger than anyone in his class. At one time he was so
ashamed of being seen in the room with smaller children that he would go out
of the classroom every time a girl passed the door.
</p>

<p>
As in many white families where the importance of regular school attendance
is not fully understood, work at home or work after school hours is sometimes
permitted to interfere materially with school attendance. Older children
are kept at home to look after young children while the parents are away at
work and sometimes when the mother is home. A fourteen-year-old girl who
was three years retarded had always been kept out of school to do housework.
The five younger children were all in the normal grades for their ages but the
fourteen-year-old girl had been out of school so much she had lost interest.
Other children were working after school hours selling papers and delivering
packages and wanted to leave school as soon as possible so that they could
work all the time.
</p>

<p>
The attitude of the teacher seemed in a few instances to be responsible
for the child's lack of interest. In one case the teacher threw a paper at a
boy instead of handing it to him, and the boy had refused to recite to her
ever since. He went to school but recited to his mother at home. Another
boy had been kept back in school by a misunderstanding between his mother
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
and the principal. The principal took the boy home with her to do some work
around her house and kept him until nine o'clock. The mother became so
worried she had the police out looking for him. When she found out the cause
of his lateness coming home, she went to the school and threatened the principal.
The principal afterward refused either to promote the boy or transfer him to
another school.
</p>

<p>
<i>Recreation.</i>â€”A study of the favorite forms of recreation among 116 children,
aside from the few who reported that they had no time to play, showed the
movies to be in the lead. Children economized on lunch, buying potato salad
and pickles, in order to have enough left from their lunch money to go to the
movies. One boy who worked outside of school hours made $3 to $5 a week
and spent most of it on the movies; he went three or four times a day if he had
the money. A few children played truant in order to go to the movies.

<p>
Most of these children had two and even three forms of recreation, and the
second was usually some form of outdoor recreationâ€”baseball, marbles, or
jumping rope. Most of the younger ones went to the playgrounds, except
those who had housework to do or the few who did not care to associate with
other children.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A reference to the section on "Recreation" will show that Negro children
are limited in their recreational activities by lack of recreation centers where
they are welcome. There are playgrounds for the younger children in the
areas of Negro residence, but no recreation centers with their varied indoor
facilities for the older children.
</p>

<h5>
2. OPINIONS ON SCHOLARSHIP OF NEGRO CHILDREN
</h5>

<p>
<i>Progress of the southern Negro.</i>â€”The retarded Negro child, usually from
the South, who is conspicuous in the elementary schools, has been referred to
in the section on "Retardation in Elementary Schools." In some schools
such children are put in the regular grades, where they receive no special
attention and can progress only one year at a time, though most teachers agree
that retardation is due to lack of educational opportunity rather than to
inability to learn. In other schools there are special rooms for these children
where they are advanced through several grades as rapidly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Doolittle School (85 per cent) had six first-grade rooms for such children.
In one of these rooms there were about twenty-five children from twelve to
seventeen years of age doing all the lower-grade work up to the sixth. The
teacher said that many of these children who were unable to read or write
when they came from the South showed remarkable progress in a few months,
and in less than a year were able to do fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade work.
</p>

<p>
"One big girl of thirteen, when she arrived from the South," this teacher
said, "pretended to read with her book upside down, but in a little more than
a year she was doing sixth-grade work. One twelve-year-old boy from the
South, unable to read the primer or write his name, after about nine months
of applied work just ate up everything I gave him and during the following
year read sixty library books."
</p>

<p>
A thirteen-year-old girl, just five days in the school, had come from
Alabama, where she had never attended school. "There wasn't room for me,"
she explained. She read for the investigator on the tenth page of the primer,
haltingly but with understanding. The teacher was confident that she
could put her through several grades next year. She said further:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
These children who have been deprived in the South of their rights educationally
are very eager. At first they are timid, but they learn very quickly. They're as
smart as whips if they'd just get down to business. Without question this is the kind
of attention all the colored children from the South need when they enter school in
the North. The plan has been successful and should be adopted throughout the school
system. One appreciates by comparison the injustice of putting the fifteen-year-old
newcomer from the South into second grade, requiring of him only second-grade
work over the nine months' period.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another school, 92 per cent Negro (Farren), has a special room for children
from the South. "Our dull children are almost without exception those
from the South who have never been to school," said the teacher. "Those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
children should not be classed as dull, either, for they learn remarkably fast
and often catch up to grade."
</p>

<p>
A teacher of the ungraded room in a school 38 per cent Negro (Forrestville)
said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Practically all of the colored children are from the South, where they have not
been in school. Once they get started they learn very rapidly and often catch up
to the proper grade if they are not too old when they start school. The older children
in this room have good power of concentration and consequently learn much in a short
time. Take, for example, a boy twelve years old who came here not two months ago
from the South. When he came he had no idea how to write his name. A few days
ago he wrote for me a fourth-grade eight-line memory passage with but three mistakes
in spelling. Now I call that remarkable. I have taught in this school all my teaching
years, and they have been many, and have never seen any child equal this, either
white or black.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Capacity for advanced work.</i>â€”Teachers in the seventh and eighth grades
usually found Negro children equal to the work, though in some cases they
felt that these children had been pushed out of the lower grade because of
crowded conditions before they were ready for the more advanced work.
An eighth-grade teacher gave the following statement:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
When children get this far they have a good foundation and do their work very
well. One of my colored girls is the brightest child in schoolâ€”arithmetic is hard for
her but she works at it. One of my colored boys is seventeen years old. He came
here from the South last fall to live with an uncle and to get to a better school. His
father wants him to be a doctor and thought he wasn't getting along as well in the
South as he would in the North. When the boy came to me he said he had been going
to a college<a name='FA_40' id='FA_40' href='#FN_40' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a> in the South. I took him into the eighth grade but saw he didn't have
the fundamentals. On close questioning he told me he had been in the seventh
grade in that college. Now he is doing excellent work for me. He has much broader
interests than the other children. He reads, reads, reads, all the time and is well
informed.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Other teachers believed that there was nothing to keep the Negro children
from making equal progress with the white, given similar opportunities.
"The progress of the colored children in Drake school (30 per cent) cannot
be compared with that of the white," said an upper-grade teacher, "because
the colored are all from the South and have had the poorest opportunities.
But comparing a Negro child and a white child who have had the same advantages
in school and equal opportunities for observation and example in the
home, the Negro makes the same progress."
</p>

<p>
"I say that under the same conditions a Negro child will do as well every
time as a white," said the teacher of an ungraded room in a school 38 per cent
Negro (Forrestville). "Many do as well as the white and live in very poor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269' href='#Page_269'>269</a></span>
neglected homes. I think every person who is not prejudiced must admit that
the colored do fully as well in school as the white."
</p>

<p>
An upper-grade teacher in the Felsenthal School (20 per cent) held a
similar point of view: "The colored are making wonderful strides. They
advance just as rapidly as the white, given equal opportunities. But their
background is so slight and so short in years that one cannot fairly compare
them. The southern colored child must be studied individually to get his point
of view in the school or he gets nowhere in his work."
</p>

<p>
<i>High-school work.</i>â€”The principal of Wendell Phillips High School prepared
tables showing the numbers of white and Negro children dropping out at the
end of each school year. They show that the largest number of Negro children
dropped out during the first year, and the largest number of white children
during the first and second years, the number of drop-outs being the same
for both years. Some children repeat the work so that all of them do not
leave school.
</p>

<p>
One or two teachers in other schools stated concerning Negro children
that a "very limited number go beyond the first year." "They cannot grasp
the subject," said an English teacher; "they do not understand as the white
child does. They lack the mentality."
</p>

<p>
In the same school the Latin teacher held quite the opposite opinion.
"The colored children are in every way equal to the white children. They are
just as well equipped mentally and make similar progress. My best student
at present is a colored girl. Her choice of English and her vocabulary and
construction are far ahead of that of any white student."
</p>

<p>
Several teachers and principals testified to the brilliancy of individual
Negro students who not infrequently had the highest standing in the school.
The principal of an elementary school (Crerar) who had formerly had experience
in a school largely Negro felt that the junior high school would meet the needs
of the Negro children to a large degree:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
More of them than the immigrant enter high school but do not stay to finish.
I suppose the parents insist upon some high-school training, but it is necessary
for the child to go to work before he finishes. Another reason for the dropping out
might be the teachers' lack of interest in the child. In the high school you don't
find the teachers taking a keen interest in every individual child as you do in the grades,
and just what colored children need is a keen interest in them. They do better work.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Academic v. other courses.</i>â€”A preference of Negro children for academic
work was reported by principals and teachers at two high schools. This may
be due in part to the fact, testified to by many teachers, that Negro children
excel in languages and music and find mathematics and sciences difficult.
The usual implication was, however, that Negro children took academic work
because they thought it gave them better social standing. A principal who
said that "Negroes want to know nothing about industrial training" and
that "the girls don't care for sewing and cooking," said on another occasion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
that the majority of children in auto-mechanics, printing, and household arts
were Negroes. He also reported more Negro than white children in the normal
course preparing themselves to be teachers, though this was the first year
that this had been the case.
</p>

<p>
<i>Comparative scholarship in elementary schools.</i>â€”Negro children are reported
to be slower than the Jews, less responsive than the Bohemians, and more
ambitious than the Italians. A manual-training and domestic-arts teacher
thought Negroes did as good work as the Jews, Bohemians, and white Americans
whom he taught. A Latin teacher said that the Negroes were studious and
ambitious, and that in every way she preferred them to the Jews.
</p>

<p>
Several teachers thought the Negroes were slow and lacked logic and
"sticking qualities." An upper-grade teacher explained the slowness as
partly due to the fact that they had been pushed out of the crowded lower
grades before they were ready for more advanced work. A physics teacher
who was convinced that Negro children had no ambition said it was his
policy to promote a Negro child if the child had made the effort, because he
appreciated that the child had come "to the limit of his mental ability."
</p>

<p>
The principal who said that Negroes had no "sticking qualities" gave
a single instance of a boy who wanted to become a mechanical engineer but
gave up the course after five months, because he said he did not care enough
about the course to work at it for several years. In endeavoring to prove
that Negro children are not successful in completing high-school work, this
principal emphasized the fact that in the 3-B class 20 per cent of the Negroes
dropped out as compared with 6 per cent of the whites. In actual numbers
three Negroes and two whites dropped out. He did not mention that in the
2-A class 12 per cent of the whites (sixteen children) as compared with 3 per
cent of the Negroes (three children) dropped out. In the 4-B grade 21 per
cent of the whites (three children) and none of the Negroes dropped out.
The fact that 21 per cent of the whites dropped out was explained by the
principal to be due to the fact that the white children wished to graduate
from a high school wholly white. However, only three children were involved.
</p>

<p>
<i>Attendance and failures.</i>â€”Table XVI shows the record for attendance and
failures in three groups of schools attended mainly by Negroes, by children
of immigrants and by white Americans. It will be noticed that the best
attendance records are found in Douglas and Farren schools, both mainly
attended by Negroes. The other schools, attended mainly by Negroes,
compare favorably with those attended by whites.
</p>

<p>
The smallest percentage of failures is at Colman (92 per cent), while the
next to the largest percentage is also at a school attended mainly by Negroes
(Raymond, 93 per cent). This may be explained to a certain extent by the
fact that there is a higher economic class of Negroes in the neighborhood of
the Colman School. In the other schools the percentage of failures compares
very favorably with that of whites.

C. CONTACTS IN RECREATION
</h3>

<p>
In studying contacts between the races at places of recreation a survey
was made of the various recreational facilities maintained by the Municipal
Bureau of Parks, Playgrounds, and Bathing Beaches, the South Park Commission,
the West Chicago Park Commission, and the Lincoln Park Commission.
Recreational facilities maintained by twelve park boards which control smaller
areas in outlying parts of the city were not included in the survey unless they
were in or near Negro areas. Visits were made by the Commission's investigator
to places in or bordering on the Negro areas at a time of day when the
use of the park would be greatest; the director or one of his assistants was
interviewed and observations were made as to the relations between Negroes
and whites.
</p>

<p>
The information thus gathered was supplemented by a conference held
by the Commission, at which representatives of the various park boards
discussed policies and experiences with reference to race relations in the various
recreation places under their charge.
</p>

<h4>
I. CLASSIFICATION OF FACILITIES
</h4>

<p>
Although there is no definite city-wide classification, the publicly maintained
recreation facilities of the city may, for the purpose of this study, be
grouped by types and defined as follows:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. <i>Playground.</i>â€”A small tract of land, usually adjacent to public schools,
providing space for ball games, gymnastic and play apparatus, and in most
cases a small building used as an office and storage place for apparatus.
</p>

<p>
2. <i>Recreation center.</i>â€”Including outdoor and indoor gymnasiums for men,
women, and children, a swimming-pool, and a little children's playground
out doors, and a field house providing an assembly room and dance hall, clubrooms,
shower baths, and often an infant-welfare station and branch library.
</p>

<p>
3. <i>Large park.</i>â€”A large area with lawns, shrubbery, and general recreation
facilities, such as tennis, golf, baseball, and boating.
</p>

<p>
4. <i>Bathing-beach.</i>â€”Intended primarily for swimmers and usually including
no other recreation equipment. A dressing-house, showers, and towel supply
are provided with life guard and attendants on duty.
</p>

<p>
5. <i>Swimming-pool.</i>â€”In some instances a swimming-pool or natatorium
is maintained separately from a recreation center.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
II. DISTRIBUTION OF FACILITIES IN RELATION TO NEGRO AREAS
</h4>

<p>
Of a total of 127 public places of recreation excluding the large parks,
thirty-seven are in or near Negro areas. Of the eighty-two playgrounds,
fourteen are in the Negro areas and nine are adjacent. Of the twenty-nine
recreation centers, none is located within the Negro areas, but seven are
adjacent.
</p>

<p>
Though these figures seem to indicate that the Negro areas are fairly
well supplied with recreation facilities, it should be borne in mind that their
use by the Negroes in their vicinity is by no means free and undisputed. The
reasons for this are shown in the next section on "Use of Facilities," but the
following summary of use will aid in considering the distribution of recreation
facilities in relation to the Negro areas:

<p>
The type of recreation facility most commonly found in the Negro areas
is the playground. The lack of recreation centers within the Negro areas is
conspicuous, as is also the fact that six of the seven recreation centers accessible
to Negroes are not used as much as 10 per cent by them. The playground is
intended for the use of young children and has practically nothing to attract
older children and adults, except sometimes a baseball or athletic field. Indoor
facilities are not a part of the equipment of a playground, so that the average
maintenance cost of a playground is not more than $2,000 to $5,000 a year.<a name='FA_41' id='FA_41' href='#FN_41' class='fnanchor'>[41]</a>

<p>
The recreation center is the most unusual and notable feature of Chicago's
recreation system but one from which the Negro gets little benefit. It is a
complete community center, with both indoor and outdoor facilities. It
represents an investment of from $200,000 to $800,000, according to the
amount of ground, the location, and the extent of its facilities. The yearly
expenditure necessary to maintain such a recreation center where older children
and adults can hold meetings, dances, and entertainments, and where there
are concerts, indoor games, swimming-pools, showers, etc., is shown by the
reports of the park boards to be from $30,000 to $50,000. Though the argument
that wholesome recreation makes for better citizenship applies to Negroes
as well as to whites, no recreation center has been located within the Negro
areas and only seven near them.<a name='FA_42' id='FA_42' href='#FN_42' class='fnanchor'>[42]</a>
</p>

<p>
The director of Armour Square, a recreation center which is just beyond
the edge of the main Negro area, but which the Negroes do not feel free to
use for reasons discussed later, was asked what places of recreation for adult
Negroes existed in that neighborhood. She instanced a social settlement
that had been out of existence for more than six years, an infant-welfare station
and a commercial amusement park known to be in bad repute.
</p>

<p>
Although in recent years the Negro population has been increasing in
density in the neighborhood directly east of Wentworth Avenue along which
Hardin, Armour, and Fuller recreation centers are located, this has not increased
the use of these centers by Negroes. It has tended, rather, to increase the
antagonism of the whites in the vicinity to the use of the centers by Negroes.
In this neighborhood the hostility toward Negroes of whites, especially gangs
of hoodlums, is shown by the many attacks upon Negroes in this area as discussed
in the sections on the "Riot of 1919" and "Antecedent Clashes."
</p>

<p>
Several representatives of the park boards strongly deprecated the lack
of recreation centers within the Negro area and said that such facilities should
be provided. The South Park representative recommended the area east of
Wentworth Avenue between Thirtieth and Forty-seventh streets as one
needing additional facilities. The West Park representative said: "A complete
all-year-round recreation center for the colored people should be established
at Ashland and Lake streets. We need greater facilities, or equal facilities,
for the colored people. There isn't any place on the West Side that I know of,
but yet we have many of these complete recreation centers there for the whites."
Although the Negroes on the West Side had never asked for additional facilities,
the white people in that neighborhood had frequently asked the West Park
Commission to provide greater facilities for the Negroes. The Negroes in
the district were not organized, according to the West Park official, but the
white people realized that something ought to be done for the Negroes and
made the request.
</p>

<p>
The director of Seward Park said the maintenance cost was the chief
obstacle to additional recreational facilities. "The law permits acquisition
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
of property for small parks by request of citizens and bond issues for the
purchase of the property and its development," he said. "When it comes to
maintenance the question of taxes comes in, and unless people are willing to be
taxed in excess of what they are taxed now, there won't be any possibility
of maintaining more parks."
</p>

<p>
Though there are three public bathing-beaches near the main Negro area,
the whites seem to expect Negroes to confine themselves to the Twenty-sixth
Street Beach. It is quite limited and unattractive in approach and surroundings.
The approach is over a rough road through a much-neglected neighborhood,
and then up a long flight of stairs to a four-foot viaduct over the railroad
tracks, and a roundhouse and switch yards are near by. The beach is a strip
of sand about fifty feet wide and a short block in length; it narrows at one
end to the tracks and at the other end is walled by a high embankment.
While it offers a chance to get into the lake, the atmosphere of wholesome,
recreative outdoor life is entirely lacking.
</p>

<p>
In the Morgan Park region there is a large Negro population but no park
or playground within its Negro area. Barnard Playground and Ridge Park
are the nearest facilities, a mile or more distant. Negro children said they
did not go there because "those are in Beverley Hills and only rich folks go
thereâ€”no colored people." The directors of these parks said there was no
discrimination against Negroes but that they did not come because they felt
that these parks were "for white folks only."

<p>
<i>Factors influencing attendance.</i>â€”Out of the thirty-five playgrounds, recreation
centers, and bathing-beaches in or near the Negro areas for which attendance
figures were secured, at fifteen Negro attendance never amounted to
more than 10 per cent, and usually was less. In several cases distance or such
barriers as railroad tracks seemed to explain the small percentage of Negro
patrons. In other cases it seemed due to the existence of other facilities nearer
the center of the Negro area which were more largely patronized by the Negroes;
an example is Stanton, which though not far from the Negro area is farther
than Seward Park. The small number of Negroes at other places often could
not be explained by the director. At Gladstone Playground, for example, in a
neighborhood where the Negro population was increasing rapidly, practically
no Negro children were found, though the white children said there were
plenty of Negro children in the school. "They don't stick around after
school hours or in the summer," said the children, but no one appeared to
know why this was the case, as there had never been any difficulty at this
playground. Negro children used Drake and Sherwood playgrounds much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'></a></span>
less, or not at all, after school hours and in summer. At Drake, though the
two races mingled in games in the daytime and no disorders had occurred,
the Negro boys took no part in the games in the evening when the older white
boys were home. This, the director said, was due not to timidity or fear of
aggression, but rather to "lack of ambition." At Sherwood Playground,
west of Wentworth Avenue, where 50 per cent of the children using the playground
during school hours were Negroes, there were no Negroes on the
playground in the afternoon and evening and all summer. This was said
to be due to the fact that the Negro children in the school, especially the girls,
were larger than the white children and during the school session were the
dominating group. After school, however, the older white children got home
from other schools or from work and assumed control, allowing no Negroes in
the playground. The Negroes then went to Carter Playground, which is
east of Wentworth Avenue, in the main Negro settlement. This separation,
the attendant stated, was due entirely to action on the part of the children, as
the officials did not discriminate in any way. This neighborhood has been
much disturbed and is discussed in more detail under "Contacts."

</div>

<p>
Representatives of each park commission said that they had no rules
or regulations of any kind discriminating against Negroes, and that all races
were treated in exactly the same way. The only case in which this rule
appeared to be violated was in connection with Negro golf players at Jackson
Park. Two Negroes participated in the Amateur Golf Tournament at Jackson
Park in the summer of 1918 and made good records. The only requirement
for entrance into the tournament at that time was residence in the city for one
year. In 1919 the requirements were increased, entries being limited to the
lowest sixty-four scores, and membership in a "regularly organized golf club"
being required. Since Negroes are not accepted in established golf clubs, the
Negro golf players met this qualification by organizing a new club, "The
Windy City Golf Association." In 1920 the restriction was added that contestants
must belong to a regularly organized golf club affiliated with the Western
Golf Association. As it was impossible for Negro clubs to secure such affiliation,
it is impossible for Negroes to compete in the tournament.
</p>

<p>
Unofficial discrimination, however, frequently creeps in. According to the
representative of the Municipal Bureau, "the person in charge of the park is
largely influenced by the attitude of the people outside the park. We had
trouble at Beutner Playground because of the tendency on the part of the
director, who was a white man, to be influenced by the attitude of the white
people in the neighborhood, and either consciously or unconsciously showed by
his actions to the colored people that they were not fully accepted." Beutner
Playground later became an example of unofficial discrimination in favor of
the Negroes, for the Municipal Bureau decided to "turn over the playground
particularly to Negroes" and instructed the director "to give them more use of
the facilities than the whites." But this was found to be impossible as long as
a white director was employed, because he was influenced by the feeling of
the whites in the neighborhood who did not want the playground turned over
to the Negroes. The desired result was finally obtained by employing a
Negro director. "Then the switch suddenly came," said the park representative,
"and the playground was turned over to the Negroes almost exclusively."
</p>

<p>
A similar method was employed with reference to the Twenty-sixth Street
Beach, according to the head of the Municipal Bureau, who said: "As the
colored population gradually got heavier and more demand came for the use
of that beach it gradually developed into a beach that was used almost exclusively
by Negroes. And we did as we did in the Beutner case: we employed
a Negro director when the preponderance was Negro."
</p>

<p>
This beach has since been transferred to the South Park Commission,
and there is no longer a Negro director there, though most of the attendants
are Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Park policemen will not let Negroes go in swimming at the Thirty-eighth
Street Beach, according to a Negro playground director. "The park policemen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
tell you, 'You can't go in, you better not go in, I'd advise you not to go in,'"
said the director. "If you try to go in he keeps you out."
</p>

<p>
The Negro director of Beutner Playground reported an unpleasant personal
encounter with the policeman of Armour Square. "Last summer I had occasion
to go over there with my assistant who is colored. We went to the library
and the park police officer we met said, 'niggers ought to stay in Beutner
Park.'" Policemen in Armour Square also had helped to drive out Negro
boys who had gone over there to use the showers, according to this director.
In addition he said that Negro boys had been refused permits to play baseball
at Armour Square. The director of the park said, in answer to these statements,
that there was no discrimination on the part of the management and
if such things had occurred it was without the knowledge of the management
and due to the fact that the applicants did not see anyone in authority. "The
only applicants I have had for a colored baseball team this year was for an
outside industrial team, and they were given permission," said the director.
"Whether the police officer followed them up and told them they shouldn't
come back, I don't know, but they didn't come back. I gave them the permit
to come."
</p>

<p>
At one or two parks definite efforts had been made to encourage larger
numbers of Negroes to make use of the facilities, but at Armour Square the
director did not believe this to be advisable. "I have never gone out to do
any promotional work to bring them in," she said, "because I would not choose
personally to be responsible for the things that would happen outside my
gates if I were responsible for bringing large groups into Armour Square.
If such groups come to me for reservations I give them, but they don't come."
This director also said that she would feel it necessary to warn any Negro
group that might come to her park that she could not be responsible for their
protection outside the park.
</p>

<p>
At Union Park, which has a playground and swimming-pool and is situated
on the edge of the densest Negro residential area on the West Side, every effort
has been made to encourage the Negroes of the neighborhood to make use of
the limited facilities, according to the representative of the West Chicago
Park Commission, who said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have advertised among the colored people and done everything we could
to get them to use the swimming-pool, shower baths, and reading-room, and send their
children to the playground. The result to some extent is satisfactory but of course
they are not using it in proportion to the population of the Negroes in that neighborhood.
That, I think, is partly due to the fact that we ought to have some other
facilities there. We ought to have some equipment for boys over sixteen years of
age, and we ought to have an assembly hall, a regular library, clubrooms, and other
facilities for the recreation of older boys and girls.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The director of Fuller Park told of a special effort he had made, with the
assistance of a Y.M.C.A. physical instructor, a Negro, to increase the use of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
the park by Negroes living east of Wentworth Avenue. The Y.M.C.A.
instructor guaranteed to get the people, and 400 application blanks were
distributed among Negro children in the Sunday schools of the neighborhood.
All the blanks were signed with the names of Negro children between eight
and sixteen and returned to the office. When the classes started a few weeks
later, no Negro children appeared. The distributor of the blanks tried for
three or four weeks to find out why the Negro children did not come but
failed to discover any reason. Then the director sent a notice to the <i>Defender</i>,
a widely circulated Negro newspaper, saying that the children who had signed
application blanks for classes at Fuller Park were requested to come at any
time and were just as welcome as white children. Thereupon a few children
cameâ€”two or three out of a class of thirty. Additional notices were put
in the <i>Defender</i>, and an effort was made to interest the Negro pastors, but the
attendance did not increase, and finally the attempt was given up for that year.
The next year a similar effort was made but with only slightly better results.
At the band concerts and moving pictures the Negro attendance is fairly good,
and a large number of Negroes use the library, but the gymnasium and the
children's playground are used very little by the Negroes, and the swimming-pool
practically not at all.
</p>

<p>
The reasons advanced by the park officials for the non-use of convenient
recreation facilities are that the Negro is timid and reluctant to go where he
feels he is not wanted, or that he fears attack in the park or near it. At a
conference the West Park representative said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
When we first opened the doors of Union Park we thought, owing to the large
colored population in the district, that the colored people would come there most
willingly and avail themselves of the facilities just as freely as any person would.
But we found that it was not so, that the greater number of persons who came there
were the whites, and they as usual availed themselves of the facilities freely. The
colored were timid, came in gradually, and as soon as they found they were welcome,
that there was no line of discrimination drawn, the attendance of the colored increased.
</p>
</div>

<p>
At Sherwood Playground, Armour Square, and Fuller Square, all west of
Wentworth Avenue, which is considered the dividing line between the white
and Negro areas, fear is probably a large factor in the small Negro attendance,
as the feeling in the neighborhood is bitter and fights have been frequent.
At Sherwood Negro children use the playground during school hours when
they feel that they have the protection of the school, but not after school
when they feel that protection is lacking. Webster School at Wentworth
Avenue and Thirty-third Street, which is 30 per cent Negro, has its graduation
exercises in Armour Square, but the Negro children do not go to Armour Square
at any other time, and they did not go over at night for an entertainment which
the principal of Webster School arranged at Armour Square. Negro children use
the Armour Square library freely, according to the director, but there has
never been an application for the use of a clubroom, and no Negroes come to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
the outdoor moving pictures which are given one night a week. "There's
absolutely nothing to prevent them coming," said the director. "Why don't
they come? There is nothing within the park they need to be afraid of.
There has been absolutely no distinction made in the handling of colored
children or colored men or colored women coming to Armour Square, but
they do not come." The director was positive that the failure to come to
the park was due to the attitude toward Negroes outside the park. She
explained that although she could guarantee safety and police protection
inside the park, she could do nothing to protect Negroes outside the park
gates. The park policemen are employees of the park boards and not of the
city and have no jurisdiction outside the parks. This is true of the police at
all parks and beaches maintained by the park boards, but the police at the
playgrounds and beaches maintained by the Municipal Bureau of Parks,
Playgrounds, and Bathing Beaches are members of the regular city police
force.
</p>

<p>
Continuing, the Armour Square director said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Personally I know of no disturbances that have started within Armour Square,
and yet we have had outside of Armour Square every year at least two riots, not counting
the general race riotâ€”riots that started largely in school clashes. There have
been some very serious riots between the children of the Webster School and the
Keith School just east of it, and there have also been some very serious clashes between
the black and white children going to and from the parochial schoolâ€”actual fights in
which they have had to call large detachments of the police. Armour Square is
not used by the colored people in proportion to their numbers in the neighborhood,
but it has absolutely nothing to do with our management. It is because they are
afraid to come to the park. They know absolutely that within the four walls of the
park nothing is going to happen to them.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The testimony of the Negro director of the Beutner Playground seemed
to indicate that Negroes were kept out of Armour Square in ways that its
director did not know about.
</p>

<h4>
IV. CONTACTS
</h4>

<p>
<i>Behavior.</i>â€”The behavior of Negroes at the parks apparently has not been
the major cause of the difficulties that have arisen in the past. Such complaints
as were made by park officials in regard to the behavior of Negroes at the parks
concerned groups of rough or domineering children at the playgrounds rather
than adults.

<p>
The playgrounds where the attitude of Negro children was criticized
were Sherwood and Moseley, both in neighborhoods where unusually bitter
racial feeling was reported by the playground directors. The older Negro
girls were particularly rough and hard to control, these officials said, abusing
small children both white and Negro, monopolizing apparatus, and refusing
to leave the playground when asked to do so.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Testimony in regard to adults indicated that the park directors found
them quiet and desirable patrons of the parks. Said the director of Seward
Park:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
One of the most interesting and best-conducted and best-behaved groups I have
ever seen is a group of colored people known as the "Jolly Twenty," a dancing
organization. They started coming eight years ago and had a system of couple
dancing which was marvelous. I have never seen it equaled anywhere. They have
been coming every year, once a year, for a dance at Seward, and the "Jolly Twenty"
has grown to be about the "Jolly Four Hundred," but the larger the group the better
they seem to behave and the better they dance.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The director of Ogden Park told of a Negro club which holds frequent
dances at Ogden Park. He said: "About 300 attended the last one. They
are the best-behaved group that come. I never have to object to improper
dancing or boisterousness, and they always leave on time, have had to
object several times to conduct at white dancing parties."
</p>

<p>
This testimony in regard to Negroes at dances is interesting in view of
the situation regarding the recreation facilities at the Municipal Pier. Negro
attendance there is about 8 per cent of the total attendance of four million or
five million a year, according to the director of the Pier. They are well dressed
and well behaved and inclined to segregate themselves. There had never
been a single instance of an intoxicated Negro or of one who had made himself
in the least objectionable, the director said. The only people whom the pier
authorities have had to reprimand for violation of pier rules in regard to
cleanliness, monopolizing of furniture, etc., have been whites. Many of the
attendants are Negroes, and the band which plays for the dance concessionaire
is composed of Negroes. Negroes are welcome everywhere on the Pier, as
are all races, according to the director, except in the dance hall, where their
appearance is discouraged by the concessionaire. The following method is
followed to discourage the appearance of Negroes on the dance floor, according
to a white man who had observed it:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Admission to the dance floor is at the rate of five cents per couple, per dance.
Each dance lasts about three minutes. If a Negro couple buys a ticket and dances
one dance nothing is said. If the couple comes in for another dance, one of the
floor managersâ€”employed by the concessionaireâ€”speaks courteously to the couple.
He expresses regret that he must mention the matter of their dancing to them, but
that they are not dancing properly, and he invites them to come to a corner of
the dance floor where he will instruct them in the proper way to dance. This usually
occupies the remainder of the particular dance, and results in the Negroes not coming
on the floor again. If the couple does reappear, the floor manager again speaks to
them saying he is very sorry he has to tell them again that they still are not dancing
quite properly and again he invites them to a corner of the dance floor for further
instruction. This is the procedure by which the Negroes are embarrassed and discouraged
from using the dance floor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Relations between the children.</i>â€”Lack of antagonism was reported at a
large number of playgrounds. Apparatus was used by both groups without
friction, Negro and white children mingled freely in their games and in the
swimming-pools, and both Negroes and whites played on baseball and athletic
teams. Occasional playground fights had taken place, but usually without
any element of racial antipathy. "There might be personal misunderstandings
and disagreements between a white and a black just the same as between two
whites," said the director of Union Park, "but I wouldn't lay it to race prejudice.
They work together and play together and seem to harmonize in
most instances." When this director came to Union Park a year before he
found a tendency among Negroes and whites to group by themselves, but
steps were taken to bring them together in games of various kinds, and toward
the end of the season the director felt that they "harmonized better and worked
together more cordially than they did before." When the investigator from
the Commission visited Union Park Playground, he saw the small children
playing together on the same pieces of apparatusâ€”a Negro child on one end
of a teeter ladder and a white child on the other.
</p>

<p>
These children were ten years or under. The director felt that it was
not until children reached the age of eleven years or older that they began
to feel racial antipathy. In the swimming-pool at this park, which is used
by the older children and adults, the Negroes and whites kept separate. There
was no trouble between them, but they stayed in separate groups. The director
felt that there was little likelihood of trouble ever starting in this park, because
"where such nicknames as 'Smoke' are applied to colored boys by white boys,
and is given and accepted in a friendly spirit, there is little chance for serious
disturbance."
</p>

<p>
As this playground in Union Park is intended for children under ten, the
occasional difficulties between older children might be alleviated if the Hayes
Playground, one of those in the system maintained by the Municipal Bureau,
were kept open in the summer. The playground at the Hayes School, 80
per cent Negro, was closed and the apparatus dismantled in the summer of
1920 when the investigator visited it. Though it is not a large playground
it is the one the older Negro children are accustomed to use during the school
year, and they are doubtless reluctant to go in the summer to other school
playgrounds which they do not ordinarily use.
</p>

<p>
At Seward Park the Negroes use the facilities freely and play with the
white children on the apparatus and in the ball field. The only difficulty
reported here was in connection with a wrestling tournament. The director
described it as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Last season we had a wrestling championship tournament. There were some
colored groups who had wrestled at Seward who were eligible for entrance into this
tournament, and when the night came for weighing in, the director for one of the
other parks said, "What are these colored people doing here?" "They are weighing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
in." I said. "They will not wrestle with my group," he said. "Very well, then,
I guess your groups will not be in it," I said.
</p>

<p>
It looked as though we were up against a problem, but the night when the wrestling
came the colored contestants didn't show up, so that the problem was solved for that
time. Of course we couldn't say that any white man must wrestle with a colored
man. It presented a problem that had to be settled in some way. I think the reason
they didn't show up was because I told my investigator to say to these colored men,
"Next season if you have a sufficiently large group you can have a contest of your
own. We'll award the same prizes to colored wrestlers as we do to the white."
</p>
</div>

<p>
The representative of the Municipal Bureau also spoke of occasional
difficulty in wrestling, though there may be no objection to Negro participation
in other events. He said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have athletic meets in which a Negro team has competed and for five years
has won the championship in athletics. In baseball there is no trouble. The difficulty
comes in some of the activities, particularly wrestling, because of the nature of the
activity. It is a closer contact. We make no distinction, however, and when a
Negro boy gets up to face a white boy and the white boy doesn't face him, the bout
is forfeited to the Negro. I think more meet than fail to.
</p>
</div>

<p>
At Fiske Playground, where there are few Negroes, as they do not live
near, the investigator witnessed a baseball game with a team from Colman
Playground composed entirely of Negro boys except the pitcher. They played
as any teams would, with no evidence of racial antipathy. The Negro team
seemed to be the better, and according to the director had won every game
so far that season.
</p>

<p>
At McCosh, Robey, Carter, Oakland, Colman, Doolittle, and Beutner
playgrounds the children mingled without friction, according to the directors.
Negroes were in a minority at the first three and in a majority at the last
four. At Carter Playground the investigator witnessed the presentation of
a medal for athletics to one of the white boys while the Negro boys looked on
in admiration and, after it was over, invited the white boys to "come on out
and play ball." The only trouble that has been experienced at this playground
was a few days before the 1919 riot, when a fight between a white boy and a
Negro started on the playground and the spectators divided along racial lines,
especially after the fight was transferred to the street. A riot call was sent in,
and the police put a stop to the fight. No trouble has occurred since and the
director believed it could not happen again. "The boys have learned better,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Free mingling of Negro and white children was observed at Oakland and
Robey playgrounds and was encouraged by the directors. Italian and Negro
boys were playing ball together when the investigator visited Robey Playground,
and Negro and white girls were playing on the same slides. The
director said that in the evening the ball games were watched by both Negroes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
and whites, and that frequently the Negroes had a game themselves, which
white onlookers enjoyed watching. The only incident of importance at
Robey Playground had occurred a few days before, when a dispute over a
baseball game arose between a white boy of fourteen and two Negro boys of
eleven, resulting in a fight in which the director had to interfere. The director
said there was not the slightest chance that such a fight would divide the
playground along racial lines, as there had never been any disorders there,
and that animosity between the Negro and white groups was entirely lacking.
</p>

<p>
At Oakland Playground, where neither race predominated strongly, the
assistant director said there had never been any difficulty. The investigator
witnessed a ball game in which Negro and white girls participated and saw
groups of Negro and white boys talking outside the playground in a friendly
manner.
</p>

<p>
At Colman, Beutner, and Doolittle playgrounds, where the Negroes
come in the majority, no difficulties were reported. The Negro director of
Doolittle Playground encourages comradeship between Negro and white
children and allows no discrimination against white children. "If a white
boy can make a team, he makes it," this director says to a Negro team which
objects to a white boy being allowed to play on it. When this director was
assigned to Doolittle Playground he was told that 60 per cent of those who
made use of the playground were Negro and 40 per cent white. When he
got there he found that 70 per cent were white and 30 per cent were Negroes.
He said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I had to look around to find a colored child, but I never had any trouble. Of
course the white people gradually moved out and the colored people moved in. We
never had any trouble with colored boys or white boysâ€”they played on the same teams.
In fact, I think we won the district championship for four years. Then they moved
me over to the Beutner and the majority of the white children got up a petition to
bring me back to Doolittle Playground. That shows there was no distinction there.
They wanted me because we carried on activities.
</p>
</div>

<p>
White ball teams often use the field at Beutner Playground in spite of the
fact that Armour Square is only two blocks away. "Last year [1919] there
were several games between white and colored teams," said the assistant
director, "but there have been none so far in 1920."
</p>

<p>
No difficulties between Negroes and whites were reported at Palmer
Park, Bessemer Park, or Thorpe, Otis, and Orleans playgrounds, which are
patronized by a few Negroes, though they are too far away from the Negro
areas to be generally used.
</p>

<p>
The supervisor of girls' work in the Municipal Bureau made the following
statement in regard to the relations between the Negro and white children
visiting the municipal playgrounds:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
From my observation and supervision of the girls' work in the municipal playgrounds
I can only say that in all our activities colored and white children mingle
without restriction. In indoor gymnasium and dancing-classes as well as in games,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
athletics, and general informal use of the playground, they take part together. Ability
and sportsmanship are the only qualifications considered in candidates for any playground
team. In the field of adult recreation, since we have no community centers
conducting indoor activities in connection with any of our playgrounds within the
colored area, my observations refer only to outdoor gatherings. On such occasions
adults of both races mingle without friction. It is my experience that the most
harmonious relations are established in connection with band concerts, field days,
festivals, pageants, etc., including all forms of community art, which tend to unify
rather than to split those taking part. In the Illinois Centennial Pageant, presented
by groups from thirty-eight neighborhoods in 1918, girls from Doolittle Playground
represented "Dances of the New Freedom," bringing "Liberty and New Strength to
Illinois." In preparation of this episode several rehearsals were held at Doolittle
Playground, white dancers from other playgrounds taking part; and the interest
and co-operation shown by the neighbors made each evening memorable.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Voluntary racial grouping.</i>â€”Voluntary racial grouping appears to be a
characteristic of the large parks and beaches, which adults frequent, rather
than of the playgrounds which are used mainly by children. One instance
of voluntary grouping among children was found at Copernicus Playground.
The percentage of Negroes using this playground is much larger in summer
than in winter. The playing space is in the shape of an "L," one end intended
for boys and the other for girls, but by common consent the children divide
along race lines rather than sex. The investigator saw small white children
playing at one end of the playground, while Negro boys were playing ball in
the larger end. Later, after the Negro boys left, some of the white children
used the larger space while some Negro children collected around the apparatus
in the smaller end. No instance of mixed play was observed, but there seemed
to be no antagonism between the groups, and no disorders were reported.
</p>

<p>
The director of Union Park in speaking of boys who play games in the
recreation rooms, said that there seemed to be a tacit understanding between
the blacks and whites that they had certain nights. On certain nights all
the attendance would be black and on other nights it would all be white.
Asked whether Negro and white boys who were school friends played separately
at the park, the director said that blacks and whites often came in together,
but that for every case where they came in together and played a sociable
game, there were probably three instances where groups were either of one
race or the other. However, the director said that this grouping was casual,
and that there was no prevailing community sentiment that the Negroes
should use the park on separate nights. He believed that additional recreation
facilities would help greatly in doing away with this tendency to voluntary
segregation. He also said that the Negroes had a tendency to separate from
the whites, not because they wished to avoid them, but because they preferred
to associate with their own race.

<p>
In the general use of Lincoln and Washington parks the Negroes and
whites stay in separate groups. There has never been any difficulty, according
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
to the Lincoln Park representative, arising from the fact that Negroes have
taken possession of a spot desired by whites for a picnic or other amusement.
No part of either park is especially set aside for the use of one race,
and groups of both Negroes and whites are seen everywhere in the parks,
but they do not mingle. While there was no outward evidence of antagonism
toward Negroes at the time of the investigator's visit to Washington Park,
white visitors who were questioned showed an antipathy to the Negro which
seemed to have its basis in the influx of Negroes into the residence districts.
One man, originally from the South, was bitter against Negroes. He said he
had left the Socialist party because it accepted Negroes as equals. At an
open-air "free-speech" meeting speakers representing various radical doctrines
were addressing a crowd composed almost entirely of whites. The chairman
of the meeting, however, was a Negro, whose humorous remarks made him
popular with the white crowd.
</p>

<p>
The only place in Washington Park where there seemed to be a general
mingling of Negroes and whites was on the ball field. There were games in
which the two teams were composed entirely of Negroes, and games in which
the teams were composed entirely of whites; there were also games in which
both Negroes and whites were engaged. The investigator watched one game
in which vacancies on two teams from American Legion posts had been filled
by Negroes. There was the best of spirit between the players and among
the spectators. The white spectators were lined up along the first base line
and the Negro spectators along the third base line, but rooters and players
joked with each other with no sign of racial antagonism.
</p>

<p>
The South Park representative testified to the good feeling between
Negroes and whites at a baseball game, and said the whites often preferred
to watch the Negro games. At other points in the park, however, particularly
the tennis courts and the boathouse, difficulties between the races were reported.
These will be discussed in the next section on "Clashes."
</p>

<p>
Separate racial grouping is the general rule at the beaches, though it is not
always voluntary. At the Thirty-eighth Street Beach, for example, Negroes
are prevented by white boys and the park policeman from going into the water,
according to a Negro playground director. "Boys who live around there
from Thirty-ninth to Thirty-first Street have to swim at the street end between
Thirty-third and Thirty-second. They rock you if you go in." This director
was invited by white boys of the Vincennes Club to swim at Thirty-eighth
Street, but when he suggested bringing some Negro boys along the white boys
said, "Oh no, they can't come."

<p>
At the Diversey Beach in Lincoln Park both races go in the water, but a
Lincoln Park representative said that the few Negroes who used this beach
kept by themselves on one part of the beach, though there was no official
rule compelling them to do this. There have never been any racial disturbances
at this beach.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
</p>

<p>
From the Twenty-sixth Street Beach, which is patronized almost entirely
by Negroes, down to Thirty-sixth Street, Negroes and whites go into the water
in separate groups, except at Twenty-sixth Street, where the few whites who
go in mingle amicably with the Negroes. The investigator saw a white couple
who had gone out to a raft and could not get back rescued by a Negro life
guard. The other bathing-places along the shore for those ten blocks have
been allotted by custom exclusively to one race or the other. At Twenty-ninth
Street, where the 1919 riot started, a policeman is now stationed, and
no trouble has occurred since the riot, though many fights have started which
the police have stopped. Gangs of young men come from as far as Halsted
Street, according to the policemen, ready to fight at the slightest opportunity.
Fights usually occur because of some remark made by one group about a girl
in another group. On the whole, however, few Negroes come to Twenty-ninth
Street, the policeman said, going instead to Twenty-sixth Street.
</p>

<p>
At the beaches outside the main Negro area, such as Fifty-first Street
and Triangle Park, and Clarendon and Rogers Park beaches to the north, the
only Negro patrons are a few young children. The attendants at these
beaches believe there would be trouble if adult Negroes started to use them.
Negro children have been objected to at Clarendon Beach, where a man
asked the director to put a little girl out because "she was a nigger."
</p>

<p>
Several directors reported that the Negroes did not use the swimming-pools
much and segregated themselves when they did go in. The director at Union
Park said the Negroes did not use the swimming-pool in proportion to their
numbers, and that when they did use it, they came in small groups and confined
themselves to a certain part of the pool instead of mingling with the whites.
He said that there was nothing in the attitude of the white boys to make them
do this, but that it was the "natural impulse of the colored people to do that
in the swimming-pool." He thought that many Negroes did not use the pool
more because "they are afraid of the water." A Negro playground director
testified that he had frequently seen a white boy dive off one side of the pool
at Union Park when a Negro boy dived off the other side and hold the Negro
boy down until, when he came up, he was gasping for air.
</p>

<p>
The director of Ogden Park gave an incident that had occurred recently
at that park:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
One day I noticed three small colored girls sitting among the others in the "swimming
line" waiting for the doors to open. A few minutes afterward they were at the
end of the line. I tried to find out the reason but could discover nothing either from
the colored girls or the others. I saw that they went back to the place in the line they
had before and went to my office. Some minutes later I looked out and saw that while
the swimming had begun, these three had not gone in but were sitting there watching
the rest. I was unable to discover why they didn't go inâ€”they said merely that
they "didn't want to." Whether there was some threat or whether the girls were
naturally timid about going into the pool I do not know.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The representative of the South Park Commission said that in the South
Park district the parents were opposed to race contacts in swimming- and
wading-pools. "Not 10 per cent of the families will allow contact with
Negroes in the pools," he said.
</p>

<p>
None of the three natatoriums maintained by the Municipal Bureau is
patronized by Negroes, with the exception of the Washington Heights pool
which is used by a few Negro children in the summer. This pool is near a
Negro district, but the other two are remote from the Negro areas.
</p>

<p>
A distinction was made by several directors between formal and informal
activities at playgrounds and recreation centers. It was their theory that
Negroes and whites mingled successfully in informal activities, but not in
formal ones. "There is a difference in the informal use by children of a
playground and the use of a recreation building where there are clubs and
dances and classes and things of that sort," said the director of Armour Square.
"Children and adults come in individually to use the library and other facilities,
but there are no applications from organized groups of Negroes for any of the
facilities at Armour Square." The real distinction in most cases is probably
not between formal and informal use but between use by children and use
by adults, as the formal activities are those in which older children and adults
engage, as was pointed out by the representative of the West Chicago Commission.
</p>

<p>
<i>Clashes.</i>â€”Clashes between Negroes and whites at various places of recreation
are reported as far back as 1913. These clashes in the main have been
initiated by gangs of white boys. In 1913, for example, the secretary of boys'
work at the Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A. (for Negroes) conducted a party of nineteen
Negro boys from the Douglass Center Boys' Club to Armour Square. They
had no difficulty in entering the park and carrying out their program of
athletics. The party then took shower baths in the field house. The
Y.M.C.A. secretary had noticed the increasing crowds of white boys near-by
but had no misgivings until the party left the park. Then they were assailed
with sandbags, tripped, walked over, and some of them badly bruised. They
were obliged to take refuge in neighboring saloons and houses in Thirty-third
Street west of Shields Avenue. For fully half an hour their way home was
blocked, until a detachment of city police, called by the park police, scattered
the white gang.
</p>

<p>
That same year the Y.M.C.A. secretary had found it impossible to proceed
east through Thirty-first Street to the lake with groups of Negro boys. When
this was tried they inevitably met gangs of white boys, and fights ensued
with any missiles procurable. Attempts to overcome this antagonism by
continuing to demonstrate that the Negro boys had a right to use these streets
were unavailing for the next two years.
</p>

<p>
In 1915 similar conflicts occurred. That winter Father Bishop, of St.
Thomas Episcopal Church, took a group of the Negro Y.M.C.A. boys to Armour
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
Square to play basket-ball. The party, including Father Bishop, was beaten
up by white boys, their sweaters were taken from them, and they were otherwise
maltreated. The Y.M.C.A. staff then decided not to attempt to use the park
or field house during the evenings.
</p>

<p>
The same year an attempt was made to take seventy-five of these boys
through the Stock Yards. They had received tickets of admission to the
annual stock show, in the pavilion at "the Yards." In spite of the four adult
leaders, several of the boys were struck by sticks and other missiles while passing
from one section of the show to another. The gang of white boys continually
increased in numbers, and the situation by three o'clock, two hours after the
Negroes had entered, began to look desperate. Police assistance was required
to get the Negro boys safely out of the building and into street cars. No
effort was made to restrain the white gangsters, who were allowed to range
through the building at will.
</p>

<p>
An altercation between white and Negro boys in Washington Park is on
record as early as the summer of 1913. These boys were sixteen or seventeen
years of age. During the spring and summer of 1919, numerous outbreaks
occurred because of the use of the baseball diamonds in Washington Park
by Negro players. White gangs from the neighborhood of Fifty-ninth Street
and Wentworth Avenue, not far from the park, also came there to play baseball,
among them some of "Ragen's Colts."<a name='FA_44' id='FA_44' href='#FN_44' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a> Gang fights frequently followed
the games. Park policemen usually succeeded in scattering the combatants.
The same season gangs of white boys from sixteen to twenty years of age
frequently annoyed Negro couples on the benches of this park. When the
Negroes showed fight, minor clashes often resulted.
</p>

<p>
In Ogden Park, as far back as 1914, there were similar instances of race
antipathy, expressed by hoodlums who were more or less organized. A Negro
playground director said that if Negro boys attended band concerts in that
park, white gangs would wait for them outside the park, and the Negroes
were slugged. The white gangs also tried to keep Negro boys from using the
shower baths at the park. This director told how a party of Negroes whom
he had taken there was surrounded by white gangsters when they emerged
from the shower house. "A boy reached around and caught me and pulled
me up close to the other fellow," he said. "I dug down and got out. Of
course they rushed for me. In the rush the other colored lads got out. Brass
knuckles were used on me. When I looked up they said, 'My God, you have
hit Lâ€”; you have hit the wrong fellow.'" The director declares that the
man who hit him with the brass knuckles was discharged by the court with a
reprimand.
</p>

<p>
This condition in the parks continued up to the early summer of 1920.
George R. Arthur, secretary of the Negro Y.M.C.A. branch, expressed the fear
at that time that a riot might occur in Washington Park any Sunday afternoon.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
He described the condition in the vicinity of the boathouse in that park as
"fierce." There were fights there every Sunday. Five white men had beaten
a Negro there one night the previous week. That sort of thing had been
going on for years, he said. The Y.M.C.A. had long been dealing with the
situation but he had noticed this trouble especially in the last two years.
He attributed it to the gang spirit and to racial antipathy, which ordinarily
would not amount to much, but which because of the tense situation in Chicago
might lead to serious riots.
</p>

<p>
The director of the Negro branch of Community Service of Chicago
ascribed the trouble to the same source. He said that most of the white boys
came to Washington Park from the "Ragen's Colts" Club, that some of them
went to poolrooms where the mischief was hatched. There was but one
policeman in charge of about fifteen baseball games in the park, he said.
</p>

<p>
The racial difficulties at the baseball fields in Washington Park had doubtless
never been brought to the attention of the representative of the South
Park Commission, because he cited these games as an example of good feeling
between the two races. He believed that there was never any difficulty at
the baseball fields, and that the white people who enjoyed the Negro games
would be the first to object if the Negroes were not permitted to play in the
park. This opinion coincides with the situation at the ball fields observed by
the investigator for the Commission, but apparently there are occasional clashes
here as in other parts of the park.
</p>

<p>
The representative of the South Park Commission did not think Negroes
hesitated to use any of the facilities of the park because of fear of mistreatment
in the park, though they might have some fear of being mistreated
outside the park. He did not know that any difficulties have ever occurred
at the boathouse, though a Negro doctor testified that he had treated many
Negro boys who had been assaulted there. The South Park representative
said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have never known of any actual abuse of a colored patron in any park to which
I was personally assigned. I have known people coming and going who were abused,
mistreated, and actually assaulted, outside the park reservations, but I don't believe
our records would show very many casesâ€”probably no more than occur where the
Poles and the Irish get together, or the Bohemians and the Germans.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Fights of a racial character were reported at one or two playgrounds. At
Franklin Playground, where fights among boys between ten and fourteen are
frequent, the director said he was always especially careful to stop a fight
between a white and Negro boy because "a race riot would be easy to start."
</p>

<p>
At Sherwood Playground Negro children do not use the playground after
school hours or during the summer. The attendant declared that "things
used to be mighty rough but are better now." The change may have been
due to a younger group of children replacing the former pupils, among whom
were many children fourteen to seventeen years of age. There was much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
fighting between Negroes and whites in the neighborhood of Sherwood Playground,
according to the attendant. Street fights were frequent, often ending
in the use of knives or stones, and numerous arrests had been made. The
fight usually started between two boys over some trivial dispute, a mixed
crowd gathered, and the fight became general. Fights were also frequent
within the playground, the attendant said; sometimes as many as three
were going on at once. But a policeman had been stationed near-by, and
conditions were improving. The playground had no director at the time it
was visited.
</p>

<p>
An example of objection to the first Negroes appearing in a park was
given by an official of the Municipal Bureau:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I remember a particular instance at the Beutner Playground in about 1903.
Prior to that time we had very few colored people in that vicinity. One evening a
young colored boy, probably seventeen or eighteen years of age, came in there. I
happened to be on the athletic field at that time. He came in the rear gate, and the
first thing I noticed there was quite a crowd of white fellows chasing this fellow all
over the field. He ran down to where the Armory now stands, doubled, and came
back and got out of the gates.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This official said that after that incident there was little trouble between
the races at the playground until about 1910, when the balance of the patronage
became almost equal. He continued:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
That was when the trouble started. There wasn't any preference shown on the
part of the park management to any particular race, but it was the people outside.
They absolutely took the stand that as long as they could keep the colored people
away they were going to do it. They used every means they could to keep the colored
people away from Beutner Playground and Armour Square.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another instance of whites objecting to the use of recreation facilities
for the first time by Negroes was given by the representative of the West
Chicago Commission:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Not long ago, two colored men, for the first time in the history of Garfield Park,
came out there to play tennis. Immediately somebody in the neighborhood called
up the Park Board and complained about Negroes breaking into Garfield Park.
We frankly told the people who were complaining that they had equal rights to the
use of the facilities at Garfield Park. But it seemed that while we said nothing,
the colored gentlemen never appeared again to use the tennis facilities.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The representative of the South Park Commission in commenting on this
same point said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There is a history of development in amicable race relations. Most of the
troublous conditions are where there is injected for the first time the question of
racial intermingling. Where it is established, where it has gradually grown up, in
time there comes an adjustment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
At Armour Square individual Negroes have been accepted as "part of the
scheme," according to the representative of the South Park Commission,
practically ever since the park was opened. But the director says that it is
group action which stirs up trouble:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think the trouble will adjust itself as the colored people continue to come into
the neighborhood, but we are in the situation of having colored people come into the
neighborhood where there haven't been any before. I think it will adjust itself in
a year or so, and that possibly at that time colored people will begin coming.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The head of the Municipal Bureau thought the difficulties arose, not when
Negroes first entered a white neighborhood, but when a balance between the
two races was struck, and it was a question which race was going to predominate.
"That has been my experience with the municipal playgrounds,"
he said, citing the case of the Beutner Playground which the Municipal Board
decided to turn over to the Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Where Negroes are accepted and live amicably near white people, or where
there has not been enough influx of Negroes to arouse feeling against them
the contacts in the playground are usually peaceful. On the other hand,
in communities where Negroes are looked on as intruders and objectionable
neighbors, and where the white people are antagonistic, a contact between a
Negro and white child, which would normally be peaceful, will result in a
disturbance and tend to increase existing antagonism. This is the situation at
Moseley and Sherwood playgrounds.
</p>

<p>
At Thirty-eighth Street Beach the prejudice is such as to prevent any Negro
from bathing there, although it is as near the center of the main Negro area
as the Twenty-sixth Street Beach, to which Negroes are expected to confine
themselves. At Armour Square neighborhood sentiment permits a few Negroes
to use the park, but trouble starts if new groups come. At Ogden Park a
Negro playground director was assaulted by white boys and hit with brass
knuckles in 1914, but now, according to a prominent Negro familiar with the
situation at the center, there is order and fair treatment both within the park
and on the way to it, and the Negroes prefer to travel out there than to go
to Washington Park, which is closer at hand, but where they may be attacked
if they try to use a boat or may be obliged to wait indefinitely for a tennis
court.
</p>

<p>
The use of the parks by Negroes is determined almost entirely by the degree
of antagonism in the neighborhood, and Negroes are afraid to make use of
the parks where the neighborhood sentiment is hostile. "The neighborhood
condition pretty much governs the feeling of security, on the basis of which
the Negro will come in and use our park facilities," said the representative
of the South Park Commission. "Without feeling secure in his neighborhood
and in his access to the park, I don't think anything we could do would pull
the Negro in."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
</p>

<p class="caption">A NEGRO AMATEUR BASEBALL TEAM</p>
</div>

<p>
At Mitchell Playground, in a district with a reputation for lawlessness,
and at Seward Park, two blocks from a region known as "Little Hell," no
racial difficulty is reported.
</p>

<p>
The two causes of neighborhood antagonism most commonly cited were
the real estate and the sex problems. Among visitors to Washington Park
the real estate problem in the residence districts near the park seemed to be
the primary cause of ill feeling. One of the property owners in that region
showed his feeling by complaining that the park ought to be rechristened
"Booker T. Washington Park." The figures in Table I indicate that only
about 10 per cent of the patrons of the park are Negroes.
</p>

<p>
An important point in considering neighborhood sentiment is whether the
white hoodlum who appears to be mainly responsible for the clashes which
have taken place is a cause of neighborhood antagonism or whether he merely
reflects the attitude of the community. The fact that the hoodlum is permitted
to terrorize and mistreat Negroes without serious protest from whites is an
indication that the hoodlum expresses what the white community feels. The
hoodlum does not always live, however, in the immediate neighborhood of
the place of recreation where he makes trouble. The gangs of white boys
who come down to Twenty-ninth Street Beach and start trouble, for example,
do not live near the beach, the policeman in charge says, but over at Halsted
Street. The director of Armour Square, though she stated that the feeling
in the immediate neighborhood of the park was responsible for keeping Negroes
away from Armour Square, said that the boys who were active in starting
trouble at the time of the 1919 riot came from west of the park, and that the
boys in her vicinity tried to stop the others.
</p>

<p>
The head of the girls' work in the Municipal Bureau said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It [hoodlumism] is a symptom, the reflection and logical carrying out of an attitude
widely accepted by the community as a whole. Although a serious and troublesome
symptom, I believe it should be faced and welcomed as evidence of the potential
brutality of this attitude. Men and women of good standing in white society condone
much that they would hesitate to do in person; and by their failure to protest prove
themselves equally responsible for results.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The director of Fuller Park believed that the groups of hoodlums mainly
responsible for keeping Negroes out of the parks were the athletic clubs "composed
usually of a bunch of young sports that are not athletes at all." "These
clubs, which have only about one athlete on the roster," he said, "are so situated
that the Negroes have to pass them going to and from the park. Those are
the boys, numerous in every park neighborhood, who are keeping the colored
people out of the parks."
</p>

<p>
The director of Ogden Park took the part of a Negro boy set upon by a
white gang during the 1919 riot and rescued by the police, though they did
not keep the mob from killing the Negro. He advocated the formation of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
"square-deal" clubs to defend innocent people from hoodlums. "Members
would be bound to fight for the square dealâ€”whites against white hoodlums
and blacks against black hoodlums," he said. "Until both races will act,
the lawless elements will continue to cause trouble."
</p>

<p>
It is possible in some cases, such as those in which the "athletic clubs"
are involved, to find out the identity of boys who molest Negroes, but, according
to the testimony of several park directors, it is absolutely impossible to control
these boys because the courts will not convict them. The director of Armour
Square stated:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have had boys taken down to the courts time after time, and now my policeman
refuses to take them down to the court any more, because he is reprimanded when he
brings them in.... One of our attendants was shot through the lung and is now
absolutely incapacitated for work, and the policeman was reprimanded because he
had kept the boy in jail two nights. When it came to trial, they had already seen
somebody and the policeman got the reprimand.
</p>
</div>

<p>
There was a general feeling among park representatives that the presence
of a director with a proper attitude toward the problem was the greatest
factor in bringing about amicable relations within the park, but there was
considerable difference of opinion as to whether the park management could
or should attempt to influence the surrounding neighborhood. The West
Chicago Commission representative said that there was no instructor at
Union Park the first year it was open, and that considerable segregation and
undesirable conduct on the part of both whites and Negroes resulted. Since
then, there had always been a director in charge, and a very harmonious mingling
of the two races had been brought about on the playground. He believed
that a similar relationship could be brought about within the recreation building
by a director with the right personality, if adequate facilities were provided.
</p>

<p>
The Seward Park director did not consider it a proper function of a recreation
center to try to direct the community life outside it.
</p>

<p>
The director of Armour Square felt that she could do nothing to promote
Negro activities there. She did not approve of the suggestion of turning over
Armour Square to the Negroes as the best way of solving the problem. She
thought this would result in ill feeling and trouble, since there was a well-established
tradition that the whites should use Armour Square to the fullest
extent. But since the Negroes had no such recreation center as Armour
Square available to them, she believed that a new center with full equipment
should be started in a neighborhood part white and part Negro with the understanding
that it should be a Negro recreation center where the whites were
welcome if they wished to come. She thought that white people would patronize
such a recreation center and, with careful leadership, would mingle with
the Negroes on friendly and peaceable terms.
</p>

<p>
Two recreation-center directors favored entirely separate recreational
facilities for Negroes with whites excluded. One of these was the director
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
of Fuller Park, who told the Commission that he had made every effort to get
Negroes to come to the park, and that he considered it part of his duty to go
out into the neighborhood and try to get Negroes to use the park. "Separate
parks and playgrounds for colored people are advisable," he said, "not because
one group is any better than the other, but because they are different. Human
nature will have to be remodeled before racial antipathy is overcome."
</p>

<p>
The director of Hardin Square, another recreation center little used by
Negroes, though it is near the main Negro area, believed that separate facilities
for each race would be the best solution of the problem. He did not encourage
Negroes to come to Hardin Square. The policeman at the park also believed
that "you can't make the two colors mix." This policeman said he knows
a group of young men in the district, mostly ex-service men, who would
"procure arms and fight shoulder to shoulder with me if a Negro should say
one word back to me or should say a word to a white woman." He thought
it would not take much to start another riot, and that the white people of the
district would resolve to make a "complete clean-up this time." This policeman
is the one whose failure to arrest a white man accused of stoning the Negro
boy, Williams, at the Twenty-sixth Street Beach was an important factor in precipitating
the riot in 1919.
</p>

<p>
The director of Moseley Playground, who was born and raised in that
vicinity, said there had been antagonism between the two races in that neighborhood
for thirty years. He believed that separate recreation facilities
would be impracticable because the taxpayers could not be divided in such a
way that they would not be paying for fields their children could not use.
</p>

<p>
The director of Seward Park thought that it might be arranged in the
small parks to give special hours to Negro groups. This would meet what
he believed to be the desire of the Negroes to be by themselves and also the
objection of the white girls who had protested against having Negro girls in
the same gymnasium classes with them.
</p>

<h4>
V. TRAINING FOR RECREATION DIRECTORS
</h4>

<p>
The importance of the personality of the park director in determining
the conditions in the park, which was often emphasized, led to a consideration
of the training for the workâ€”whether training was required that would develop
the understanding and vision necessary to handle the problems involved in
racial contacts. The representative of the Municipal Bureau said that every
effort had been made to get trained men, but that there was no school or curriculum
of training that determined the efficiency of a person in charge. Some
of his best directors had had no specific training, while some of the poorest
came from the best recreational training schools.
</p>

<p>
Few Negro instructors were found at the places of recreation and these
were employed by the Municipal Bureau. The representative of the West
Side Commission said that he had been trying for a long time without success
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
to get a Negro to take the civil-service examination for playground instructors,
as he was anxious to get a Negro for Union Park. The representatives of the
Lincoln and South Park commissions said that they used Negroes only as
life guards, attendants, janitors, etc. The South Park Commission representative
said the question of the desirability of having Negro instructors and play
leaders had never come up, because no Negro had ever become a candidate
for a position as a result of the competitive examinations.
</p>

<p>
<i>Training opportunities for Negroes.</i>â€”It was found that the Y.M.C.A. has
a four-year recreational training-course in which no distinction is made between
Negroes and whites. As the courses are not open to women, the Y.M.C.A.
has no such race problem as arises in recreation courses where women are
admitted. The president of the graduating class at the Y.M.C.A. College
the year previous was a Negro, though the rest of the class was composed
entirely of whites. The number of Negroes taking the Y.M.C.A. recreation
course is relatively small, usually about two in a class of 150.
</p>

<p>
The American College of Physical Education and the Chicago Normal
School of Physical Education reported that they did not admit Negroes to
any courses, saying that their students would object to physical contact with
Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The Recreation Training School of Chicago, successor to the Recreation
Department of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, admits Negroes
to the recreation course on the same terms as all other students and has trained
several, both in the short courses and in the full year's course. This school
admits both men and women.
</p>

<h4>
VI. SUMMARY
</h4>

<p>
Though the Negro areas are as well supplied with ordinary playgrounds
as the rest of the city, they are noticeably lacking in more complete recreation
centers with indoor facilities for the use of older children and adults. Several
of these recreation centers, such as Hardin, Armour, and Fuller squares,
Stanton and Ogden parks, border on Negro areas but are not used to any great
extent by Negroes because the Negroes feel that the whites object to their
presence. Though there are three publicly maintained beaches within the
main Negro area the Negroes feel free to use only the Twenty-sixth Street
Beach, though many of them live as far south as Sixty-sixth Street. Where
Negroes do not use nearby facilities to any great extent they have usually
either been given to understand, through unofficial discrimination, that they
are not desired, or they have been terrorized by gangs of white boys.
Few attempts to encourage Negro attendance have been made, and with the
exception of Union Park these attempts have failed.
</p>

<p>
In the main there seem to be no difficulties arising from contacts between
young white and Negro children at the playgrounds, no matter whether the
playground is predominantly white or predominantly Negro, with the exception
of one or two playgrounds, such as Sherwood and Moseley, which seem
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
to share in traditional neighborhood antagonism between the two races.
Voluntary racial grouping at the playground was found only in rare instances
and usually involved the older rather than the younger children. The
swimming-pools, for example, are patronized more by older children, and
voluntary racial grouping at swimming-pools was reported in several instances.
In the ordinary playground sports and athletic contests the two races mingle
with the best of feeling.
</p>

<p>
Voluntary racial groupings and serious clashes are found mainly at the
places of recreation patronized by older children and adultsâ€”the large parks,
beaches, and recreation centers. Trouble is usually started by gangs of white
boys, organized and unorganized. The members of so-called "athletic clubs,"
whose rooms usually border on the park, are the worst offenders in this respect.
If they do not reflect the community feeling they are at least tolerated by it,
as nothing is done to suppress them. Some park authorities that have made
sincere efforts to have these hoodlums punished are discouraged because
they get no co-operation from the courts, and the policeman who takes the
boy to court gets a reprimand, while the boy is dismissed.
</p>

<p>
Another source of racial disorder is the lack of co-ordination between
park and city police. The park police stop a fight between a white child and a
Negro child and send them from the park. Outside the park gates the children
start fighting again, and the park police have no power to interfere. The
spectators may then get into the fight, dividing along racial lines, and before
the city police can be summoned a race riot may be well under way. Either
city police should be stationed directly outside every park, ready to co-operate
with the park police, or else the jurisdiction of the park police should be
extended to include the area immediately surrounding the park.
</p>

<p>
The most important remedies suggested to the Commission for the betterment
of relations between Negroes and whites at the various places of recreation
were: (1) additional facilities in Negro areas, particularly recreation centers
which can be used by adults; (2) an awakened public opinion which will refuse
longer to tolerate the hoodlum and will insist that the courts properly punish
such offenders; (3) selection of directors for parks in neighborhoods where
there is a critical situation who will have a sympathetic understanding of the
problem and will not tolerate actions by park police officers and other subordinate
officials tending to discourage Negro attendance; and (4) efforts by such
directors to repress and remove any racial antagonism that may arise in the
neighborhood about the park.

<h3>
D. CONTACTS IN TRANSPORTATION
</h3>

<h4>
I. INTRODUCTION
</h4>

<p>
<i>Volume of traffic.</i>â€”The number of passengers carried in 1916 in a twenty-four-hour
day by the Chicago surface lines was 3,500,000 and by the elevated
railway lines 560,000, according to a tabulation made by the Chicago Traction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
and Subway Commission in 1916. With the city's growth in population the
traffic in 1920 doubtless showed an even larger volume. This traffic is distributed
over approximately 1,050 miles of surface and 142 miles of elevated
track. It is most congested in the "Loop" area of the downtown business
section, which is a transfer center for the three sides of the city, North, South,
and West; and of course it is heaviest at the hours when people go to and
from work.
</p>

<p>
<i>Concentration of Negro traffic.</i>â€”Negroes constitute 4 per cent of the city's
population, according to the federal census for 1920, and presumably about
that percentage of the city's street-car traffic. The Negro traffic, however,
instead of being scattered all over the city, is mainly concentrated upon twelve
lines which traverse the Negro residence areas and connect them with the
manufacturing districts where Negroes are largely employed. These twelve
lines, which are shown on the two transportation diagrams <a href="#i-427">facing page 300</a>, cover
11 per cent of the total mileage of the surface and elevated lines. Because
of this concentration, however, the proportion of Negroes to whites on these
twelve lines is much higher than 4 per cent, and on such lines as that on State
Street, which runs along the principal business street of the main South Side
Negro residence area, it often happens that the majority of the passengers
are Negroes. In addition to these twelve lines of heaviest Negro traffic, there
are others traversing less densely populated parts of Negro residence areas.
In varying degrees contacts of Negroes and whites may be found on other lines
which serve the small proportion of the Negro population scattered throughout
the city.
</p>

<p>
The main area of Negro residence, on the South Side, where about 90
per cent of the Negroes in Chicago live, is traversed by the State Street, Indiana
Avenue, Cottage Grove Avenue, Stony Island Avenue, and the South Side
elevated lines, running north and south, and by eleven cross-town lines, running
east and west, beginning with the Twenty-second Street line at the north and
ending with the Seventy-first Street line at the south. From six to nine
o'clock in the morning, and from four to six o'clock in the afternoon, there is
a heavy Negro traffic on the lines going north to the "Loop," on the Cottage
Grove Avenue line going south to the South Chicago manufacturing district,
and on the Thirty-fifth Street and Forty-seventh Street lines and the elevated
branch line at Fortieth Street going west to the Stock Yards. To reach the
Stock Yards, Negro laborers must ride through a territory between Wentworth
Avenue and Halsted Street in which, as shown in the sections of the report
dealing with housing and with racial clashes, hostility toward Negroes has often
been displayed. This Negro traffic west of Wentworth Avenue is, therefore,
chiefly confined to a few hours in the morning and the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
The West Side Negro residence area is connected with the "Loop" by the
Madison Street and Lake Street surface lines, and the elevated line on Lake
Street, and with the Stock Yards by the Halsted Street and Ashland Avenue lines.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The North Side Negro residence area is connected with the "Loop" by
the lines on State and Clark streets and by the Northwestern elevated lines.
Contacts on these lines, however, are not as important as on the lines serving
the South and West Side areas, because the number of Negroes involved is
only about 1,500, or less than 2 per cent of the Negro population.
</p>

<p>
<i>Contacts and racial attitudes.</i>â€”As in other northern cities, there is no "Jim
Crow" separation of the races on street cars in Chicago. The contacts of
Negroes and whites on the street cars never provoked any considerable discussion
until the period of Negro migration from the South, when occasional
stories of clashes began to be circulated, but only one such incident was reported
in the newspapers. Even since the migration began there have been
few complaints based upon racial friction in transportation contacts.
</p>

<p>
In response to inquiries, the South Side Elevated Company, which has the
largest Negro traffic of any elevated line, replied that except during the riot
in 1919, when a few cases of racial disorder were reported, there had been no
complaints from motormen or trainmen since 1918, when a trainman was cut
by a Negro but not seriously injured. No complaints from white passengers
had been received since the spring of 1917, when white office workers objected
to riding with Stock Yards laborers, mainly Negroes, on the Stock Yards spur
of the elevated. White laborers in the Stock Yards mostly lived within walking
distance of their work, but Negroes found it necessary to use car lines running
east to the main Negro-residence area. The Chicago Surface Lines replied
that complaints due to racial friction were negligible.
</p>

<p>
Information obtained by investigators for the Commission showed that
the attitude of Negroes and whites toward each other was being affected by
contacts on the cars. A white woman in the Hyde Park district, an officer
of the Illinois Federation of Woman's Clubs, when interviewed upon race
relations, made special reference to transportation contacts. She said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
While Negroes are coming into this neighborhood, especially on Lake Park,
I see little of them, except on the street car. There I must say I have a decided
opinion. Just last evening around five o'clock, I took a Lake Park car at Fortieth
Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, and several colored men saw to it that they were
first to board the car. I had to sit near the front and a great big Negro man sat next
to me, smoking a cigar right in the car. I told my husband when I got home, I was
for moving them all out of the city, and I never felt like that toward them until just
of late. There's a feeling of resentment among us white people toward the colored
people on the cars, and they feel that, and they feel the same resentment toward us.
I think I see that very plainly. Last night, on this same car, a colored man was
hanging over me, and I know he didn't want me there near him, any more than
I wanted him.
</p>
</div>

<p>
As a factor in attitudes on race relations, transportation contacts, while
impersonal and temporary, are significant for several reasons. In the first
place, many whites have no contact with Negroes except on the cars, and their
personal impressions of the entire Negro group may be determined by one or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
two observations of Negro passengers. Secondly, transportation contacts are
not supervised, as are contacts in the school, the playground, and the workshop.
If there is a dispute between passengers over a seat it usually rests with the
passengers themselves to come to an understanding. Any feeling of suspicion
or prejudice on either side because of the difference in race accentuates any
such misunderstanding. In the third place, transportation contacts, at least
on crowded cars, involve a degree of physical contact between Negroes and
whites which rarely occurs under other circumstances, and which sometimes
leads to a display of racial feeling.
</p>

<p>
<i>Scope and method of investigation.</i>â€”In obtaining information as to transportation
contacts the Commission's investigators, both white and Negro, men
and women, made many observation trips on the twelve lines carrying the
heaviest volume of Negro traffic and therefore involving the greatest amount
of contact. Counts of passengers, Negro and white, were made, behavior
and habits were noted, passengers and car crews were questioned, and officials
of the surface and elevated lines, starters, and station men were interviewed.
</p>

<p>
Superintendents of 123 industrial plants were interviewed to ascertain
the numbers of whites and Negroes employed in offices and in plants, transportation
lines used by workers, nature of work and its effect upon cleanliness of
person and clothing, provision of baths, etc. A further source of information
was a report made for the officers of the Central Manufacturing District,
setting forth the transportation facilities for the 12,000 employees of the
district and providing data drawn from questionnaires filled out by these
employees. The district includes the area from Thirty-fifth to Forty-third
streets and from Morgan to Robey streets.
</p>

<h4>
II. DISTRIBUTION OF NEGRO TRAFFIC
</h4>

<p>
Negro traffic is fairly continuous throughout the day in the Negro residence
areas, and the proportion of Negroes and whites is about the same at different
hours of the day. Except during the times of going to and from work the cars
are not overcrowded, and the danger of friction is therefore small. On the
routes connecting the Negro residence areas with the Stock Yards and with
South Chicago, where many Negroes are employed in steel plants, the Negro
traffic is confined to a few hours in the morning and late afternoon, but at these
hours the cars are very crowded. There is much rushing to board cars and
get seats, and white office workers and other non-laborers are thrown into
contact with Negro laborers still in their working clothes. It is under such
circumstances that irritation and actual clashes are most likely to arise. It
should be noted that similar contacts with white laborers in their working
clothes are disagreeable in the same ways, though in such cases the odors and
grime are not associated with race and color.

The hours of greatest general travel and car crowding were found to be
from six to nine o'clock in the morning and from four to six o'clock in the
afternoon.

The proportions of whites and Negroes on lines carrying the largest numbers
of Negroes to and from work are shown in two diagrams. These are based
on counts of white and Negro passengers, several trips being averaged to show
typical car loads during the heavy travel of early morning and late afternoon.

areas of the South and West sides toward the Stock Yards, the other large
industries employing Negroes, and the "Loop" district during the period from
six to nine <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The second diagram shows the proportions in travel from the
Stock Yards, the other industries, and the "Loop" toward the Negro residence

</p>

<h4>
III. CONDUCT RESULTING FROM CONTACTS
</h4>

<p>
As already noted, contacts of Negroes and whites on street cars provoked
little discussion until the migration of Negroes from the South began to be
felt. The great majority of the migrants are laborers. Many of them are
ignorant and rough mannered, entirely unfamiliar with standards of conduct
in northern cities. It is this type which is meant in references hereinafter
to the "migration" or "southern" Negro.
</p>

<p>
Coming to a city like Chicago, with no "Jim Crow" racial segregation,
was a new experience to many southern Negroes. They felt strange and
uncertain as to how they should act. Many whites and Negroes long resident
in Chicago have said that they could tell a migration Negro by his ill-at-ease
manner and often by his clothes.
</p>

<p>
The conspicuous points in the behavior of the migration Negro before he
became urbanized were his "loud laughing and talking," his "ill-smelling
clothes," his "roughness," and his tendency to "sit all over the car." These
are easier to understand when one considers the background of the southern
Negro.
</p>

<p>
Few white people realized how uncertain the southern Negro felt about
making use of his new privilege of sitting anywhere in the car, instead of being
"Jim Crowed." One Negro woman who came to the city during the migration
said, when she was asked about her first impression of Chicago: "When I got
here and got on the street cars and saw colored people sitting by white people,
I just held my breath, for I thought any minute they would start something.
Then I saw nobody noticed it, and I just thought this is a real place for
Negroes." There were exceptional cases in which southern Negroes walked
miles, rather than take a car.
</p>

<p>
It may seem strange in view of such uncertainty of mind and timidity that
the most noticeable point of behavior of the southern Negro was loud talking,
joking, and laughter. The South Side Elevated Company, replying to the
Commission's inquiries, said: "These colored people are of a happy-go-lucky
type and are often noisy, especially when two or more acquaintances meet
on the trains or station platforms or crossing from one side of the station to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
the other. They laugh and talk a good deal and seem to be happy and care-free."
</p>

<p>
Although some of this boisterousness was no doubt due to a care-free
spirit and a broad good humor, some of it had quite a different source. Many
a southern Negro thinks that the whites like him to be "typical," and that
they will tolerate him as long as his dialect, his wit, and his manner are amusing
enough. A Negro newspaper of Chicago took the southern Negroes to task
for using this safety device in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Many whites, clerical workers, shoppers, and others of a non-laboring
type, have expressed objections to what they term a tendency of Negroes to
"sit all over the cars," meaning to sit anywhere in the car. This was most
conspicuous when whites had to ride in the morning on a car which had come
from one of the Negro residence areas and was already filled with Negroes,
or when Negroes and whites were boarding a comparatively empty car near one
of the big industrial plants in the afternoon. The employment manager of the
Corn Products Company plant at Argo reported a complaint about this
tendency made to him by one of the girls in the office:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
An office girl told me she had trouble getting a seat on the cars. She was not
able to get a seat by herself and did not want to sit next to a Negro. She said that
Negroes would rush in and get all the seats by the windows. She thought they did
it more to tease the office help than anything else. This girl was undoubtedly prejudiced.
That was one of her arguments to explain why she had difficulty in getting
to work in the morning. She is a St. Louis girl of Flemish extraction.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Many of the southern Negroes were found to be very hesitant about taking
seats next to whites. The southern tradition was so ingrained in them that
they tried to be as inconspicuous as possible. On the other hand, some,
with the sudden removal of the restraints of the South, used their new freedom
without thought of the effect of their behavior on Chicago whites and Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The attitude of migration Negroes was sometimes expressed to the Commission's
investigators. For example:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
You can spend your money as you please, live better and get more enjoyment
out of itâ€”I mean go where you please, without being Jim-Crowed.
</p>

<p class="p2">
There's no lynching or Jim Crow. You can vote, you receive better treatment
and more money for your work.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The freedom of speech and action. You can live without fear and there's no
Jim Crow.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Some southern Negroes apparently came to Chicago with a real grudge
against all whites and ready at slight provocation to display their resentment.
The minister of one of the Negro churches in Chicago said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
After years of restriction and proscription to which they were subjected in the
South, they suddenly find themselves freed in a large measure of these conditions.
Their mind harks back to that which they endured at the hands of members of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
Aryan race in the South, and they grow resentful, and in the midst of their new
environment they vent their spleen. One has but to ride on any of the surface lines
running into the section of Chicago largely occupied by my race group to be convinced
of the facts mentioned above.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The southern Negro who got into trouble with whites by insisting on his
right to a seat sometimes belonged to the class of suspicious and sensitive
Negroes, and sometimes he was simply a "greenhorn." The following cases
show how "green" the migration Negro could be, and how easy it was for him
to make himself disliked and ridiculous. The first case was observed by a
Negro man, the second by a Negro woman, both long resident in Chicago:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I boarded a crowded car in the "Loop" going south and was forced to stand near
the rear door. There are two lengthwise seats at the rear of the car, one of which will
hold three people and one of which will hold two. Two colored women, carelessly
dressed and holding greasy paper bundles in their hands, got on the car at Twelfth
Street and stood in the back of the car hanging on to straps. They rode this way
until Eighteenth Street, when one of them, a large woman, noticing that there were
three white people on one of the seats and only two on the other said to her companion,
"If three folks can sit on that seat, I ain't going to stand over these white folks,
who are just like they are down South, and don't want you to sit down. I'm going
to sit down myself." She then inserted herself between the two white women,
one of whom was pushed to the floor. The Negro woman was much embarrassed,
but I don't think she has yet realized that the seats were of different lengths.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I was on a State Street car when two southern Negro women got on, talking loud,
and throwing themselves around loose and careless like. I was sitting on one of the
end seats, just big enough for three, and one of the women says to the other, "Here's
a seat, here's a seat." "You move over," she said to me. There was fire in their
eyes, and I don't like fighting, so I made up my mind that if they started anything
I'd get up and give them my seat. Most people would have understood how you
felt if you did that, but I am not sure they would have understood. I said to one of
them, "There really isn't room on this seat." She gave me a shove, so I said, "But
I'll get up and give you my seat." You wouldn't believe what happened then.
The conductor came in and said, "You just keep your seat." And a white man,
who was sitting in one of the cross-seats, turned around and said, "I'll see that she
does."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Soiled and ill-smelling clothes were a large factor in making Negro workingmen
objectionable to many whites even of the same working class.
</p>

<p>
At the time of the migration, in the fall of 1916 and the spring of 1917,
the Stock Yards were taking on hundreds of Negro laborers to increase their
war-time production, and these new hands, most of them migration Negroes,
rode to and from work with white office workers. How the white office workers
felt about it is shown by a statement of a white woman clerk in the Stock
Yards:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Some of the Negroes on the Thirty-fifth Street car are very rough. Most of
them work out at the Stock Yards and the smell of the Yards is very bad. They seem
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
to try to clean up, but the smell is there, especially in cold weather when the cars
are closed. I would suggest that they run special cars from the Stock Yards for those
people, and that would leave enough cars for us and we wouldn't get the odor either.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This situation was somewhat remedied by the fact that most of the Negro
laborers at least changed their clothes before going home, even if they could
not entirely rid themselves of the Stock Yards odor; also the hours for Stock
Yards employees were so arranged that the office workers came to work later
and left later than the white and Negro laborers.
</p>

<p>
The Negro press of Chicago tried to make the migration Negro realize
how the odor attaching to his clothes was affecting public opinion. The
<i>Chicago Searchlight</i> of May 22, 1920, had this exhortation by the editor:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Did you ever get on the elevated train at Indiana Avenue about 5:30 o'clock
in the afternoon, and meet the "gang" from the Stock Yards? It would make you
ashamed to see men and women getting on the cars with greasy overalls on and
dirty dresses in this enlightened age. There is really no excuse for such a condition
to exist. There is plenty of soap and water in the Stock Yards and you have better
clothes in your homes. Why not take a suit to the yards and wash up and change
your clothing, before attempting to mingle with men and women, many of them
being dressed for theaters and club parties, etc.? Don't you know that you are forcing
on us here in Chicago a condition similar to the one down South?
</p>
</div>

<p>
In order to find out whether Negroes working in other plants than the
Stock Yards do work which leaves the worker soiled and smelling, superintendents
or foremen were questioned. It was learned that much other work
done by Negro laborers leaves oil, grease, and acid stains, that many of the
plants have no baths or adequate facilities for washing, and that sometimes
where there are such facilities they are not kept in order. Three-fourths of
the superintendents and foremen interviewed had the impression that Negroes
were more careful about bathing and changing their clothes than whites.
They said the difference was probably due either to the fact that the white
laborer who was doing the same class of work as the Negro, was an immigrant,
or to the fact that the white laborer often lived near the plant where
he works, and preferred to wash up at home.
</p>

<p>
The Negro laborer meets little objection when he is riding with white
laborers; it is when he comes in contact with whites of a non-laboring class
that there is the most likelihood of trouble. Such whites often find white
laborers quite as objectionable. A lawyer in Indiana Harbor who was questioned
about the transportation contacts in the Calumet industrial district,
said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
So far as transportation is concerned, little trouble need be expected. Most of
the people here are working people, and they know what to expect when a dirty
workman comes and sits down next to them. The fact of it is that if there is any
complaint to be made, it would be against the foreigners. In the winter, when the
doors are closed, the smell of garlic is almost unbearable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another complaint from whites is that Negroes on the street cars are
"rough." It is significant, however, that all the incidents related to the
Commission in regard to "roughness" occurred on crowded cars. The rush
to get on a car before or after working hours is often heavy. The Commission's
investigator, describing the loading of cars at an important transfer point
near the Stock Yards at the evening rush hour, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I observed the loading and transfers at Ashland and Forty-seventh from three
to four o'clock in the afternoon. With the possible exception of six to seven in the
morning the traffic is heaviest at this time. The transfers from the Ashland to the
Forty-seventh Street car are mostly Negroes from the government plants at Thirty-ninth
and Robey. About 40 per cent of them are women. Cars going east on Forty-seventh
Street leave every five minutes. There is a supervisor on this corner, whose
duty it apparently is to supervise the arrival and departure of cars. He pays no
attention, however, to the matter of loading. Usually the men meet the car in the
middle of the block and climb on while it is moving. By the time the car reaches the
corner the seats are all taken and the doorway is congested. The women, like the
men, get on as they can. No deference is shown them. Most of those who get on
this car are colored, and most of them, colored and white alike, are workmen.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Some friction between whites and Negroes has occurred during the boarding
of cars. It may be caused by general racial attitude as well as by the circumstances
of the particular case. The following cases were both related by white
men, one an assistant superintendent in a foundry, and the other a barber:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
One of our employees (Negro) in running to catch a car accidentally knocked
over a white man. The white man became particularly abusive, and the crowd
joined in with him. The crowd attempted to beat the Negro up, but he ran back to
the plant here for protection and we quieted them down.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I remember one time about three years ago, I was coming home on the Forty-seventh
Street car and two Negroes were standing on the back. It was pretty
crowded. A man swung his wife on board, and two more white men jumped on
too. He got her through into the car, and one of the Negroes said to her: "I'm
going to get that husband of yours." I went up and stood in back of the white man
and told him I'd stand by him, if anything happened. There were lots of whites on
the car but about half Negroes, I guess. I think the Negroes have too much freedom.
They don't know how to act. Some of those Negroes on the street car are real
uncivilized.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The South Side Elevated Company, in answer to a questionnaire said:
"It requires constant watching to prevent Negroes from entering and leaving
cars through the windows." The following incident, reported by the Commission's
investigator, who traveled over all the lines used by Negroes, shows
that both whites and Negroes may climb through the windows under the same
conditions of crowding:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I was transferring from the Argo car to the Sixty-third Street car with a number
of white and Negro workmen from the Corn Products Refining Company. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
crowd rushed for the door, and the doorway soon became congested. Two white
men climbed in the car through the back window, followed immediately by a Negro.
When the conductor came up, a white woman, who was standing next to me and had
seen the whole performance, said to the conductor, indicating the Negro, who had
climbed in through the window: "I wouldn't take his fare, if I were you. He came in
through the window."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Selection of seats by white and Negro passengers often provides instances
of conduct which is based on racial prejudices. These seem to be most frequent
on lines with comparatively light travel by Negroes and where there is thus less
opportunity for the races to become accustomed to contact. Sometimes
whites show plainly their avoidance of Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Some Negroes have timidly offered their seats to women standing, and have
been chagrined by the refusal of the white women to accept the courtesy.
The superintendent of one of the plants where Negroes work made the following
comment:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Negroes seemingly refrain from showing courtesy to white women, such as offering
them their seats, because of two facts. Either the woman to whom the courtesy
was extended, or outsiders, seem to the Negro to place a wrong construction upon his
courtesy. They think him either fresh or servile, and in the majority of cases where
a Negro would extend such courtesies, he refrains from doing so.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A few Negroes justified themselves by pointing out that white men did
not give up their seats for Negro women, and so they did not intend to give
up their seats for white women. The editor of a Negro newspaper took Negro
men to task for their disregard of white women and also women of their own
race, as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Do you know that there is a growing tendency among the young men of our race
to show disrespect for our womanhood? If you don't think so, just get on a street
car or visit public amusement places, or even notice their actions as they walk along
the street. It is nothing to see hundreds of big strong young men sitting on our cars,
while women stand until they become almost exhausted, while those "fellows" sit
and read their papers or gaze out of the car windows.
</p>

<p>
There is one trait, and I might say only one, that I take off my hat to the southern
"Cracker" for, and that is his respect and high regard for women. While he hasn't
any for the other fellow's [the Negro's] wives and daughters, yet he respects his own.
We must set a good example for him and respect all women, regardless of race, color,
or creed. Then you will win the admiration of all civilized people. Men who do
not respect and honor their women are not worthy of citizenship. Do you get me,
brother?
</p>
</div>

<p>
White men have become much incensed when they have given seats to
white women, and Negro men, not realizing what had happened, took the seats.
The timekeeper at a large industrial plant said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I was on an East Chicago Whiting car. Six Negro workmen were standing.
The car was full about one-third with Negroes. A man got up to let a white woman
sit down. A Negro, seeing the seat vacated, sat down before the woman had a chance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
to get to it. The man who had proffered the seat became indignant, cursed the Negro,
yanked him out of his seat, and proceeded to beat him up. The Negro drew out a
knife. About this time, it became a general race clash. One of the Negro workmen
had a gun: he pulled it out of his pocket and cleaned out the car.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The following incidents were reported by two white investigators:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I was on a Cottage Grove Avenue car at 5:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The car was crowded, about
one-third colored people. A young, well-dressed colored boy of about twenty was
standing in the aisle beside a white man and a white woman. The seat directly in
front of this colored boy was vacated, and the white man made a move to seize it,
but the boy by holding his arm on the back of the seat barred the white man's way
and stepped aside to allow the woman to sit down. The woman nodded her thanks
to the boy, and the white man went on reading his paper.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I was on an eastbound Oak Park elevated train at about 10:30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Several
Pullman porters got on at Campbell Avenue and had to stand, as did several white
women and men. As the crowd began to thin out, I noticed that the white men were
apt to drop into a vacant seat themselves, while the Negro porters were careful to
wait until the women sat down before they took advantage of any vacant seats.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A white woman in the Hyde Park district said to one of the investigators:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
On the street cars I would rather ride with Negro gentlemen than with many
of our so-called white gentlemen. A Negro man who has the slightest training is
courteous and genuinely so. My children use the street car every day to go to the
Hyde Park High School, and it's not the Negro men on the street cars I hate to think
of; it's the cheap white men. A very rough element of whites congregate every
night on Lake Park near Fifty-first Streetâ€”hoodlums that the colored people living
there must fear.
</p>
</div>

<p>
No case of attempted familiarity by a Negro man toward a white woman on
the street cars was reported to the Commission. Cases were reported, however,
of accidental contacts between Negro men and white women which might
easily have been misunderstood, but which seemed to the investigator, a
white woman, to be due to the clumsiness of southern rural Negroes in crowded
cars. Two such cases follow:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I was on a Madison car going west. A number of Negroes got on at the Northwestern
Station. The car was crowded, and I felt someone in the aisle leaning
heavily against my shoulder. I was very much annoyed and glanced up. I saw
that the man was a Negro about twenty years old. He was with a girl, obviously
his sister, who was also standing in the aisle. They both had childlike faces, and
I could see that he was quite unaware that he was leaning against me. I didn't
say anything, as the car was really crowded.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I was in the aisle seat of an Illinois Central suburban car about 5:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, waiting
for the train to start. A Negro man standing in the aisle next to me suddenly leaned
against my shoulder so hard that it hurt. I looked up at him resentfully but he
didn't notice me. He looked as though he had been picked up in a little western
town and dumped down in a city for the first time. He had a wide western hat on,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
and his face was lean and weatherbeaten. I take it he was about fifty years old.
He was in animated conversation with a woman in a seat behind me. This woman
had many bundles. Apparently they wanted to find seats together. Soon another
man joined them who had been scouting for seats in the car ahead, and they all set
out together for another car. They were so concentrated on this problem of getting
a seat that they didn't know there was anyone else in the car. They lunged down
the aisle knocking against people as they went along, but no one paid any particular
attention to them.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another case of accidental contact, showing an attitude of suspicion on
the part of a white woman, was reported by a Negro Y.M.C.A. secretary:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I was on a street car going west through the "Loop" on Madison Street. A
colored man, apparently a workman, was sitting across the aisle from me, looking
out of the window, with his left arm stretched along the back of the seat. A white
woman came in, glanced at the vacant seat beside me, and sat down beside the
colored man across the aisle. He looked around and saw the woman sitting in the
seat, and apparently was confused. He attempted to remove his arm, and in doing
so his arm brushed across the woman's shoulder. She got right up and exclaimed:
"How dare you put your arm around me?" The man looked at her dumbly, his
face the picture of excitement and wonder. I said to the lady, "I was watching this
man and he was honestly trying to remove his arm from the back of the seat. I
think he was more surprised to find you there than anything else, and the whole thing
was sheer accident." She wanted to know what I had to do with it, and I simply said
I wouldn't like to see a matter of that kind misunderstood. She resumed her seat
beside the colored man and nothing further happened.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Many cases of improper advances by white men toward Negro women
were reported to the Commission by Negro women, well known to the Commission,
whose character is beyond question. The following are typical:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Going south on a State Street car to Fifty-third Street, I noticed a man in the
aisle staring at me. He kept moving down nearer and nearer to my seat and sat
down in front of me. He handed me a note written on a scrap of newspaper. I
opened it because I was curious to know what his motive was. He was a young man,
in his twenties, and well dressed. He had written down his name and telephone
number and the words: "Call me for a date."
</p>

<p class="p2">
I remember one man especially, because I used to ride downtown on the same car
he took every morning. The first time I ever saw him, he stared at me a great deal
and when I got off the car, he got off too. As he got off he said to me, "Don't take
that car, wait for the other one." I noticed then that he went over to the corner and
took a car going in the opposite direction from mine. I saw him lots of times after
that, and he always got just as close as he could and stared. I always arranged it so
that he could not sit next to me.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I was on the elevated with a friend the other day. We were sitting on end seats.
A man got up to give a white woman his seat and then came over and stood close
to us. He stood with his legs against my friend's knees, until she jerked around
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
and sat facing me. Then he tried standing close to me. He had me so hedged in
I could hardly move, and I had to make a very abrupt movement to get away. He
moved on after a while.
</p>
</div>

<p>
What may be done to prevent misunderstanding and check in its incipiency
trouble which might easily and suddenly become serious, is illustrated in the
action of a white woman, a resident of the Chicago Commons Social Settlement:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
One evening, soon after the race riot in July, 1919, I was riding on a State Street
car, going south from Grand Avenue. I had only ridden a block, when there was a
general stir in the car, a young woman fainted, and I learned that the conductor had
been struck and his cap knocked off. Word went around the car that a "nigger"
did it. Ugly remarks were being made and I feared there would be trouble. I
stepped to the back of the car and asked two colored women if they knew who struck
the conductor. One said, "He looked like a colored man," the other said, "I don't
know." Then I asked the conductor, in a voice loud enough so that the rest of the car
could hear me, whether it was a white or a black man that struck him and why.
He said: "It was a white man. I wouldn't let him bring his big drum on the platform,
it was too crowded." Having learned this, I turned to two young couples who were
still showing much feeling and said, "A white man struck the conductor." The whole
car then quieted down, and there was no more feeling.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Most of the difficulties in transportation contacts reported and generally
complained of seem to have centered around the first blundering efforts of
migrants to adjust themselves to northern city life. The efforts of agencies
interested in assisting this adjustment, together with the Negro press, and the
intimate criticisms and suggestion for proper conduct of Chicago Negroes,
have smoothed down many of the roughnesses of the migrants, and as a result
friction from contact in transportation seems to have lessened materially.
</p>

<h3>
E. CONTACTS IN OTHER RELATIONS
</h3>

<p>
Here are included:
</p>

<p>
I. Contacts in public places, such as restaurants, department stores,
theaters, and personal-service places.
</p>

<p>
II. "Black and tan" resorts, which present a much-criticized association
because of the vicious elements of whites and Negroes in contact there.
</p>

<p>
III. Cultural contacts which indicate associations on a purely intellectual
basis.
</p>

<p>
IV. Contacts in co-operative efforts for race betterment, which includes
most of the social organizations working among Negroes.
</p>

<h4>
I. CONTACTS IN PUBLIC PLACES
</h4>

<p>
On the street, in public conveyances, stores, restaurants, and commercial
places of amusement, contacts of races and nationalities are unavoidable
and have not the supervision that is common in schools or even public amusement
places.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Where large numbers of Negroes live there are theaters, restaurants,
stores, barber shops, and personal-service places, which are used by Negroes
in the proportion in which they predominate in the population of the area.
In any or all of these places, however, white persons are served.
</p>

<p>
The business district along State Street between Twenty-sixth and Forty-seventh,
and on the car-line cross-streets, is maintained partly by, and largely
for, the Negro residents in the general neighborhood. Since, however, about
50 per cent of the population is white, there are personal-service places which
are used almost exclusively by whites. Barber shops are wholly exclusive,
and several restaurants attempt to make themselves so. For example:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
At Thirty-first Street and Indiana Avenue, in the heart of the Negro residence
area, a restaurant proprietor maintains an L-shaped establishment. Fronting on
Thirty-first Street is a neatly arranged and well-kept dining-room, with tables for
ladies, and a lunch counter with white waiters. Fronting on Indiana Avenue is a
narrow, dark dining-room, with a counter served by colored waitresses. It is not
kept neatly, and is not so well supplied. Both dining-rooms are served from the
kitchen in the corner of the L, and patrons in either dining-room would never suspect
that there were two dining-rooms with connection through this kitchen. At the time
of the investigation, the dining-rooms had different names.
</p>

<p>
Negroes entering the Indiana Avenue dining-room are given prompt service.
If they enter the Thirty-first Street room they are given indifferent service, are required
to wait long and the service given them is reluctant and discourteous.
</p>

<p>
At another restaurant in the same neighborhood, similar means are used to discourage
Negro patronage. Sometimes in addition to long waiting and discourtesy,
food is spoiled. For example, egg shells are placed in egg orders, and salt is poured
into the food.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the districts where whites predominate, the measures taken to exclude
Negroes are very definite. In a lunchroom near Forty-third Street and
Vincennes Avenue, a well-educated, well-appearing young Negro had the
following experience:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I went into the restaurant about two o'clock June 13, and sat about four seats
from the front at a counter. After about ten minutes the waiter came and asked me
to move to a seat at the rear of the counter. I asked him why and he told me he could
not serve me where I was sitting. He said the management reserved the right to
seat its guests, and pointed to a sign on the wall bearing that notice. I asked him if
he could not serve me just as well where I was sitting as on the rear counter. He
said maybe he could, but it was a rule of the house not to, and he would not. I left
without being served.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another Negro experience in a lunchroom on Forty-third Street near the
Elevated is thus described: "Service given was very poor. When protest
was made, the police were called and the young man was arrested for disorderly
conduct. The case was dismissed."
</p>

<p>
Fifty-ninth and Halsted streets: "Service refused in a Swedish cafÃ©. No
witnesses."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Near Berwyn and Broadway (North Side): "Service refused, and investigator
ordered out."
</p>

<p>
In the "Loop," experiences are widely varied. In all of the following cases,
carefully selected investigators were sent and asked to report in detail what
happened. It is possible to gather large numbers of personal experiences,
from any group of Negroes, but as the facts cannot be verified they have not
been used. These instances usually go unnoticed by all but the participants,
except where the parties offended may secure witnesses among the guests
present, which is difficult.
</p>

<p>
At a large, popular, general restaurant on Randolph Street, two women
investigators had this typical experience showing how a manager can refuse
service, and still attempt to keep within the law:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Entered about 7:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The restaurant was well filled; I counted only six
vacant tables. A woman head waitress took us through the main dining-room to
the annex, where another head waitress preceded us down the length of the room to
a corner table in the rear. There was a vacant table on either side of us. We waited
almost a half hour, with no attention, until a couple was seated at the next table.
When the waitress brought water to them she also brought water to us. She took
the orders for both tables. Mrs. Hâ€”â€” ordered steak, salad and tea. I ordered
chicken salad and tea. Steak and potatoes were served to the next table in about
ten minutes. The waitress came to me and said the chef said he was out of chicken.
I ordered steak. After another long period of waiting, she came back and said,
"The chef says he is out of small steaks." I asked, "What have you?" She said
she would go and see. She did not return, but after about fifteen minutes a man came
to our table, put his hands on it, leaned down and said, "Do you want to see me?"
Although I suspected he was the manager, he had not said so, and I replied, "Who
are you? I don't know anything about you. No, we don't want to see you."
He then said, "I am the manager. What do you want?" "I came to be served with
dinner." He replied, "We have nothing to serve you." I asked, "Why, what is
the reason?" He replied "There is no reason; we haven't anything to serve you."
He was evidently cautious to keep within the letter of the law, but was determined
that we should not be served. He would give no reason, simply repeating his former
statement. We left without further discussion, and without being served.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tâ€”â€” says the waitress was courteous, and evidently regretful of the embarrassment
of repeated refusal to serve. None of the patrons sitting near made any
protest at their presence. It has been her experience that patrons, waitresses, ushers
in theaters rarely show any hesitancy in accepting the presence of colored people who
are orderly and self-respecting. Almost invariably the disagreeable incidents happen
through the management, or through the carrying out of orders.
</p>
</div>

<p>
An interview with the manager of this restaurant was willingly given to
a white investigator who later visited the place, and questions were answered
freely and carefully. He said he had a number of Negro friends and appreciated
the differences in them, as he did in whites. The main points in a long discussion
of restaurant management in general, and the particular problem with
reference to serving Negroes, he summed up as follows:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In the past five years, only one Negro has been served in this restaurant. She
came in with a southern family as maid to a small child. The family was told that
she could be served at a table with them, or in a side room, but could not be served
at an adjoining table, even with the child. After some discussion, the maid ate at
one end of a long table with the child, while the family sat at the other end.
</p>

<p>
At the time of the recent instance, when the two Negro women came in, the
manager was not in the restaurant. From what he was told of the incident, he
thinks he should have asked them to come to the office, and explained the situation
to them. He had no doubt they would have understood, as he has always found
intelligent Negroes readily responsive to the things which might be injurious to their
relations with whites.
</p>

<p>
Before he was manager, a man brought in two Negroes, seemingly to get a basis
for a suit and damages. The manager offered to serve them in a side room, but
refused service in the main dining-room. They left without being served, and nothing
further was heard from them.
</p>

<p>
In former years he had seen dishes broken in the presence of Negroes after being
used in high-grade restaurants where their patronage was not wanted.
</p>

<p>
Barring Negroes was not personal, he said. A successful restaurant must watch
closely the desires of its patrons, and not allow anything to interfere with smooth
running. Complaints are made after each appearance of Negroes. He did not know
what he would do if Negroes insisted on being served, but was firm that no Negro
could be served in the main dining-rooms. He would vary procedure to suit the
circumstances.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The following case, illustrative of the witnesses and testimony necessary
to a court decision, was tried before Judge Adams, and damages of $100 with
costs were awarded:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In August, 1920, Miss Lillian Beale, Negro secretary to Miss Amelia Sears,
white, superintendent of the United Charities, went as the guest of her employer
to a candy shop and lunch room on Michigan Avenue. They seated themselves and
remained for two hours without service. During this time several friends of Miss
Sears came in, were served and left, all of them commenting on the apparently deliberate
oversight of the party. They remained for some time and left. Suit was
brought against the company, supported by Miss Sears and her friends. At the first
hearing it was stated that the waitress was ill at a hospital in Cincinnati. The
judge, however, was insistent, and she was produced. When placed on the stand
she admitted, contrary to the expectations of the management, that she had been
ordered by the management not to serve any colored persons at any time. Miss
Beale was awarded and collected damages of $100 and costs.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Eight months later, in July, 1921, a test was made of the same restaurant.
Two Negro women went together to the restaurant, and a white woman
observer went along to watch what might happen. Their reports agree and
are as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Time, one o'clock. Restaurant 50 per cent filled. Mrs. Lâ€”â€” and Mrs. Sâ€”â€”
came in and seated themselves at a table for two near the center of the room. Waitress
followed usual routine of bringing water, taking order, etc. Service of a table d'hÃ´te
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
luncheon was prompt and courteous. No inattention was observed, nor any disturbance
on part of neighbors. Two white women came in and seated themselves
at the next table, though there were several others vacant.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Two other Negro women and a white observer were sent to another restaurant
operating under the same firm name. It was reported by the white
observer as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Restaurant two thirds filledâ€”12 o'clock. Mostly women patrons, though a
fair number of men alone, and of couples use this restaurant. Mrs. Tâ€”â€” and her
friend came in through the long passage by the candy counter, and crossed to a table
for two in the middle of the room. The manager, who is a young woman of considerable
poise and ability, came at once and gave them water, took their order, and later
served them. Two young white women at an adjoining table moved, but it may have
been because they were sitting with strangers and preferred a table for two. After
finishing my lunch, I joined Mrs. Tâ€”â€” and her friend, and the manager kept us
under observation, but nothing was said.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In a subsequent interview with the manager at the general office of this
chain of tea rooms cautiously worded replies were made to questions, with
constant reiteration of the statement, "But you know we must serve them."
In general it was said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Negro patrons are infrequent, and there has been no noticeable increase. After
many cases, complaint is made by white patrons, either in person or by letter, to
the effect that if the tea room caters to Negroes, the white patrons will no longer use
it. They had never known of a case of objectionable conduct but whites simply
objected to their presence.
</p>

<p>
No instructions were given waitresses, but each case was handled by the head
waitress as it occurred. Some girls made no objections to waiting on Negroes, and
some refused to do it, but each attitude is individual, and not from instructions.
No question that Negro patronage would hurt any high-grade place, as white patrons
would be likely to leave. Rights did not enter into the problemâ€”simply a matter
of profitable business.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Interviews with managers of tea rooms in department stores brought out
uniformity of attitude and of practice, as is shown in the following reports:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The manager of one tea room is a young woman of considerable experience.
She was emphatic in saying that Negroes were not wanted, and that every effort
would be made to discourage their coming. Considerable personal feeling was
manifested in her statements.
</p>

<p>
Not enough Negroes can afford to pay the prices in high-grade restaurants to
make them a real problem, and stray cases are handled as they appear. The effort
was made to make them feel uncomfortable so they would not return. Slow service,
indifferent attention were given, but there was no overcharging, and no spoiling of
food.
</p>

<p>
Had never observed any objectionable conduct. Objections of white patrons
was only reason. Especially difficult in summer, when many southern white people
come to Chicago as a summer resort.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Waitresses are largely young married women with spare time. Manager finds
them more unwilling than regular waitresses to give service to Negroes.
</p>
</div>

<p>
At another tea room practically the same statements were made, and the
following instance was given: "Last winter a telephone reservation was made
for a large luncheon partyâ€”about forty. When the group arrived, it was a
club of colored women. Screens were placed around the tables, and luncheon
served. A rule was then made and enforced that no telephone reservations
would be made."
</p>

<p>
Following are reports from investigators seeking to learn at which restaurants,
tea rooms, and lunch counters, service would be given to Negroes:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We had been shopping down town, and went into â€”â€”'s on State Street to get
a light lunch. There were vacant tables and we sat down. No one came to wait
on us. After waiting until several persons who had come in after us had been served,
I went to one of the men who appeared to be the manager, and asked him why we
were not served. He did not respond very cordially, but sent a girl. We ordered
several dishes from the card, and were told that they were "just out." Although orders
were being served, the girl stated that they were "just out" of everything we ordered.
To cover our embarrassment, we practically begged her to serve us cups of chocolate.
She gave us the chocolate and our check; we paid it and left.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Mrs. Tâ€”â€” and Mrs. â€” were served promptly and without incident in a well-known
candy store in the shopping district on State Street. Mrs. Tâ€”â€” says that
for many years this place has been known for its courtesy to colored people. Soon
after it was opened, about World's Fair year, Mrs. â€”â€”, a Negro woman, was refused
service by a waitress. She reported the fact to the owner, who investigated, and finding
her statement correct, discharged the waitress. He made the rule that every
patron was entitled to prompt, courteous service, and that discharge would follow
any justified complaint. Although the store has been under other management
for many years, later adding light luncheons to candy and soft drinks, the tradition
has continued. Mrs. Tâ€”â€” says neither waitress nor patrons paid any attention
to the serving of two colored women.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This case, involving three races, was reported from one of the Chinese
restaurants on South Wabash Avenue:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
About 7:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we entered a Chinese restaurant. There were three or four white
couples eating in the main dining-room, and two in booths. A Japanese waiter
ushered us toward the furthest booth at the rear of the room. "I prefer sitting in
the main dining-room," I said. He replied, "I can't serve you here." "Why?"
"These seats are reserved. I will serve you in there [pointing to the booth] but not
out here." We left.
</p>
</div>

<p>
One of the largest chains of cafeterias in Chicago is noted for the fairness
of its treatment of Negroes, but even here there are exceptions. One of the
Commission's staff observed two incidents within a short time in the same
cafeteria of this system and reported them as follows:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Just in line before me was a small, quiet, well-dressed colored woman. She passed
the checker, carried her tray to an unoccupied table, and then counted her check.
She took her tray back to the checker, and made complaint of overcharge. The
checker did not recount, or explain, simply saying, "That is our price." The woman
went back to her table, ate, paid, and went out without further protest.
</p>

<p>
A few nights later, I noticed two young, well-mannered colored girls at a nearby
table. As I went out I met the manager and said to him, "Do many Negroes come
here to eat?" He said, "No, occasionally they come in, but they don't come back
more than once, or at most twice." "How do you manage it?" "Well, under the law,
we can't refuse to let them eat, but we can charge them any price we like. The first
time we charge them enough to keep them from coming back. Then if they persist
and come again, as soon as they go down the line, I see to it that something is put in
their food which makes it taste badâ€”salt or Epsom salts. They never come back
after that." After a pause he added, "You know we are within the law. We can't
have them coming hereâ€”it would ruin our trade."
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the inexpensive restaurants on the edge of the "Loop," various practices
are followed, as indicated by the following reports:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Miss B. S. met a friend and went into the â€”â€” Cafeteria on Lake Street, near
State, upstairs. They were served, but the waiter put screens around their table
while they were eating.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In May, 1921, I went to a lunchroom on Van Buren Street to get a lunch at noon.
Six or seven men were at the counter, and were served as fast as they came in. Finally
all seats were filled and three waiters were doing nothing, so I asked to be served.
The waiter pretended not to hear me, then said roughly, "What do you want?"
I said, "I do not know until I get a bill of fare." He pitched it at me and I asked for
some baked beans. He stuck his head through the chef's window and gave my
order. He brought me a plate on which were fourteen beans, and one small roll.
I asked for a glass of water and he brought me a half-glass. I asked for butter
(which had been served with two rolls to white patrons) and he said it would cost
me a nickel. He said with emphasis, "It will cost <i>you</i> a nickel." I said, "You give me
the butter, and then watch me and see if I pay for it." I asked for some pie and he
gave me a piece about half the size he was serving the others. Then he said again,
"Remember that butter will cost you a nickel extra." I said, "I won't pay it." He
said, "You will pay for that dinner before you eat a bite of it." I said, "No chance,
because I am not going to pay you at all, either before or after I eat. After I have
finished I will pay the cashier at the desk." He looked at me hard and I kept on eating.
Then he threw me down a check for 25 cents. I said, "Brother, you are
wrong. My bill is only 20 cents. Your menu says beans are 15 cents and pie is
5 cents, and you gave me only one roll when to all of the others you served two."
He said again, "I told you your butter would cost you a nickel." I said, "Now, you
watch me right close when I go out and see if I pay for it." I told the cashier that
my check called for 25 cents when it should be 20, "beans 15, pie 5, and if you can make
25 out of that all right." She said, "You know I have to collect what the check calls
for, or else make good myself." I told her I appreciated her position but would not pay
25 cents for a 20-cent lunch. Then my waiter stepped up with an iron tap in his hand,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
and said, "I told you that butter would cost you a nickel, and now you pay it or elseâ€”â€”."
I said, I will "else," and laid down twenty cents and walked out. At the door
he gave me a push but did not strike me.
</p>

<p>
The white proprietor of a drug-store in a residence neighborhood volunteered
this story to a member of the Commission's staff:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Several years ago, there was a fine old colored man who used to come in frequently
to buy drugs, supplies, etc. One day he came in with his wife, sat down at one of the
little tables, and asked for soda water. My clerk refused to serve them, and the
idea occurred to me that I would serve them myself in such a way that there would
be no possibility that they would ever come back. I compounded a vile concoction
and served it to them. They tasted it, paid for it, thanked me, and went out without
making any complaint. I have never got over feeling mean about it. I not only
humiliated them, and insulted them, but I cheated them out of their money.
</p>
</div>

<p>
An instance of unusual absence of friction in contacts under conditions
which might be expected to produce it was given by a white woman who visited
a restaurant patronized by many whites and Negroes:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In talking with Mr. Oâ€”â€” he asked me, "Would you consider it possible that
you would voluntarily go into a restaurant and eat your lunch where you might
have a Negro sitting on the next stool, or perhaps one on either side of you at a table?"
I answered promptly, "No, I can't imagine it." He said, "A year ago I wouldn't
have imagined such a thing possible myself, but now I do it quite frequently. There
is a restaurant across the street from my office, right here in the heart of the Negro
district, which a few years ago was a very good one, with regular table service, excellent
food, and all the rest. Last year it was changed into a sort of a cafeteria, with a lunch
counter down one side, and some tables. You get your knife and fork, go to the
serving counter, and a man gives you on a plate whatever you order. The other day
I found myself between two colored men, and took a good look at the restaurant.
There is absolutely no disturbance, or even consciousness of any reason for disturbance."
</p>

<p>
Today I decided I would try it myself. The restaurant has no frills; it is simply
an eating-place. I chose a corner seat at a table, because I could see all over the room.
As I sat down, a courteous arm reached across the table to shove back the used dishes.
I looked up to say "thank you," and found a good-looking young colored man
opposite. No further attention was paid to me, nor was there any consciousness
in his face, other than courtesy. In a few minutes, two young white truck drivers
took the other places at my table. They were in working jeans, and except that the
color was blue instead of khaki, looked just like the young soldiers in transport service
who used to come into my canteen in France. At the next table was a quietly dressed
young colored girl eating her lunch in a business-like way. A young white father
brought in his little daughter. At the long lunch counter were neighborhood business
men, white and colored, some professional men, each taking whatever stool happened
to be vacant. Occasionally a truck driver or roughly dressed working man came in.
Even the white dandy, immaculate in linen and with a cane hooked over his arm,
took his cup of coffee to the counter and sat between a laborer and a business man.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
In theaters, as in restaurants, there are petty evasions of the law, disagreeable
encounters, and small but insistent snobberies. A colored investigator
reported the result of a test of the purchase of tickets for a play which had
had a long run, as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
On July 5 I went down to the â€”â€” theater and asked the ticket seller if I could
get two seats for Thursday or Friday night between the third and ninth rows, center.
She hunted out two seats in the ninth row for Thursday. I said, "If you have them
I would prefer them for Friday." I asked the price, paid her, and she thanked me.
</p>

<p>
Friday, I went to the theater, and handed the doorman my tickets. He tore off
the coupons, and directed me to the main-floor door. The lady usher seated us three
rows from the back on the aisle. I counted and found that I was in the seventeenth
row. I went to the usher and said, "I beg your pardon, but you seated me in the
wrong place." She took the coupons, said, "Wait a second," and started out with
them. I followed to see that she did not exchange my coupons. She went to the
lobby and talked with the manager. He looked at me and said, "Well, seat them;
there is nothing else to do now." She went back, gave my coupons to another usher,
who asked her if I was to be seated in the seats the coupons called for. She answered,
"I guess so." Then we were shown to the correct seats. There was no protest from
those around us.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The manager of this theater was later interviewed. He had been in Chicago
only a few months and was not at all interested in the general question of
race relations, but was decided in his opinion that the attendance of Negroes
in any high-class theater was not desirable. His views were about as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Not many Negroes buy seats down stairs. Usually the ticket seller gives them
tickets in the balcony or gallery and on the side aisles. Usually had complaints
from white patrons if they found a Negro seated near them, especially if there were
ladies in the party. It was not that the conduct of the Negroes was objectionable,
but their mere presence was objectionable. If Negroes present tickets for the best
main-floor seats, ushers try to put them in less conspicuous places. If they insist
on taking their seats as shown on tickets, nothing can be done. If white patrons
object, every effort is made to change their seats. Usual objection is offensive odor
and proximity.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In making the study of theaters, certain tests were established. A Negro
would ask at the box-office for seats on the main floor within certain rows
and on the aisle. In the preceding report it will be noted that seats were sold
readily, but some difficulty was found in using them. In the next report,
conditions were reversed:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Mr. Jâ€”â€”, Negro, asked for tickets, and was told that there was nothing on the
main floor further in front than the twenty-third row. Miss Hâ€”â€”, white, who was
standing by him as he made the request, and heard the answer, moved up to the window
and was immediately and without any remark, sold tickets in the seventeenth
row on the aisle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
These tickets were presented by Mr. and Mrs. Sâ€”â€”, Negroes. They report:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We arrived at 8:15, five minutes before the opening of the performance. The
ticket taker tore off our stubs and returned them to us without any hesitancy. The
ushers, who were women, glanced at the seat numbers and directed us to our seats,
which were in a very conspicuous location on the first floor. They were in the seventeenth
row, on the aisle. The people around us, even the ones immediately next to
us, were not in the least concerned at our presence. The treatment accorded us in
general could not have been surpassed.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A different report comes from another "Loop" theater, which has always
been rather conservative in the standard of plays which it presents:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My husband and I wished to see a play at â€”â€” Theater, and bought seats several
days in advance that we might have a choice. When we were shown to our seats,
however, we were surprised to find that our tickets called for seats in the gallery,
and in a corner which did not afford a view, and made them more than undesirable.
We noticed that there were several vacant seats in the balcony, also on the first floor.
My husband went to the box office and tried to exchange the seats. The ticket
seller refused to make the exchange and also became insulting in his remarks to us.
Afterwards we made the attempt to secure seats on the first floor of this same theater
several days in advance of the performance which we wished to attend. We were
told there were no seats on the first floor which we could get.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A contrasting experience follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
On Tuesday I went to the â€”â€” Theater, and applied for two tickets on the main
floor, center aisle, between the third and eleventh rows. The ticket seller stated
politely that he had two tickets in the ninth row on the left. When we attended
the performance, nothing unusual occurred. Other patrons made no comment,
and in no way could we observe any objection made to our presence. There were
no other Negroes at the performance.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Reports of investigators indicate that the managers of movies are convinced
that their main floors, at least, should be guarded against Negroes. In most
of the commercial amusement places, Negroes seldom have difficulty if they
are willing to sit in the balcony, though attempts are frequently made to seat
them on the aisles next to the walls, even when there are center seats empty.
It is rare that any report is obtained of objections by white patrons to the
actual presence of Negroes when they are well-mannered, well-dressed, and
appreciative auditors.
</p>

<p>
As a rule movie theaters do not sell reserved seats, general admission
entitling any patron to any seat in the house. But the following detailed
report of the experience of two intelligent, well-dressed, quiet-mannered Negro
women at a new movie theater on State Street is typical:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Purchased tickets, and entered the large lobby which extends across the front of
the house. From this lobby there are closed doors at the entrance of several aisles,
so that patrons are directed by ushers to different aisles, supposedly wherever there
are vacant seats. We followed directions, and went to the extreme left of the lobby.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
We opened the door, and the usher in charge of this aisle started down toward the
front to show us seats. We saw at once that the narrow section of seats next to the
wall was empty except for one colored woman sitting about the middle of the section.
Instead of following the usher down the aisle, and taking seats indicated to the right
of this section, we turned through a row of empty seats on the left-hand section, and
sat next to a woman in the aisle seat. This put us two rows from the rear in a side
middle section, instead of in the section which seemed to be reserved for colored
patrons, next to the wall. As the usher returned to his station he said, "We have
some lovely seats in the balcony; wouldn't you prefer sitting there?" He was courteous,
and I thanked him, telling him that we were quite satisfied with the seats we
had taken.
</p>

<p>
Later, seeing two vacant seats further front in the center section which gave
us a much better view we decided to take them and see what would happen. As we
rose, the usher tried to block us by putting his hands on the back of the seat in front,
and saying, "I am sorry that you can't take those seats." I brushed by him and took
one of the seats. He tried the same thing with Mrs. Hâ€”â€”, and she also brushed by
and joined me. There were scattered vacant seats both in the section we left and the
one to which we moved. We remained until the end of the show without embarrassment.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The manager of this theater has had many years of experience in Chicago,
and was quite willing to discuss race contacts. Nothing in his words would
indicate any strong prejudice against Negroes, even when expressing his
conviction that they should keep to places intended especially for them. He
said, in substance:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Not many Negroes buy ticketsâ€”perhaps ten or a dozen a day. An effort is
made to seat them in one section of the house, preferably the balcony, to which they
are directed by ushers. Reason is the complaint by white patrons who object to
sitting next to them for an hour, or hour and a half. Offensive odor reason usually
given. White patrons often complain to manager as they go out if Negro has been
sitting near them.
</p>

<p>
Conduct of Negroes is not often objectionableâ€”runs about the same as all patrons.
Occasionally one tries to "start something." Recently two Negroes came to manager
in crowded lobby after they had attended the show and objected to their seats on
the balcony to which they had been sent by ushers, saying there were vacant seats
on the main floor. Wanted to know why they were discriminated against. Manager
did not want an argument in the presence of other patrons, and told them that as
they had seen the show, heard the music, and shared everything with other patrons,
he did not see they had any real cause for complaint. Called attention to the notice
printed on almost every theater ticket in some form or other to the effect that the
management reserves the right to revoke the license granted in the sale of the ticket,
by refunding the money paid.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The same two women bought tickets the next day and attended a movie
in an older and very popular "Loop" theater. They reported that they had no
difficulty of any kind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On a test made of a new and popular movie theater in an outlying section
the investigator reported:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There were four of us in the party on June 5. We were told by the usher that
there were no seats on the first floor, and that we would find seats in the first balcony.
I think he was right, for there were white people also sent to the balcony. We were
ushered in promptly, but another usher met us and said, "Right on up to the second
balcony." We said we preferred seats in the first balcony, and walked by him.
He went and got two more ushers and stood in front of us to prevent us from going
into the first balcony, insisting that there were no seats there. One of the young
ladies stepped around the usher, and saw three vacant seats. She called them to
the attention of the usher, and he then said he meant there were no seats for four.
Two of our party took those seats, and the other two waited about twenty minutes
till they could get the seats they wanted. After getting into the first balcony, we
saw vacant seats in at least four rows, two, three, and four seats together into which
we might quietly have gone had the usher been courteous.
</p>
</div>

<p>
On June 18, 1920, a well-known Negro employed in the City Hall was
denied admission to a movie theater at Halsted and Sixty-third streets. There
is a small but long-established Negro colony about a mile west of this location.
</p>

<p>
In business places of various kinds, contacts are determined largely by
the kind of service offered. Department-store managers questioned by
investigators concerning their Negro patronage and the use of Negro girls as
clerks, stated that the public had definite preferences, and probably would
not willingly tolerate Negroes either as patrons or as clerks. In stores selling
general merchandise, courteous treatment is, as a rule, accorded to Negro
patrons, although there are occasional annoying incidents. The attitude
then taken is determined by the standing and influence of the Negroes discriminated
against. For instance:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
At one of the largest department stores, two Negro women, both school teachers,
were refused service in the basement shoe department. The clerks refused to fit
shoes for them. A Negro alderman became interested in this case, and because of
refusal of service, canceled his account.
</p>

<p>
The wife of a prominent Negro attorney went into a State Street candy store
and was flatly refused service. Her husband brought suit and got damages.
</p>

<p>
Miss Vâ€”â€” was refused service at a large State Street department store by one
of the clerks. The manager was interviewed and the clerk reprimanded and transferred.
On the second visit, Miss Vâ€”â€” received attention.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In residence areas which are largely white, certain stores practice a peculiar
subversion of the law in the effort to regulate contacts. A Negro resident of
Woodlawn stated that his seven-year-old daughter had gone to the store to
purchase goods for a costume to wear at a school entertainment. She was
given material for which she had not asked, which she did not want, and for
which she was overcharged. Frightened at the manners of the clerk, she took
it. When it was returned, the clerk was extremely abusive, and told her that
colored people were not wanted in the store. The little girl had, according
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'>321</a></span>
to her parents, made a mistake in entering the store. Her parents were
acquainted with the attitude of the management and avoided the place.
In the following reports, there is evident the sense of injustice felt by both
whites and Negroes concerned in the contacts:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Miss S. Tâ€”â€” wrote a prominent musical college and made arrangements for
taking the summer normal-training courses. Her tuition fee was accepted, and the
classes arranged. On her arrival, the manager received the balance of her money
for the entire course, but told her the classes she wanted were full, and she would have
to take private lessons with another teacher. The teacher of the desired classes
told her the manager had not been frank, and that he feared the objection of southern
white girls in the classes. Miss Tâ€”â€” made repeated attempts to get into the classes,
but each time was told to apply again. This she did until it was too late to catch
up with her back work. Other pupils were given prompt admission to the classes.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Two investigators were instructed to go to a public restroom in a large
office building on State Street where there are many small shops selling women's
wearing apparel. Their experience follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
On July 6, at one <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> with Mrs. Hâ€”â€”, I visited the public restroom in the â€”â€”
building. It is on the eleventh floor, on the main hall, and the door to the suite
of rooms stood open. On one side of the entrance hall there is a small room used
for a shoe-shining, with a Negro in attendance. Next on the same side is a large
lavatory. Facing the outside door is the entrance to the restroom proper, which is
large enough for ten or fifteen women, and is fitted up with wicker chairs, lounge,
table, etc.
</p>

<p>
As we were about to enter the restroom, the woman in charge stood with her arm
across the door, and said, "You are not to go in there; you may go into the lavatory."
We asked why, and she said, "Those are the orders of the office." We went into
the restroom, and she did not offer any opposition, but a little later came to us and
said, "You are not allowed in here. You will have to see the manager."
</p>

<p>
I asked the attendant for the manager's name and room number, which she gave
me. I related the incident to him. He told me that the attendant had informed
me correctly, that the eleventh-floor restroom was reserved for "white folks" and that
"colored folks" were not allowed to use it. They could use a restroom on the nineteenth
floor set aside for colored employees of the building, and for any "colored
folks" who might come into the building. He said it was one of the "iron-clad rules
of the man who owned the building," and that "the attendant had it down in black
and white."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Difficulties of this sort which confront Negroes and the efforts by Negroes
to share equal treatment in public accommodations as well as the experiences
met with when cases reach the courts were commented upon by Judge Cook,
of the municipal court, in testimony before the Commission. He said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
During the earlier part of 1918 I sat in what was known as the criminal jury
branch. That is the branch to which were assigned all criminal cases in the municipal
court where the defendants demanded a trial by jury and were not tried at the police
station. Among them were cases involving violations of what is known as the
civil-rights law, where a colored man had a druggist or the proprietor of a moving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
picture or legitimate theater arrested for refusing to serve him soda water or refreshments
at the drug store or to furnish him admission by ticket at a movie or legitimate
theater, or if he did furnish him admission by selling him a ticket, limiting the ticket
which he would sell to some undesirable portion of the house or to the gallery and not
to the main floor, claiming that the theater was crowded downstairs and that there
were no seats.
</p>

<p>
I suppose I tried during the early part of 1918 and the summer of 1919 probably
a half-dozen of those civil-rights cases. In every one of them that I tried, there was
virtually a clear case against the defendant. The jury in every instance was practically
a white jury, or may have had one or two colored men. Notwithstanding that
I gave very positive and clear instructions as to what the law wasâ€”to wit, that they
were entitled to equal rights and privileges in public places and that if the jury believed
from the evidence that the plaintiff was not accorded such right, there was a violation
of the law and the defendant should be punished, and after elaborate argument by
counsel for both the prosecution and the defendant (and by parenthesis I may say
in all of these cases the state's attorney prosecuted vigorously), the jury, notwithstanding
the plain evidence and the instructions of the court, went out and in about
such time as it would take them to sign the verdict and return to court, would bring
in a verdict of "Not Guilty."
</p>

<p>
Of course in the criminal court in a case of that kind, the jury is the judge of both
the law and the fact. Therefore, I was not in a position to grant a new trial. The white
jury simply say that law was not the law in Illinois or they would not convict under
such circumstances, and having once acquitted the man the court and the state were
without any remedy. Now I have always thought that was unjust.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It was his opinion that those Negroes who did bring cases into court made
a mistake in prosecuting them from a criminal standpoint. It seemed to be,
in his opinion, hopeless for Negroes to assert their rights through the criminal
courts.
</p>

<p>
Another judge of long experience in the Chicago courts expressed the
view that few Negroes brought in cases involving discrimination. He thought
that especially the better class of Negroes would not bring them because of
the unpleasantness involved and because the damages obtained in most cases
would not pay the attorney's charges. "Most Negroes," he said, "have found
out by experience what the actual feeling is and act accordingly, trying to
avoid unpleasant experiences as much as possible. Although there would
be no trouble in getting a verdict in any clear case, the amount obtained
would not compensate for the trouble involved." He did not believe that
any jury would convict a white defendant on a criminal charge of discrimination.
A prominent Negro attorney, who formerly held a responsible state
office, in giving his general experience said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In cases involving only Negroes on each side, both judges and juries will act
squarely between them; in cases involving white defendants and Negro plaintiffs,
the tendency is to give considerably less credibility or weight to Negro testimony;
in cases involving Negro defendants and white plaintiffs, the tendency is to give more
weight to white testimony.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
He stated further that in discrimination cases, where the law had been
clearly violated, there was usually no difficulty in getting a verdict and damages
for $25 and up, but that he did not care much about handling such cases and
Negroes did not care to push them, because they were unpleasant and expensive.
</p>

<h4>
II. "BLACK AND TAN" RESORTS
</h4>

<p>
The intimate association of Negroes and whites in the cabarets of the South
Side has occasioned frequent and heated protests. Negro men are there seen
with white women and white men with Negro women. Although mixed couples
constitute somewhat less than 10 per cent of the patronage, this mingling is
used to characterize all of the association there. These resorts, with their
liquor selling and coarse and vulgar dancing, are highly dangerous to morals
and established law and order, and a nuisance to the neighborhoods in which
they are located. They are used as amusement places, both by white couples
living in other sections of the city and by Negro couples who live near them.
In fact, although many of the resorts are patronized by an equal number of
whites and Negroes, the actual mixed couples are few. The habituÃ©s of these
resorts are usually of an irresponsible type of pleasure seekers, and frequently
they are vicious and immoral. Newspapers and several of the civic agencies
have violently criticized these places as a menace, but in their attacks the
emphasis has usually been shifted from the menace to morals to that of arousing
sentiment against the mingling of races. The police on numbers of occasions
have been urged to close the places in which this form of association took place.
In most cases they have not done so, stating as their reason that, although
mingling was undesirable, there was no law prohibiting such contacts, and that
evidence of violations of such laws as those concerning liquor selling or decency
would be necessary to warrant their closing.
</p>

<p>
During 1920 the Negro press began a series of attacks on violations of law
and against the immoral resorts in the Negro residence areas, including the
so-called "black and tan" cabarets, some of which were the most notorious
violators. This was followed by similar attacks from the white local newspapers.
The emphasis in the white papers, however, was on the race mingling.
An extract from one of the articles in a white paper is given:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">"Lid" a Joke as Pekin Shimmies Defiance of Law</span>
</p>

<p class="center">
LIQUOR, SIRENS, JAZZ, RACE RAINBOW RIOT IN CAFÃ‰
</p>

<p>
"Lawless liquor," sensuous "shimmy," solicitous sirens, wrangling waiters, all
the tints of the racial rainbow, black and tan and white, dancing, drinking, singing,
early Sunday morning at the Pekin cafÃ©, 2700 South State Street....
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
"BLACK AND TAN AND WHITE"
</p>

<p>
The crowd began to arrive. In came a mighty black man with two white girls.
A scarred white man entered with three girls, two young and painted, the other merely
painted.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Two well dressed youths hopped up the stairs with two timid girls. Seven young
menâ€”they looked like back o' the Yardsâ€”came with two women, one heavy footed,
the other laughing hysterically.
</p>

<p>
Two fur-coated "high yaller" girls romped up with a slender white man. An
attorney gazed happily on the party through horn rimmed glasses. The waiters
called, shouted, whistled when each party arrivedâ€”a full table meant big tips.
</p>

<p>
At one o'clock the place was crowded. Meanwhile a syncopating colored man
had been vamping cotton field blues on the piano. A brown girl sang.... All
the tables were filled at two o'clock, black men with white girls, white men with
yellow girls, old, young, all filled with the abandon brought about by illicit whisky
and liquor music.... The Pekin is again the Pekin of years ago. Only more so.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The reply of a Negro newspaper to the series of articles in the white press
on these resorts expresses the reactions of Negroes to this view:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Black and Tans and Race Riots</span>
</p>

<p>
It is an established conviction that the so-called "intermingling of races" in the
cabarets of the South Side is a fruitful source of riots. To those whose minds are
bent in this belief, the fact that no riot has ever yet started in one of them is of little
importance. Men believe, as a rule, most readily what they earnestly wish to believe.
It matters little how absurd the proposition, if it expresses a desire they will make
of it an everlasting verity even though it costs them the kingdom of heaven. And
so it happens that we are told that the Abyssinians burned a flag and almost precipitated
a race riot because they happened be to standing in front of the Entertainers'
CafÃ© where Negroes and white persons dance on the same floor and occasionally
together.
</p>

<p>
To carry further these deductions the United Cigar Store also should be closed
because one of the fanatics shot into it and killed a white man. The connection
of both of these places with the incident is just about the same, if not a little worse
for the cigar store.
</p>

<p>
The fury back of complaints like that, for instance, of one Mr. Farwell of the Law
and Order League invites suspicion. In all seriousness what is this crime of association
for which Mr. Farwell would have these places closed? If demoralization of
character is more certain in mixed places or liquor sold more openly can it be urged
that race contact is responsible? It cannot. The sore point is the contact. These
places are located in the most densely populated Negro neighborhoods. Attendance
is voluntary and so is whatever amount of association that follows. There is no
manhandling of white innocents to force them into the society of Negroes. Neither
do Negroes go snooping around the high lights of the West or North sides seeking
white companionship. But that is not the point. When this antipathy is analyzed
it becomes apparent that there is a well defined intention to prove that any relationship
varying too sharply from the master and servant type is wrong. It is the yelp
of tribal jealousy. It is the gaunt denial of a fallacious orthodoxy which proclaims
that certain instincts will keep certain persons eternally apart. It is that complex
of emotion into which all discussions of race relations resolve themselves.
</p>

<p>
The resentment of Negroes at the poorly veiled thrusts is perfectly justifiable.
However unwholesome to morals these places may be they refuse to join in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
chorus of hate against amusement places just because they put no restraints upon their
associations. They feel that they are human and at liberty to seek pleasure if they
so desire where contacts are mutually agreeable. Those who do not care for this
contact will stay away. Because a white woman will dance with a colored man or a
white man with a colored woman there is no argument that a riot will follow. Persons
who dance together are not so likely to fight as persons who stand at a distance and
call each other bad names.
</p>

<p>
Rationally considered there is no ground for these contentions. They are
insulting. If danger is ahead for the city when the Irish and Italians visit the same
places of amusement or the Swedes and Lithuanians, then some thought will be given
by Negroes to eliminating their dangers. There is no point to calling the patrol
because Mr. Farwell and the News think it complicates the race question.
</p>

<p>
This paper condemned all of these places because they were nuisances to the
neighborhoodâ€”the blacks, the black and tans and the whitesâ€”it did not by this condemnation
imply that color affects morals.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
III. CULTURAL CONTACTS
</h4>

<p>
Contacts of whites and Negroes in institutions of learning, general cultural
agencies, and meetings ordinarily involve no friction and are frequently directly
beneficial to race relations. Many Negroes visit and use the public libraries.
In fact, instances of objections on the part of the public in this institution
appear to be extremely few. In the reading-rooms Negroes sit where they
wish, and no objections to their presence are noted. At a branch library
on Oakwood Boulevard over 70 per cent of the patronage is of Negroes, and,
the director says, very cordial relations exist. The civil-service system has
made a number of Negroes eligible for positions in the direct public-service
branches of the city government. No apparent difficulties or objections have
resulted.
</p>

<p>
The University of Chicago and Northwestern University have for many
years had Negro students. There were in 1921 more than sixty at the University
of Chicago, and, although many southern white students attend, there
have been no conspicuous difficulties resulting from the associations. On
the contrary, certain individual Negroes have been very popular with the
student body. During the 1920 football season two Negroes were members
of the football squad, and for several years the favorite of the "track" was
Binga Dismond, a Negro runner.
</p>

<p>
There is no Negro member of the City Club or of the Woman's City Club,
although the question of admitting Negroes has occasionally been discussed.
The Chicago Woman's Club has two Negro members, one for more than
fifteen years. Negroes, however, have been welcomed to meetings and in
some instances have themselves held meetings there.
</p>

<p>
A few white churches have several Negro members, usually of long standing.
There are instances of white churches accepting particular Negro members,
with some apprehension that they might bring friends. The Catholic and
Christian Science churches welcome the presence of Negroes at their services.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326' href='#Page_326'>326</a></span>
There is no Christian Science church exclusively for Negroes, and several
hundred Negroes attend the various services of this church.
</p>

<p>
Many of the more definitely intellectual agencies like the Chicago Ethical
Society, the Chicago Rational Society, and the Sunday Evening Club have
regular Negro attendance. At the Chicago Rational Society one of the
young hostesses is a Negro.
</p>

<p>
In these forms of contact it is seldom, if ever, that Negroes are discourteously
received. This may be due to the relatively high class of whites and
Negroes who share these associations.
</p>

<h4>
IV. CONTACTS IN CO-OPERATIVE EFFORTS FOR RACE BETTERMENT
</h4>

<p>
Most of the important social organizations and agencies of the city which
aim definitely at the improvement of the Negro group have mixed boards of
control and supervision. The philanthropy, business ability, and influence of
white members is combined with the influence of Negro members and their
intelligent understanding of their own group problems.
</p>

<p>
The Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian
Association, the Chicago Urban League, Community Service, the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Inter-racial
Committee organized by the Chicago Woman's Club are examples of this form
of joint effort. The sentiments of both groups in contact may be discussed
and, on the basis of represented group conditions and sentiments, programs
are formulated and carried out. This association and exchange of sentiment
provide a means of breaking down the isolation between the groups and at
the same time offer a means of extending the representative thought of Negroes
through their white associates to circles in which contacts are either prohibited
or restricted by custom and tradition.

<h2>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">CRIME AND VICIOUS ENVIRONMENT</span>
</h2>

<p>
The crime rate of Negroes is so largely controlled by a tangle of predisposing
circumstances that it is hardly possible to isolate and measure its factors.
The most important element is the general lawlessness, crime, and vice in the
whole population, irrespective of race.
</p>

<h3>
I. GENERAL CRIME SITUATION
</h3>

<p>
During 1919 there were 330 homicides in Chicago. In 1920, in addition
to 162 murders, 559 persons were slain by automobiles, largely through carelessness.
According to the Chicago Crime Commission's report for 1920 there are
10,000 professional criminals in Chicago, and the annual loss from larcenies,
robberies, and burglaries aggregates $12,000,000. Chicago pays a higher
rate for burglary insurance than any other American city.
</p>

<p>
Crime conditions in Chicago are even worse than is indicated by these
figures, which are based on incomplete police records. In 1919 the police
records showed 1,731 burglaries or persons arrested for burglaries, while
<i>Bulletin No. 9</i> of the Chicago Crime Commission reported 5,509 burglaries
during the first eleven months. During the same period the police records
showed 1,975 robberies or persons arrested for robbery, while the Crime
Commission bulletin listed 2,470 robberies. This bulletin says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
An investigation in August, 1919, to determine whether all crimes were being
reported from the Eleventh Precinct and the Englewood precinct showed that in
forty instances burglaries and robberies committed during the ninety days preceding
had not been reported. A detailed statement of these offenses was prepared giving
the victim's names, addresses, date and amount of loss, and presented to the general
superintendent of police. The list was checked by the departmental inspector and
found correct.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another investigation by the Crime Commission showed that in one month
a certain police captain reported only thirty-seven of the 141 criminal complaints
made to him for his district.
</p>

<p>
In his book, <i>Crime in America and the Police</i>, Raymond B. Fosdick
wrote (1920):
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
London in 1916, with a population of seven and a quarter million, had nine
premeditated murders. Chicago, one-third the size of London, in the same period
had 105, <i>nearly twelve times London's total</i>. In 1916 Chicago with its 2,500,000
people had twenty more murders than the whole of England and Wales with their
38,000,000. The Chicago murders during the year totalled one more than London
during the five-year period, 1910-14 inclusive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In 1917 Chicago had ten more murders than the whole of England and Wales,
and four more murders than all England, Wales, and Scotland. In 1918 Chicago
had fourteen more murders than England and Wales, and in 1919 the number of
murders in Chicago was almost exactly six times the number committed in London.
</p>

<p>
Chicago in 1916 had 532 more burglaries than London; in 1917, 3,459 more;
in 1918, 866 more, and in 1919, 2,146 more. In 1918, for example, Chicago had
twenty-two robberies for every robbery in London, and fourteen robberies for every
robbery in England and Wales.
</p>

<p>
Chicago's arrests for 1917 exceeded London's by 61,874.
</p>

<p>
Thefts of automobiles reported in 1919: New York, 5,527, Chicago 4,316....
London, 290, Liverpool, 10. Comparative statistics as to the number of automobiles
in English and American cities are impossible to obtain.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is apparent that this reign of violence and lawlessness must have a potent
effect upon the crime rate of Negroes in Chicago.
</p>

<h3>
II. PREVALENT IMPRESSIONS REGARDING NEGRO CRIME
</h3>

<p>
In its inquiry the Commission met the following current beliefs among
whites in regard to the Negro criminal:
</p>

<p>
That the Negro is more prone than the white to commit sex crimes, particularly
rape; that he commits a disproportionate number of crimes involving
felonious cuttings and slashings; that the recent migrant from the South is
more likely to offend than the Negro who has resided longer in the North;
and that Negroes willingly tolerate vice and vicious conditions in the midst
of their residence districts. These and similar impressions are compared with
the facts as found by the Commission.
</p>

<h3>
III. CRIMINAL STATISTICS
</h3>

<p>
In its effort to secure information regarding Negro crime the Commission
sought the only available records kept of all crimesâ€”the police records,
especially the annual report of the Department of Police. On examination
these records were found to be of questionable value for any accurate presentation
of Negro crime, or, in fact, of general crime. In 1913 the City Council
Committee on Crime made a study of crimes in Chicago and encountered
the same difficulty. Says the report of this Committee: "The police and
criminal judicial statistics in Chicago are wholly incomplete and are not even
assembled or published by any authority." Further commenting on this
inadequacy, it says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Unfortunately, there is in Illinois no central bureau of criminal statistics through
which statistics from the police department, the courts, the jails, prisons, and the
probation department are collected and correlated. A state bureau of criminal
statistics does exist on our statute books, for, by a law approved June 11, 1912,
the State Charities Commission was directed to establish such a bureau with the
secretary of the Commission as director in charge. This proposed bureau was charged
with the duty of collecting and publishing annually the statistics of Illinois relating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
to crime, and all courts of Illinois, police magistrates, justices of the peace, clerks
of all courts of record, sheriffs, keepers of all places of detention for crime or misdemeanors
or violations of the criminal statutes are to "furnish said bureau annually
such information on request as it may require in compiling such statistics." Up
to the present time, however, owing chiefly to the fact that no appropriation has been
made to cover the expenses of this work, no steps have been taken by the executive
secretary of the Commission towards putting this law into effect. Moreover, there
has never been in Chicago any attempt at an annual "stock-taking" in which the
statistics furnished by the various departments and agencies dealing with the problem
of crime might be brought together and examined with the hope of determining
how far the problem is being adequately met.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Because there has been no systematic handling of criminal statistics, no
method has been developed for accurately measuring the prevalence of crime.
The Crime Commission expressed its difficulty here in this manner:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is very important to note that the number of arrests is not synonymous with
number of crimes, among others reasons because (1) a large number of persons may
be arrested for complicity in a single crime; (2) many innocent persons are arrested
through misapprehension and later discharged; and (3) the vast majority of arrests
are for petty offenses that are not serious enough to be called "crimes" at all. Some
consideration should be given to the question of "new crime." When laws are passed
creating new offenses, there may be an increase in arrests without any corresponding
increase in criminality. As a matter of fact, however, the new offenses are chiefly
those involving misdemeanors and violations of ordinances. New felonies are rarely
created. In Chicago the police classification does, however, include two new offenses
improperly classed as felonies, "contributing to delinquency" and "pandering."
</p>
</div>

<p>
To the difficulties experienced by the City Council Crime Committee in
determining the extent of general crime may be added the even greater difficulty
of comparing the crime record of Negroes with that of other racial groups.
The sources of the police statistics are the bookings by the desk sergeant in
the police station. These are taken from arrest slip notations made by police-station
desk sergeants, before whom persons arrested are brought. The ability
of these desk sergeants correctly to ascertain the prisoner's race or nationality
is open to question. Reports from the Immigrants' Protective League show
that the foreigners arrested are often given wrong racial designations. On
the other hand the classification of Negroes, even of half blood, is never in
doubt. This fact should be remembered in interpreting the figures, for the
Negro will be debited with all the crimes he commits, while figures for other
groups will probably not indicate the full extent of their criminality. Added
to this is the disposition, conscious or unconscious, to arrest Negroes more
freely than whites, to book them on more serious charges, to convict them more
readily, and to give them longer sentences.
</p>

<p>
This bias does not appear in the bare figures, which thus seem to substantiate
the already existing belief that Negroes are more criminal than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
other racial groups. An example of this is found in the bookings in murder
cases. For the six-year period 1914-19 inclusive, 1,121 whites and 193
Negroes were booked for murder, while 501 whites and only twenty-one
Negroes were booked for manslaughter. While Negroes were charged
with 17.1 per cent of the murders, they were charged with only 4.1 per cent
of the cases of manslaughter. This, of course, takes into account bookings
before trial. On the other hand, according to the testimony, they are
more easily convicted on the charges on which they are booked. This fact
introduces another element in the figures, which, although not representing
the actual criminality of Negroes, yet gives plausibility to records. These
situations presented such obvious dangers that the Commission considered
it best to avoid giving currency to figures which carried such clear evidence
of their own inaccuracy and misrepresentation. Since it is necessary to employ
some of these figures despite their inaccuracies, the effort has been made
to use them only where clear comparisons are possible.
</p>

<p>
The Commission is aware that statistics have been prepared giving the
relative crime rates of different national groups, and has inquired into the
sources of such statistics. In one case, for example, population estimates
were based on 1910 census figures, arbitrarily increased by one-third. But
when the abnormal situation with respect to immigration caused by the war,
to mention only one important disturbing factor, is taken into consideration, it
will be appreciated that any estimate is of doubtful value for careful calculation.
</p>

<p>
After much study and experimentation, and particularly after the counsel
of statistical authorities had been obtained, the Commission's plan to work
out comparative racial crime tables was abandoned.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the striking discrepancies between the crime figures of the
Police Department and those of the Chicago Crime Commission, it is doubtful
whether a reliable index to Negro crime as a separate item could be obtained
even if the police figures showed the whole, instead of one-fifth or one-half,
of the crimes committed.<a name='FA_45' id='FA_45' href='#FN_45' class='fnanchor'>[45]</a>
</p>

<p>
It was brought out in the testimony of judges and other authorities that
Negroes are more easily identified and more likely to be arrested, and it is
reasonably certain that a smaller proportion of Negroes who commit crimes
escape than whites. But there is absolutely no means of determining what
proportion of crime unrecorded by the police or other authorities is committed
by whites or Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Adequate comparison of criminal statistics requires at least comparable
units. This is rarely taken into account in comparing Negro and white
crime. For example: a true comparison of relative crime rates between the
two groups would require that the age distribution in each should be the same.
For, although the population figures include children, women, and old persons,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
the greatest proportion of crimes is committed by persons within what is known
to criminologists as the "violent ages," or between eighteen and thirty. If the
population is overbalanced in these ages the crime rate will be exaggerated.
Such an overbalance exists in the Negro population because of the migration
to Chicago of more than 50,000 Negroes, mainly adults. Besides, a greater
proportion of these adults were men without families, another factor known
to overweight crime figures. It is a curious fact, however, that, although
the Negro population of Chicago increased from 2.1 per cent of the total in
1914 to 4.5 per cent in 1919, an increase of more than 100 per cent, the Negro
crime rate during the same period increased 50 per cent, or less than half as
rapidly as the Negro population.
</p>

<p>
The court cases studied intensively by the Commission show that the majority
of Negro criminals are recruited from the lowest economic class of the
Negro group. The frequency with which these persons are taken to the Bureau
of Identification; their inability to provide bonds; their lack of means to
employ attorneys, and their commitment on account of inability to pay fines,
all tend to emphasize the relation between poverty and crime. The economic
factors, as well as the actual commission of crime, determine largely the size
of groups eligible for arrest and conviction. For example, laborers are likely
to contribute more crimes proportionate to the total than salaried men, and
salaried men more than professional men. The proportion of white laboring
men to the total white population is considerably smaller than the proportion
of Negro laboring men to the total Negro population. As a consequence, the
"eligibles" for arrest and conviction are fewer in the white group than in the
Negro group.
</p>

<p>
The reports of the City Council Committee on Crime, known as the
"Merriam Report," and of the Chicago Vice Commission, both indicate that
the economic factor is an important cause of both vice and crime. The following
is from the Vice Commission report:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Among the reasons why women or girls enter the life of prostitution, the economic
question plays a more or less conspicuous part. The low wages paid, the long hours
of standing, insanitary conditions under which girls work in factoriesâ€”all these have
a powerful effect on a woman's or girl's nerves or physical force.
</p>

<p>
First among these causes [for prostitution] should be named unfavorable home
conditions.... Often when the home is not entirely degraded there are conditions
of crowding and poverty which lead to misfortune. Working all day, the girls are
often obliged to work at home in the evening, and if they live in a crowded house
they must go on the street to receive their friends. They are thus practically forced
on the streets for social life.
</p>

<p>
Among the economic conditions contributing to the social evil are the following:
low wages, insanitary conditions, too long hours and high pressure of work;
the over-crowding of houses upon lots; of families in the house, and of persons in
single rooms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' name='Page_332' href='#Page_332'>332</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Merriam report similarly said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The pressure of economic conditions has an enormous influence in producing
certain types of crime. Unsanitary housing and working conditions, unemployment,
wages inadequate to maintain a human standard of living, inevitably produce the
crushed or distorted bodies and minds from which the army of crime is recruited.
The crime problem is not merely a question of police and courts; it leads to the
broader problem of public sanitation, education, home care, living wages and industrial
democracy.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The greater liability of Negroes to unemployment introduces another
factor. A plant official told the Commission that his plant had dismissed more
than 500 Negro girls for business reasons. These girls, it was stated, could not
easily find re-employment and were therefore probably exposed to certain
necessities and temptations from which white girls of comparable status are
exempt.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ratio of convictions to arrest.</i>â€”Police statistics of the relation of convictions
to arrests do not involve the question of faulty source and bias and can therefore
be used. They show that Negro defendants are more frequently convicted
than whites, and this difference is even more pronounced in the more serious
crimes. This excess ranged from 3 to 8 per cent during the period 1914-19.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Negro and sex crimes.</i>â€”Examination of the records of sex offenders
brought into the criminal court in the two-year period 1917-18 showed a total
of 253, of whom thirty-two, or 12.6 per cent, were Negroes. This was lower
than the Negro rate, according to police statistics, for felonies in general.
The sex offenses of Negroes were committed for the most part only against
Negroes, and the specific charges were rape, attempted rape, accessory to
rape, crimes against children, indecent liberties, contributing to delinquency,
incest, adultery, murder by abortion, bigamy, crimes against nature, seduction,
and bastardy. Of crimes against children two out of forty-six were committed
by Negroes, or about 5 per cent, substantially the proportion of Negroes to
the total population. The figures, however, are not a reliable index either
for white or Negro crime because they include only cases passing through the
social-service department of the criminal court.
</p>

<h3>
IV. THE NEGRO IN THE COURTS
</h3>

<p>
During the Commission's inquiry an effort was made to ascertain conditions
in some of the various courts into which Negroes are brought; to learn the
comparative attitudes of judges, prosecutors, and policemen toward Negro
and white offenders, and to learn some of the pertinent facts in the social
history of Negroes brought into these courts.
</p>

<p>
In all, 703 cases were studied, 538 white and 165 Negro. The social
histories showed a conspicuous lack of schooling in the Negroes arrested, more
than half of whom had left school before reaching the age of twelve. This
is two years below the minimum age for children in Illinois. Only eight had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' name='Page_333' href='#Page_333'>333</a></span>
gone beyond the fifth grade. More than 76 per cent were engaged in unskilled
work, and more than 70 per cent had incomes of less than $25 a week. Few
were property owners. More than 50 per cent were locked up because of
inability to furnish bonds.
</p>

<p>
Compared with white prisoners there was little difference in economic
class, ability to provide bonds, or legal representation. There was some
noticeable difference in the character of offenders, varying with the type of
neighborhood, but no general comparisons were possible because the courts
were selected in a manner to get the greatest number of Negro cases.
</p>

<p>
While judges in most courts treated Negro defendants as considerately
as they did whites, conditions in other courts were quite different. One judge
frequently assumed an attitude of facetiousness while hearing Negro cases.
The hearings were characterized by levity and lack of dignity. In one instance
the judge was shaking dice during the hearing of the case.
</p>

<h4>
1. JUVENILE COURT
</h4>

<p>
Between 1913 and 1919, inclusive, the number of Negro boys brought into
the juvenile court increased from 123 to 288, and the number of Negro girls
from 71 to 112. The proportion of Negro boys to the total during this six-year
period decreased from 9 to 6.8 per cent; and the proportion of Negro girls
increased from 5.6 to 14.8 per cent. The proportion for Negro boys represents
a little over twice the proportion of the Negroes to total population, and for
Negro girls about three and one-half times. Although the proportion for both
Negro boys and girls increased from 7.9 per cent in 1913 to 9.9 per cent in 1919,
the Negro population for the same period increased over 100 per cent. The
constant disproportion in the number of Negro boys and girls coming into
the juvenile court points again to infective environment and to other circumstances
heretofore mentioned involved in the crime rate for Negroes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Northern and southern Negro delinquents.</i>â€”Miss Mary Bartelme, assistant
to Judge Arnold, before whom all cases of delinquent girls are tried, said:
"In recent years we have had a large number of colored girls who have come up
from the South to Chicago because their fathers sent for them. Their education
has not been equal to the education of white girls and their mental development
has not been the same."
</p>

<p>
Joseph L. Moss, chief probation officer in the juvenile court, believed that
Negro girls might be more affected by the war situation, the abnormal excitement,
the lure of the uniform, than white girls.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Moss further said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My impression is that southern Negroes contribute just about their portion to
the total number of delinquents. If any difference could be noted I might say that
the delinquencies of the southern Negro might be more often classed as misdemeanors
than as the more serious offenses. One noted at times a sort of irresponsibility on
the part of southern Negro delinquents which seemed to me to be traceable to the
difference in standards between former environment and the present one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'>334</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Differences in delinquency of Negro and white children.</i>â€”No information
could be secured to show that the conduct for which Negro children are brought
into court is in any way different from the conduct of all delinquent children.
On this point Miss Bartelme testified: "I get all offenses committed by girls
under eighteen years of age. I want to say that the offenses of white and
colored are very much the same as far as those offenses come before me."
Mr. Moss testified before the Commission: "From my experience I would
say that there is no significant difference between acts for which colored
delinquent boys are brought into court, and the acts for which white delinquent
boys are brought into court, with this exception: that larceny, as an offense,
seems to have a considerable lead over other offenses."
</p>

<p>
<i>Comparative environment.</i>â€”Since many of the delinquent children who
come into the juvenile court, particularly first offenders, are placed on probation,
comparative environment of white and Negro children is important. This
subject does not lend itself to statistical presentation, but Miss Bartelme said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Negro girls have not the same supervision that many of the white girls of their
same class have, because in so many instances both parents are working, and the
girls are left alone. They come home from school to a house that is closed. There
is no one to receive them, and that, with a child, is always a very serious matter.
The environment in which they live is not equal to the environment of the white
girls. In these homes lack of privacy is greater than in the homes of the same class
of white girls, therefore making life much more difficult and temptations more numerous.
These conditions are much worse on account of the recent congestion, but they
have existed right along. Negro children have been allowed to live in worse quarters,
more crowded quarters, than the other children.... We feel that in placing the
children on probation, especially colored girls, they are placed in a home which often
is not a home because the mother is away at work.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. O. J. Milliken, for many years a public-school principal in Chicago,
and now superintendent of the Chicago and Cook County School for Boys,
to which the milder delinquent cases are committed, testified:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I should not like to be recorded as giving a criticism of the Board of Education,
because I know that the present Board of Education believes in what I have to say
now, but this is true: the colored boys are in the district that has practically been
abandoned by the white people and the schools are only boxes for them to go to
school in. You don't find any of the $900,000 school buildings in the colored population
district, and I think that the time is approaching when the old system will be
changed and we will have the vocational work, etc., thoroughly organized in the schools
in these districts where most needed.<a name='FA_46' id='FA_46' href='#FN_46' class='fnanchor'>[46]</a> In dealing with boys I think more complaints
come along that line than in any other, and I have made a report to the superintendent
of schools on that at different times.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Boys who are "trusties" in the above school are allowed to secure jobs
in Chicago. Their difficulties were outlined by Mr. Milliken as follows:
"After a boy has been committed by the Juvenile Court, he is known by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' name='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>335</a></span>
police, and I have four or five colored boys today who are carrying letters
from me asking the police to please allow these boys to go to work, and if the
boys are in trouble to notify our institution."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Milliken told how, when the boys are seen on the streets, they are
picked up by the police. He referred to "one of the finest lads we have had"
and said, "I think probably within the last three months I have had to get
him out of the hands of the police by calling up the police department twenty
times, to get him to work." This difficulty, in Mr. Milliken's opinion, was
more common in regard to Negro than white delinquents.
</p>

<h4>
2. BUREAU OF IDENTIFICATION
</h4>

<p>
While only 11.5 per cent of all persons arrested in Chicago in 1919 were
Negroes, more than 21 per cent of all persons held on criminal charges in 1919
and taken to the Detective Division Identification Section were Negroes.
In proportion to total arrests about twice as many Negroes as whites were taken
to the Identification Bureau. Explanations of this disproportion by officials
indirectly connected with this branch of the department and familiar with its
methods are illuminating.
</p>

<p>
Judges of the criminal court have stated that "Negroes look alike," and
that it is "more difficult offhand to place them than it is to identify a white
criminal"; that Negroes are frequently taken to the Bureau for identification
when white men would not be arrested or would be at once recognized, picked
up, and booked.
</p>

<p>
Again, it is explained that it is unquestionably safer "to pick up and
mug" a Negro than a white person, because there is less fear of an unpleasant
"comeback." Negroes have fewer resources and less influence with which
to insure their fair treatment, and so are more likely to be subjected to
annoyance.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental reason, however, is perhaps more economic than racial.
The <i>City Council Crime Committee Report</i>, or "Merriam Report," says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The department of police maintains a bureau of identification with a system of
photographs and finger prints, but it is largely a matter of chance as to who is photographed,
and as to whether the record of criminality is asked for before he is sentenced,
the judge relying largely on the statement of the prisoner and the memory of the officer.
In general, all prisoners who are held to the Grand Jury and are not released on bail
are taken to the bureau, photographed, and their finger prints are taken. This seems a
very unfair and illogical arrangement. If there is a reason for photographing a man
before he is tried and while he is still only a suspect, the reason should apply equally
to those in jail and those on bail. The practice of taking the finger prints and photographs
of only the men and women who cannot afford bail, seems hard to justify.<a name='FA_47' id='FA_47' href='#FN_47' class='fnanchor'>[47]</a>
</p>
</div>

<h4>
3. PROBATION AND PAROLE
</h4>

<p>
It appears from the testimony of officials and others interested in the care
of offenders that the Negro on probation or parole is handicapped by his color.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_336' name='Page_336' href='#Page_336'>336</a></span>
He is more likely to be interrogated as a suspect; is more frequently arrested,
and perhaps "mugged," and is in more danger of being molested even while on
legitimate business. The principal sources of information on this subject were:
</p>

<p>
1. Statistics from the Municipal Department of Adult Probation.
</p>

<p>
2. Statistics from state institutions.
</p>

<p>
3. Testimony of John L. Whitman, state superintendent of prisons;
John M. Houston, head of the Municipal Department of Adult Probation;
and Dr. F. Emory Lyon, superintendent of the Central Howard Association.
</p>

<p>
The figures provided from institutions are probably accurate, since they
are based on actual count, and do not involve any of the factors overweighting
crime statistics.
</p>

<p>
<i>Number admitted to probation.</i>â€”From 1911 to January 1, 1920, 27,252
whites and 1,917 Negroes were admitted to probation after conviction in
the municipal and criminal courts. Negroes were thus slightly less than 7
per cent of the total. For the six-year period ended January 1, 1920, Negro
arrests for misdemeanors, according to police records, averaged 8.20 per cent
and for felonies 11.13 per cent. On convictions for misdemeanors, Negroes
average about 8.5 per cent of the total, and for felonies, over 13 per cent.
The percentage of Negroes among all offenders placed on probation is thus
less than the percentage of Negroes among those convicted in either group.
In other words, the convicted white man seems more likely to be put on probation
than the convicted Negro.
</p>

<p>
Probation depends largely upon the attitude of the judges. The total
number of persons placed on probation has remained virtually the same from
year to year. In fact, 164 fewer persons were put on probation in 1920 than
in 1919; so that the migration of southern Negroes does not seem to have
affected this situation.
</p>

<p>
<i>Extent to which probationers "make good."</i>â€”There are no exact figures
showing the relative degree to which white and Negro probationers justify
the leniency shown them, but Judge Houston testified before the Commission:
"I do not think there is any difference. I am satisfied that the results are
equally as good in the colored cases as in the white. I don't see any material
difference between a colored man and a white man, so far as their truthfulness
and reliability are concerned."
</p>

<p>
<i>Institutional figures.</i>â€”Official reports were submitted by the following
state correctional and penal institutions: Chester State Hospital for the
Criminal Insane, Pontiac Reformatory, Southern Illinois Penitentiary at
Menard, and Joliet Penitentiary. No prisoners are paroled from Chester
State Hospital.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Pontiac reported that last year 45 Negroes and 294 whites had been paroled.
Of the Negroes 88 per cent, and of the whites 80 per cent, had "made good."
</p>

<p>
Menard reported that 50 Negroes and 168 whites had been paroled. Of the
Negroes 76 per cent, and of the whites 81 per cent, had "made good."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_337' name='Page_337' href='#Page_337'>337</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Joliet reported that 61 Negroes and 223 whites had been paroled. Of the Negroes
69 per cent, and of the whites 74 per cent, "made good."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Totals for all the above institutions show that the percentages of Negro
and white paroled who "make good" are nearly the same, the Negro rate
being 76.9 per cent and the white 78.2 per cent.
</p>

<p>
John L. Whitman, state superintendent of prisons, who has had a continuous
experience covering more than twenty-six years in correctional and penal
institutions, testified before the Commission:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

If there is a consistent effort being made to prepare inmates of prisons for good
citizenship when they are released, the colored man responds as readily as the white,
but it is a question in my mind whether the colored man can profit as much by it
when he gets out as the white man can. That, however, is not due to a natural
inclination; perhaps his opportunities on the outside are not as good.... I think
if the reports of those on parole from the state institutions now are closely studied,
it will be found that they have more difficulties to surmount on the outside than the
whites. If you assumed the white and colored ex-convicts on a par when they get
out, the colored ex-convict would find it more difficult to lead the "straight and
narrow"â€”on account of the forces set against him he is more greatly handicapped.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Dr. F. Emory Lyon, superintendent of the Central Howard Association,
an organization which for twenty years has been dealing with ex-convicts,
testified:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have found this greater difficulty in dealing with colored menâ€”in finding
suitable rooming places within their means. Of course we could always find rooms
recommended by the colored Y.M.C.A., or some such source as that, but generally
for desirable places charges were beyond their means.
</p>

<p>
My experience in dealing with the colored and white, and in getting them employment,
and in observing their satisfactory fulfilment of their paroles, is that possibly
a little larger percentage of colored men make good on their paroles. They take any
kind of employment by which they can make an honest living. I notice in our report
of this year that out of 972 assisted, discharged and paroled men, ninety-two were
colored men. This would be just about 10 per cent. I think that is probably a fair
proportion each year in the history of the Association.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Colonel C. B. Adams, managing officer of St. Charles School for boys,
said: "We have seven farm cottages.... but we rarely send a Negro boy
to the farm cottage for the reason that it is almost impossible for him to secure
employment on the farms. The farmers in northern Illinois.... are prejudiced
against colored help, and it is almost impossible for us to secure
employment on the farm for a colored boy."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Clara Hayes, managing officer of the State Training School for Girls
at Geneva, said: "I think the proportion of the colored girls who are returned
for one cause or another is practically the same as the proportion of white
girls.... I think the proportion of those recurring from misconduct is
practically the same."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' name='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>338</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. O. J. Milliken, of the Chicago and Cook County School for boys, said
that Negro boys equaled white boys in fulfilling satisfactorily the requirements
for those paroled.
</p>

<h4>
4. INSTITUTIONAL INQUIRY
</h4>

<p>
Through the co-operation of John L. Whitman, state superintendent of
prisons, information was secured regarding comparative treatment and conduct
of white and Negro inmates of Illinois. The data covered the State Penitentiary
at Joliet, Southern Illinois Penitentiary at Menard, State Reformatory
at Pontiac, and State Hospital for the Criminal Insane at Chester.
</p>

<p>
<i>Total number of prisoners.</i>â€”In the total number of inmates in those institutions,
the percentage of Negroes is much larger than the percentage convicted
of felonies in Chicago. The percentage of Negroes among all persons convicted
of felonies in Chicago for a six-year period averaged 13.1 per cent, whereas
their proportion among all inmates of these prisons is about 23 per cent.
Omitting the Southern Illinois Penitentiary, the proportion is about 20 per cent.
This disproportion is in part explained by facts brought out elsewhere showing
that Negroes receive much longer sentences and fewer paroles (see <a href="#Page_330">p. 330</a>).
</p>

<p>
All these institutions reported that in no cases were Negro and white
prisoners kept in the same cells. Mr. Whitman stated that this arrangement
was preferred by both whites and Negroes. Negro and white prisoners are
not segregated in separate cell sections but occupy adjoining cells in the same
block. "They are all in the same cell house; they are together in the shops;
in cottages; in the farm where there are dormitories."
</p>

<p>
Negro and white prisoners eat in the same dining-room at the same time
and at the same table. "The tables are for six or eight and there will be
colored and white at the same table." They also attend public meetings
together. Mr. Whitman also stated that in all the institutions Negroes and
whites mingled without distinction, and that the result had been satisfactory.
There was no difference in food, clothing, employment, cells, or discipline for
Negro prisoners as a group from that of white prisoners because of the Negro's
character or deportment. In no case was racial discrimination in such matters
used as a means of discipline or punishment.
</p>

<p>
<i>Conduct in prison.</i>â€”There is no exact system for appraising conduct
within the prison, but at Mr. Whitman's request persons were appointed in
each institution to examine the record of each inmate as to conduct and
tabulate the results. These and other data secured by Superintendent Whitman
indicate that Negroes are less amenable to prison discipline than whites,
but that their violations of rules are not so grave.
</p>

<p>
The percentage of Negro inmates whose conduct was marked "satisfactory"
was smaller in all institutions than the percentage of whites. At Pontiac
the difference in conduct was negligible. The greatest disparity was in Menard
(in the southern part of the state), where the difference amounted to more
than 20 per cent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' name='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>339</a></span>
</p>

<h4>
5. OTHER CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS
</h4>

<p>
<i>St. Charles School for Boys</i> receives delinquent boys between ten and seventeen
years of age from the whole state. Negro and white boys are accepted
up to the capacity limit. Negro boys are 12.5 per cent of the total, or slightly
above the proportion which the Cook County Juvenile Court report shows Negro
boys bear to the total of delinquent boys. Since 1915, the Negro population
at St. Charles has increased from 8 per cent to 12.5 per cent of the total, or
approximately half as rapidly as the Negro population in Chicago. St. Charles
is conducted on the cottage plan, there being twenty-two cottages. Negro
and white boys live in the same cottage, eat in the same dining-room, and use
the same playground.
</p>

<p>
Four out of the twelve cadet companies have Negro captains, and these
have more white than Negro boys under them. There are no racial difficulties
in regard to employment or discipline, and the general conduct of Negro and
white boys was reported to be the same. Colonel C. B. Adams, managing
officer, said: "I really think mentally, and I am sure physically, the colored
boys, such as come into the institution today, are superior to the white boys.
We make much of athletics in the school and the best athletes we have are
colored boys."
</p>

<p>
<i>Geneva State Training School for Girls</i> had 417 girls in 1917, 475 in 1918,
and 445 in 1920. The increase over 1917 is proportionately the same for
white and Negro girls. In 1920, out of 445 girls, eighty-three, or about 18.5
per cent, were Negro. Conditions at Geneva are substantially similar to those
at St. Charles, with the exception that in one cottage, Negro and white girls
eat at different tables. This, the managing officer, Dr. Clara B. Hayes,
says is mutually agreeable. No difficulties exist with regard to employment
or discipline. As to conduct on probation and parole, Dr. Hayes thought there
was no material difference between Negro and white girls.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago and Cook County School for Boys.</i> This school is located in Riverside,
just west of Chicago, on a farm belonging to the City of Chicago. The
county feeds and clothes the boys; the city erects the buildings, and the
Board of Education manages the school and pays all salaries. There are
three buildings holding forty boys each. About 600 boys go through the
institution in a year. It is a "testing out" school and working boys' institution
to which first offenders between the ages of ten and eighteen are committed
through the juvenile court. In 1919 the Negro boys were 15 per cent of the
total; in 1920, less than 7 per cent. This decline Mr. Milliken, the managing
officer, thought to be due to the cessation of Negro migration.
</p>

<p>
The treatment accorded Negro boys in cottages and at meals, play, and
work is identical with that given white boys. There is no difference in discipline.
Race prejudice is not prominent, and the boys are said to be most
democratic with each other regardless of color. The director says: "They
work together, beautifully; the idea [of prejudice] never enters into their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' name='Page_340' href='#Page_340'>340</a></span>
heads. I think it is the outside influence that brings about these conditions
[of prejudice]."
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Parental School.</i> To this school, situated on the North Side of the
city, truants from the public schools of Chicago are committed by the juvenile
court. The total number of pupils last year included 993 boys and eighteen
girls. The Negro boys numbered eighty and the Negro girls five.
</p>

<p>
The treatment accorded white and Negro children is the same. No
difference in regard to discipline or punishment exists. Race prejudice is
not apparent, and the children's attitude toward each other seems not to be
influenced by color. The deportment of Negro and white children is reported
to be the same.
</p>

<p>
<i>House of Correction.</i> To this institution adult misdemeanants are committed.
Information concerning conditions was furnished by Joseph Siman,
superintendent.
</p>

<p>
The total number of inmates in 1919 was 5,723, and 1,151, or more than
20 per cent, were Negroes. This percentage is larger than the percentages
of Negroes among persons arrested on misdemeanor charges and among those
convicted.
</p>

<p>
Negro inmates are not put in the same cells with whites, but are frequently
lodged in the same tier of cells. There are separate blocks of cells, but no
separate tiers for whites and Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The prisoners eat together in the same dining-room. They march from
their cells or work to meals, meetings, and church services and usually sit in
the same order as that in which they march.
</p>

<p>
No race prejudice is noticeable among prisoners, and no racial clashes
or unpleasant experiences have occurred in the institution.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cook County Jail.</i> The greatest discrimination noted in the course of the
institution inquiry was at the Cook County Jail, where segregation has been
carried out in nearly every department. The statements below are based on
interviews with Chief Deputy Sheriff Laubenheimer and with Mr. King of
the sheriff's office, who was chief clerk at the jail at the time of this
study.
</p>

<p>
Negroes are completely segregated in cells on the first two floors in the new
jail. Sometimes, when the jail is crowded, a few Negroes are put in among
the whites, but whites are not often put in the part of the jail where Negroes
are segregated. A condemned Negro murderer is placed with white condemned
murderers in the section set apart for condemned murderers. Similarly Negro
boys are placed with white boys in the boys' section of the jail.
</p>

<p>
Meals are served to all prisoners in their cells. The Negroes have a separate
"bull pen" for exercise but are given the same facilities as the whites. They
have separate church services. Negro guards have charge of the Negro
prisoners. The conduct of Negroes, according to the observation of Mr.
King, is practically the same as that of the whites.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_341' name='Page_341' href='#Page_341'>341</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Out of a total of 8,616 inmates in the county jail in 1919 there were 1,655
Negroes, or about 19 per cent. This is larger than the proportion of Negroes
among all arrested or convicted. The report of the City Council Crime
Committee showed that inmates of the county jail were confined there to a
large extent on account of poverty.
</p>

<h3>
V. NEGRO CRIME AND ENVIRONMENT
</h3>

<p>
<i>Housing.</i>â€”Housing must be considered as an important element in the
environmental causes of crime. Elsewhere this report presents a more detailed
study of housing and it will suffice here to call attention to the prevalence of
taking lodgers which is economically necessary in many Negro homes, and the
consequent danger to the integrity of the family; to the laxity of law enforcement
in certain sections; to the condition of streets and alleys; and to frequent
instances of defective housing which have the effect of driving the children
into the streets or to questionable places of amusement.
</p>

<p>
<i>Recreation.</i>â€”A comprehensive inquiry into the relations between recreation
and delinquency, made by the Cleveland Foundation in 1917, showed that the
use of leisure time had a relation to delinquency in 75 per cent of the cases
observed, and that 51 per cent of the leisure time of the delinquent child was
spent in ways that were aimless and undirected; while in the case of the
"wholesome" child, only seven-tenths of 1 per cent of the spare time was thus
spent. Local studies made by T. J. Szmergalski, of the West Chicago Park
Commission, show that the establishment of a supervised park or playground
tends to decrease complaints of delinquency from 30 to 40 per cent within
the range of its usefulnessâ€”a radius of about three-quarters of a mile. With
these facts as a background it is significant that there is no recreation center
and only a few small playgrounds freely available for Negro children within
the congested Negro district. In many of the crowded areas inhabited by
foreign colonies are well-equipped recreation centers with model field houses,
used by thousands of persons from these districts. The facilities available
to Negro children and young people in this respect are much less adequate.<a name='FA_48' id='FA_48' href='#FN_48' class='fnanchor'>[48]</a>
</p>

<p>
Bathing-beaches, which are a summer-time boon to Chicago residents,
foreign and native, are not freely accessible to Negroes. The tragic incidents
in which the riot of 1919 began, illustrate the discriminatory attitude frequently
observed when Negroes attempt to enjoy some of these recreational
facilities.
</p>

<p>
The importance of these recreation opportunities is further emphasized
in the <i>Annual Report of the Crime Commission</i> in its section on recreation.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The answer to the lack of a sufficient number of well-ordered places of recreation
and amusement is to be found in the thriving condition of Chicago's cheap dance
halls, underworld cabarets, unsupervised movie theatres of the cheaper class and
the large number of pool-rooms scattered throughout the city. These establishments
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' name='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>342</a></span>
are the worst breeders of crime with which this community has to contend
and they should be subjected to rigid police regulations on the part of the municipal
authorities.
</p>

<p>
The chief counteracting influences of such places of amusement are the parks,
playgrounds and other municipal recreation centers, and there is a great need for the
establishment of more of these, particularly in the congested districts.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Psychological.</i>â€”It is the opinion of criminologists that a "warped" mind
is responsible for many crimes. This general condition is true of Negroes as
well as whites. But another factor appears in many crimes of Negroes.
The traditional ostracism, exploitation and petty daily insults to which they
are continually exposed have doubtless provoked, even in normal-minded
Negroes, a pathological attitude toward society which sometimes expresses
itself defensively in acts of violence and other lawlessness. A desire for social
revenge might well be expected to result from the facetious and insulting
manner in which Negroes are often treated by officers of the law.
</p>

<p>
<i>"Infective" environment.</i>â€”Much of what is said in the <i>Annual Report of
the Crime Commission</i> for 1920 regarding the relation of infective environment
to crime, can be fairly applied to the congested South Side areas of Negro
residence:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Infective environment as a cause of crime is classified separately from problems
of home environment because where the latter may be conducive to the proper
rearing of children into manhood and womanhood, the influence immediately outside
the home may be exactly the opposite. There are, in a great city like Chicago,
certain neighborhoods in which influences are at work continuously to produce
criminals. While the production of criminals is by no means confined to any one
section of the city but is widespread throughout the community, still there are sections
in which conditions are such that the growing child is indeed fortunate if he can attain
manhood without being led to commit some offense against society.
</p>

<p>
In Chicago our chief district of this character is, or was until recently at least,
"Canaryville" and much of the other territory immediately adjacent to the Stock Yards.
It was this section which produced "Moss" Enright, "Sonny" Dunn, Eugene Geary,
the Gentlemen brothers and many others of Chicago's worst type of criminals. It is
in this district that "athletic clubs" and other organizations of young toughs and
gangsters flourish, and where disreputable poolrooms, hoodlum-infested saloons and
other criminal hangouts are plentiful.
</p>

<p>
Often it has been the case that public officials having such constituencies have
utilized these conditions to further their own political advantages without making
the slightest effort to bring about improvements, in some instances, actually assisting
their constituents to violate the law in order to aid the building up of their political
machines.... Improvement of districts of this character and the elimination of
such conditions within them is highly essential if organized crime is to be reduced.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Vice.</i>â€”Vice districts and Negro residence districts are now and have long
been close together. As late as 1905 a segregated vice district was tolerated
on the West Side, on Green, Peoria, Sangamon, Morgan, Curtis, Carpenter,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' name='Page_343' href='#Page_343'>343</a></span>
and Randolph streets, and Washington Boulevard. Just north of this district
on Lake, Walnut, and Fulton streets, lived Negroes, segregated by public
sentiment. Another vice district was along Custom House Place, now Federal
Street, near which Negroes lived, similarly segregated by public sentiment.
When this vice district was moved southward to Twenty-second Street it had
a fringe of Negro residence. Later this district was abolished, and now vice
of this kind is scattered and more clandestine and is to be found farther south,
largely between Thirty-first and Fifty-fifth streets. More than 75 per cent
of the Negro population of the city lives in this area.

THE AREA OUTLINED IN BLACK SHOWS
THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RECOGNIZED
SEGREGATED VICE DISTRICT WHICH WAS
IN EXISTENCE UP TO NOVEMBER, 1912.</p>
</div>

<p>
Concerning the proximity of Negro residence areas to vice areas, the
Chicago Vice Commission report in 1911 said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The history of the social evil in Chicago is intimately connected with the colored
population. Invariably the large vice districts have been created within or near the
settlements of colored people. In the past history of the city every time a new vice
district was created downtown or on the South Side, the colored families were in
the district, moving in just ahead of the prostitutes. The situation along State Street
from Sixteenth Street south is an illustration.
</p>

<p>
So whenever prostitutes, cadets and thugs were located among white people and
had to be moved for commercial or other reasons, they were driven to undesirable
parts of the city; the so-called colored residential sections.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The chief of police in 1912 warned prostitutes that so long as they confined
their residence to districts west of Wabash Avenue and east of Wentworth
Avenue, they would not be disturbed. This area contained at that time the
largest group of Negroes in the city, with most of their churches, Sunday
schools, and societies.
</p>

<p>
The Vice Commission report further said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In addition to this proximity to immoral conditions young colored girls are
often forced into idleness because of prejudice against them and they are eventually
forced to accept positions as maids in houses of prostitution.
</p>

<p>
Employment agents do not hesitate to send colored girls as servants to these
houses. They make the astounding statement that the law does not allow them to
send white girls, but they will furnish colored help.
</p>

<p>
In summing up, it is an appalling fact that practically all of the male and female
servants connected with houses of prostitution in vice districts and in disorderly
flats in residence sections are colored....
</p>

<p>
The apparent discrimination against colored citizens of the city in permitting
vice to be set down in their very midst is unjust and abhorrent to all fair-minded
people. Colored children should receive the same moral protection that white
children receive.
</p>

<p>
The prejudice against colored girls who are ambitious to earn an honest living
is unjust. Such an attitude eventually drives them into immoral surroundings.
They need special care and protection on the maxim that it is the duty of the strong
to help the weak. Any effort, therefore, to improve conditions in Chicago should
provide more wholesome surroundings for the families of its colored citizens who
now live in communities of colored people.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' name='Page_344' href='#Page_344'>344</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
That many Negroes live near vice districts is not due to their choice nor
to low moral standards, but to three causes: (1) Negroes are unwelcome in
desirable white residence localities; (2) small incomes compel them to live in
the least expensive places regardless of surroundings; while premises rented
for immoral purposes bring notoriously high rentals, they make the neighborhood
undesirable and the rent of other living quarters there abnormally
low; and (3) Negroes lack sufficient influence and power to protest effectively
against the encroachments of vice.
</p>

<p>
The records of convictions in the morals court and the evidence of the
Committee of Fifteen show the gradual drift of prostitution southward coincidentally
with the expansions of the main area of Negro residence.
</p>

<p>
Between 1916 and 1918 houses of prostitution decreased from forty-eight
to twenty-five in number in the territory between Twelfth and Twenty-second
streets, and from 130 to 107 between Twelfth and Thirty-first streets. Between
Thirty-first and Thirty-fifth streets, the number had slightly increased,
while there was an increase of nearly 80 per cent between Thirty-fifth and
Thirty-ninth streets. In the combined districts between Thirty-first and
Thirty-ninth streets the number increased from sixty-two to eighty-four;
and between Thirty-ninth and Fifty-fifth streets the increase was from eleven
to fifty-four.
</p>

<p>
These are probably only a fraction of the number that really exist there,
and while they are too few to be conclusive, they are significant when considered
in relation to the movement of the Negro population. The accompanying
maps show that the figures coincide substantially with the expansion of
Negro residence areas southward and eastward.
</p>

<p>
Further evidence of this movement of vicious resorts, and an abnormally
large number of them, into the Negro areas was obtained from the state's
attorney's office, the Commission's investigations, and from confidential
reports submitted by other organizations. Most of these places are maintained
by white persons, because in this district there is less likelihood of effective
interference, either from citizens or public authorities.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cabarets and gambling.</i>â€”In close relation to the disorderly houses are the
vicious cabarets in the Negro areas on the South Side. Their reputation and
the conditions existing in them have been given much publicity by the local
press.
</p>

<p>
Gambling was found to be prevalent at many places in this section, and
only slight effort was made to conceal violations of the law. Under the guise
of "clubs" some places were being operated as gambling houses with dice and
card games predominating. Other places, apparently with little fear of the
police, both conducted and permitted gambling with cards and on pool games.
Baseball pools and "policy," as well as betting on horse-race returns, were
prevalent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' name='Page_345' href='#Page_345'>345</a></span>
</p>

<h3>
VI. VIEWS OF AUTHORITIES ON CRIME AMONG NEGROES
</h3>

<p>
Much information was secured from conferences with numerous authorities
on crime: judges of the juvenile, municipal, circuit, superior and criminal
courts; the general superintendent of police and police captains, former high
police officials; heads of correctional and penal institutions; the state's
attorney; experts on probation and parole, representatives from the sheriff's
office; and social workers having intimate knowledge of crime conditions.
</p>

<p>
The views of those authorities are an important aid in giving proper
interpretation to the factors which cause crime among Negroes, and to the
circumstances connected with crime prejudicial to Negroes as compared with
whites. For example, the testimony is practically unanimous that Negroes
are much more liable to arrest than whites, since police officers share in the
general public opinion that Negroes "are more criminal than whites," and
also feel that there is little risk of trouble in arresting Negroes, while greater
care must be exercised in arresting whites.
</p>

<p>
The Negro crime rate is exaggerated quite as much by the fewer arrests
of whites than Negroes, in comparison with the number of crimes committed,
as by the ease with which many Negroes may be arrested for one crime. We
have already noted the remarkable discrepancy between the police reports
of crimes committed and the actual crimes listed by the Crime Commission.
Fewer Negroes than whites escape arrest and prosecution. When comparisons
are made on the basis of statistics for arrests and convictions, there is
presented, unless proper explanations of the statistics are made, an exaggerated
picture of Negro crime.
</p>

<p>
The views of many of these authorities on various branches of this inquiry
are here given:
</p>

<h4>
1. FEWER PROFESSIONAL AND BANDED CRIMINALS AMONG NEGROES
</h4>

<p>
Judge Edmund Jarecki, municipal court:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I know of no built-up organization of Negroes that would have any particular
control over criminals.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Daniel P. Trude, municipal court:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think Negro criminals are more isolated. My experience in the boys' court
was with the colored boys who would go out and steal clothes, a new shirt or some
socks, or something of that sort that they could pick off the back porch. I found
that there was considerable of that, but they are very partial and take from their
own people.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Charles M. Thomson, criminal court:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Negro crime is not organized, but individual, I should say, almost without
exception.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Kickham Scanlan, criminal court:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In May, 1920, I was assigned to the North Side to try some unbailable murder
cases. It was found that there were over 500 homicide cases ... these were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' name='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
nearly all cases in which gangs of young white men confederated together to go out
and hold up places, and they made a business of it, and some of these gangs have
committed any number of hold-ups, and one member of the gang explained that
he had killed as many as twenty victims. The evidence showed that they killed
when they didn't have to kill, just recklessly and wantonly. In none of the cases of
the character I have talked about were there any colored defendants. They were
all white men ... there were some of the most vicious cases I know anything about
in my thirty-four years of experience.
</p>

<p>
I just want to make that one point to this Commission, that never in the history
of this community has the white race stood so low from the standpoint of crime as
it does at the present time. White young men are banding together in gangs and
deliberately going out and holding people up, right and left, and shooting them down.
I notice that there are a few colored imitators of the white men, but the bad man of
the city of Chicago at the present time is the young white man.
</p>
</div>

<p>
General Leroy T. Steward, former chief of police:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think generally speaking that the Negro criminals work as individuals. I only
recall one instance where there was a gang of colored men that came to my attention,
but I know of many white gangs.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Dr. Herman Adler, state criminologist:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
You asked a question in regard to gangsâ€”whether there is a combination among
Negroes. There are not many. They are more individual, but on the other hand
the lower grade of Negroes are likely to be the tools of the others at times; they have
been used that way. Where you are dealing with murder, with sex crimes, with
certain forms of burglary, larceny, you are usually dealing with individual
criminals....
</p>

<p>
Now there is here, in Chicago, professional organized crime. The colored people
as a whole are less engaged in professional crime and they are more the accidental,
casual criminal or the low-grade person with a strong temper and a strong physique
etc., who slips into crime by following the line of least resistance.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Major L. M. C. Funkhouser:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Negro criminals are not organized.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Professor Charles E. Merriam:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My belief is that the Negro criminals are not so well organized as the white.
They don't go much in bands; furthermore, they are not so much in the class of
professional criminals as they are in the class of occasional criminals. It seems to
me that the colored offender is the individual offender; his crimes are more of haste
or passion. He is in the occasional offender class.

<h4>
2. SEX CRIME AMONG NEGROES AS COMPARED WITH WHITES
</h4>

<p>
Judge Edmund Jarecki:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
So far as sex crimes are concerned, during the time I have been there [in the
boys' court] I have not noticed anything that would indicate any difference between
colored and white boys.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_347' name='Page_347' href='#Page_347'>347</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Charles M. Thomson:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In my work with the criminal court, I was astonished at the large number of
criminals involving the sexual abuse of children, but I remember no case in which
a colored defendant was charged with that crime. Almost all races were represented,
but I don't remember one colored man charged with the abuse of a child. There
were many, however, accused of adultery.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Hugo Pam, criminal court:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have had more serious rape cases against white than against colored people.
The most serious case I had was about ten days ago, and I sentenced the man to life
imprisonment. I never had such a case involving a Negro.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Kickham Scanlan, criminal court:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I do not think Negroes are more liable to sex crimes than whites. I tried a
colored man six or eight years ago for rape. He founded an alleged orphan asylum.
The evidence showed that he had held a number of young children in that place.
He got life in the penitentiary. He was the only colored man ever tried before me
with any offense of that character. The children in that case were colored children.
But I have tried a number of white men for rape, and while I have had ten or a dozen
cases of crimes against children, in my twelve years' experience on the bench, I have
never had a case of a colored man charged with crime against children.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
3. OFFENSES AGAINST MORALS
</h4>

<p>
Judge Arnold Heap:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The number of colored cases in the morals court is largely disproportionate to
the number of Negroes in the total Chicago population. There are more colored
cases now in the morals court than formerly because in the past the houses kept by
white people with colored inmates were alone held responsible. Since colored people
are now doing business on their own responsibility, they are at present brought in
the same as white people. At first the Negro newcomers were strangers to our
surroundings and were not such frequent offenders, but as that strangeness wore off
they became familiar with vice as it exists among us today. The offenses of these
new comers are about the same as those of the northern Negroes. Some persons
think that the immorality of the colored is more gross than that of the whites, but
I have my doubts about it. One factor in the problem is that colored people of the
poorer class crowd together in smaller quarters than whites, and this tends to a lesser
type of morality because they are so crowded.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Wells M. Cook, municipal court:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Prostitution among the white people in Chicago in 1918 was more or less clandestine,
in flats and cheap hotels and in private homes, and more or less under cover.
The colored people, living largely in one section of the city, and being naturally of a
social, emotional temperament, are apt to congregate in places and in resorts where
the police could more easily raid them, and are much more easily apprehended.
That is about the only reason I can see for the disproportionate number of colored
defendants brought into the morals court. It is not that there is any greater percentage
of immorality, but prostitution among whites was more clandestine.

O. J. Milliken, superintendent, Chicago and Cook County School for Delinquent
Boys:

<div class="blockquot">

I don't think that homosexual relations are a racial matter with the boys. The
sex problem, I think, doesn't manifest itself between races as much as it does in the

<h4>
4. LYING AND STEALING
</h4>

<p>
Judge Daniel P. Trude:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I think the colored man, if he is not a desirable citizen, is undesirable because
he has not been given a chance; he has not been given the advantages that a white
fellow has from birth." Judge Trude agreed with the view expressed in a question
that if the Negro were found careless as to the truth and as to his promises, it was due
to his heredity and lack of training rather than anything inherently bad in him.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Wells M. Cook:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think there is a great deal of nonsense in the talk about the colored man being
more apt to lie or steal than the white man. I think that is largely a question of
environment and training. He is not more inclined, in my judgment, to tell a lie
or steal than a white man.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Charles M. Thomson:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I would say there is a far larger number of larceny cases involving the white
than the colored man, even in proportion to the population. The larger proportion
of cases involving the colored is in having to do with fights, involving murder in some
instances.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Edmund Jarecki:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
No, I don't think Negroes are more likely to be guilty of theft than whites;
that is not usually the case.

<h4>
5. TYPES OF NEGRO CRIMES
</h4>

<p>
Judge Hugo Pam:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The colored man is frequently charged with robbery with a gun, and a great
many have guns. Relatively speaking, more colored men have guns than white men.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Kickham Scanlan:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The most prevalent crimes or types of crimes amongst Negroes, according to
my observation, are gambling, assault cases, caused by drinking or women, petty
theft.
</p>
</div>

<p>
F. Emory Lyon, superintendent, Central Howard Association:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My experience in dealing with colored offenders would indicate a slightly larger
proportion of crimes of violence than in the case of white men.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Dr. Clara Hayes, Geneva School for Delinquent Girls:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think there is a little more tendency on the part of colored inmates toward
violence than there is among white girls. I mean such misconduct as attacks on
other girls, etc.

<h4>
6. MENTAL
</h4>

<p>
Judge Daniel P. Trude:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I today received a letter from a young colored man who has been in the boys'
court several times. His father is a mental defective, and he is a mental defective.
That is the reason he keeps committing these crimes. He is in the Dixon Home for
Feeble Minded. There are a number of colored boys that come up from the South
that way, and it is my judgment that southern institutions are turning them loose.
I think Illinois does as well as other states. They all discharge mental defectives
as cured, and they wander all over the face of the earth, in and out of other institutions.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Charles M. Thomson:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
As a rule the mentality of colored offenders was not high. I had a few cases
where the reverse was true, and one which involved a man who was as smart a man
as I ever tried.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mary Bartelme, associate judge of the juvenile court:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
As to mentality, I would say that in recent years we have had a large number
of girls who have come up to Chicago from the South and their educations have not
been equal to the educations of the white girls and their mental development has not
been the same.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Dr. Herman Adler:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
At Pontiac we find in general that the average of intelligence in the colored
people is rather less than in the whites. Take the white people separately and you
will find about the same proportion of low grades as in the colored race. In actual
group comparison, the colored race is somewhat below that of the whites. That is,
in general the distribution is about the same, but there is always a slight lag of the
colored below the white. The lower the intelligence, on the whole, the more likely
it is that the individual is in the institution for a crime of violence or a sex crime or
incendiarism; the higher the intelligence, the more likely that the crime is forgery or
some crime involving fraud.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
7. CHANGE IN CHARACTER OF CRIME OR INCREASE IN CRIME
DUE TO MIGRATION
</h4>

<p>
Judge Hugh Stewart:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I am of the impression that the colored men from the South are in the courts in
larger numbers than are those who have lived here a long time.... A great many
of the colored people from the South are very dark skinned, and there is a larger
proportion, in my estimation, of offenses among dark-skinned colored people than
among those of the light color. I sometimes try to trace out where they come from.
I find a great many of these cases come from the South.
</p>

<p>
I think there is a difference between offenses committed by colored persons from
the South and colored persons who have resided for a long time in the North. I think
there are more hold-ups and burglaries committed by men who come from the South
than by the colored population before the influx.
</p>

<p>
I am of the opinion that Negroes who have recently come from the South and
find their way into the police courts do not typify or reflect the general character of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' name='Page_350' href='#Page_350'>350</a></span>
the southern Negroes as a class, any more than the white people who find their way
into the police courts typify other whites who manage to keep out of them.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Daniel P. Trude:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It was frequently true that the boys would jump freights from down South and
come up here and be picked up and brought into court and be left in jail for a while
with nobody to keep after them, or furnish bail. The South has never given the
Negro adequate educational advantages, so they come up here more or less uneducated,
many of them, and they are not given a helping hand as they should be.
</p>

<p>
In the boys' court the number of southern boys recently arrived in Chicago
was startling. While I was in the boys' court, I made it a practice to give every
one of them a card to the Urban League, so that they would know where to go to
get advice on any difficulty.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Wells M. Cook:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I would say that of the colored men and women brought into court in the summer
of 1918, the greater percentage were colored people who had recently come to Chicago.
In most instances the colored man brought in had money; he was receiving more
wages than in the South; the city was "wet"; he had come from districts in the
South where he could not get whiskey; in a great many instances he had not brought
his wife and family with him, so he was easy prey for those engaged in commercial
sexual vice. In consequence he would be arrested in these raids, made usually by
the police on the night when the underworld was supposed to be the busiest, usually
Saturday and Sunday nights. I do not think there are any more vicious colored
men than there are vicious white men, but the colored man who was brought in largely
was a newcomer. There had been no particular increase in vice that I observed
among the native-born colored people or the man who had come to Chicago a reasonable
number of years back. As to the women, they were almost entirely typical
southern prostitutes, who had come here from New Orleans, Memphis, Nashville,
Atlanta, Galveston, and other large cities in the South, attracted to Chicago by reason
of the fact there were a lot of colored men up here who were making good money.
I would say that so far as the colored women of Chicago were concerned, there was
no noticeable increase in immorality among them.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. O. J. Milliken:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In 1919, we ran up to 15 per cent colored. This year, 1920, it is less than 7
per cent. The reason is found in the boys from the South. They have stopped
coming now and we are getting back to normal. The boys from the South have
been very illiterate. We have received a number who could not write their own names
and would almost be counted subnormal on first examination but are often found to
be very bright. A great many asked to come back or asked to remain in the institution
until they could get some education. I never noticed any difference as to color in
the handling of the boys in any department.

<h4>
8. LIABILITY OF THE NEGRO TO ARREST
</h4>

<p>
Judge Daniel P. Trude:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think that at the time of the riot there was more disposition on the part of the
officers to make arrests of colored offenders, frequently for protection. I think it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' name='Page_351' href='#Page_351'>351</a></span>
was due to what Dr. Shepardson used to call, out at the University, "the mind of
the mob"â€”a disturbed view of things which makes one likely to go too far one way
or the other. These people were that way. They had to arrest a certain number
and try to check the riot, and they went too far in many cases.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Charles M. Thomson:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have seen cases where Negroes were arrested on suspicion; I would not say there
was any large proportion. I remember one case was a young colored fellow arrested
purely on suspicion. The jury disagreed the first time. The next time he was tried
before me, and the jury found him guilty. Because it was a second trial, and because
of the disagreement, I watched it very carefully as the evidence went in, and I became
convinced that it was a pure case of the officers having had some trouble with this
fellow before. A crime occurred in their district, and they pounced on this chap.
I felt pretty sure he was not guilty. The state's attorney called the trial off. He
became convinced himself.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. O. J. Milliken:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
After a boy has been committed by the juvenile court, he is known to the police,
and I have four or five colored boys today who are carrying letters from me asking
that the police will please allow these boys to go to work. Prejudice on the part of
the police in picking up alleged offenders is more apt to occur against Negroes than
whites.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Kickham Scanlan:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Negroes are more likely to be arrested on suspicion than white persons. If
you will tell me why race prejudice exists in this world, I will tell you why this is so.
I don't think the police are quite as careful with reference to the rights of the colored
man as with the white man. I think they hesitate a little longer when a white man
is involved; I am certain that it is so.
</p>
</div>

<p>
State's Attorney Maclay Hoyne:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In the race riots, the police arrested almost exclusively Negroes, and practically
no white men.
</p>
</div>

<p>
General Leroy T. Steward:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Recently there have come to Chicago from the South large numbers of colored
men who have formerly lived in the country and are not accustomed to city environments.
These men have largely been employed at the Stock Yards and, being
unknown to the police, there is concerning them naturally a greater suspicion than
would attach to the white man who had lived for a greater length of time in the same
district, and who also would be more easily identified and traced, if need be, and he
would not, therefore, perhaps, be arrested but simply be observed, while the police
would, no doubt, feel if they permitted the colored man to pass on at the time, they
would lose him completely. This would seem to me to be the real basis of the feeling
that has maintained on the part of these men, that they are discriminated against
as compared with the whites.
</p>

<p>
Another matter in this same connection that no doubt has a bearing on the
subject is that these same men who have been accustomed to rather close surveillance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_352' name='Page_352' href='#Page_352'>352</a></span>
in the South, seem to feel that when they come to the North they must conduct
themselves in a manner to evidence to all concerned that they have equal rights
of every kind and character, with the result that they sometimes are guilty of unnecessarily
accentuating these matters, and thus bringing on disputes which occasion bad
feeling and perhaps lead to disturbances resulting in arrest.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Dr. Herman C. Adler:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Repeatedly colored men have been convicted on evidence which I know perfectly
well would not have been satisfactory in white cases. I know that was so in the case
of the East St. Louis riot where a colored man was sent down to the Southern Illinois
Penitentiary for participating in the riots on the charge of murder. Even the prosecuting
office, on reviewing the facts, a year later, admitted he did not believe the
evidence sufficient. If that had been a white man the chances are that he would
not have been convicted upon that evidence.
</p>

<p>
We had the same thing here in Chicago: a colored man sent to the penitentiary
on a charge of attempted rape where the identification was made by a child of six or
eight years who picked him out of a crowd under suspicion. No such evidence ought
to be accepted. We know there is prejudice, and when there is prejudice we know
the person against whom the prejudice is directed has a hard time.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
9. DISCRIMINATION IN THE COURTS
</h4>

<p>
Judge Daniel P. Trude:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think in the main the Negro gets as good a show as the white man when he gets
before the judge. Whether the other forces before he gets up to that point treat
him right or not, I cannot say.... A certain number of policemen have "got it
in" for him and are going to "take a crack" at him because he is a colored man.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Hugo Pam:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In a murder case lawyers will challenge a Negro; if there were a colored man
in the box he would soon be put out.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Charles M. Thomson:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Take for example a gun case, with twelve men in the box, and one a colored man,
and suppose that the lawyer challenged the Negro. If you went to the lawyer and
said, "Give me your reason," I don't think he would give you any reason....
If you had a case where the defendant was colored that juror would stay in the
box so far as the defendant was concerned.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Kickham Scanlan:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Of course there is another thing about the colored man in the criminal court
that must be kept in mind. It is a peculiar thing about human nature, that no
man wants to admit that he has prejudices. He will talk loosely on the outside
that he doesn't like the Negro, or doesn't like the Jew, or doesn't like this person or
that person, but you get him under oath in the jury box and in my twelve years on
the bench I never knew a juror to admit that he was prejudiced against anybody.
It goes without saying that in such a state of affairs you will probably get men on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' name='Page_353' href='#Page_353'>353</a></span>
the juries that try colored men who have some prejudice against Negroes. I would
say that when there is a colored defendant and white prosecuting witness there
would be grave danger that the jury might unconsciously favor the white side of the
case. Juries will convict a colored man with less hesitation than they will convict
a white man on the same kind of evidence. For that reason, in the many cases in
which the colored man is involved, I watch the evidence like a hawk. The verdict
has got to pass me.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
10. EASE WITH WHICH NEGROES ARE CONVICTED
</h4>

<p>
Judge George Kersten, criminal court:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There is unfortunately a difference in the ease or difficulty with which white and
colored persons brought into court are convicted, and the misfortune operates
adversely towards colored people. In many cases jurors have been excused from
service because upon examination under oath to test their qualifications to act as
jurors they said they could not give a colored person a fair trial. In my experience
I have known verdicts to be set aside by the presiding judge, because he was convinced
that the jury was influenced by color prejudice. As to the prosecution of colored
offenders by white plaintiffs and white offenders by colored plaintiffs, I believe that
the influence of color prejudice is sometimes felt in our courts. I think it is easier
under similar facts and circumstances in evidence to convict a colored defendant
than a white one. And for the same reason, a white person on trial is less liable
to conviction if the prosecuting witnesses are all colored. Perhaps an enlightening
phase of the whole situation is to be found in the fact that colored offenders, on being
brought in for trial, usually ask to be tried by the judge instead of a jury.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Hugo Pam:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In light cases involving pocket-picking, larceny, stealing a bag of sugar, a barrel
of flour, clothing, etc., I think the races stand on an equality, but in a serious offense
I think the colored man has the less chance. I feel that the colored man starts with
a handicap. I haven't any question about it in my mind. In the more serious crimes,
where a hold-up is committed or guns are used, I think there is great prejudice. I think
very few white or colored men are convicted that shouldn't be; no judge would
allow such a case to stand if he thinks there has been unfair trial, but, for instance,
where a white man will be found guilty of manslaughter, a colored man will be found
guilty of murder. A white man might escape with three to twenty years in the penitentiary,
while the colored man would get ten years to life.
</p>

<p>
I think the colored man would not be convicted if he is not guilty, but I am not
certain that the white man would be convicted if he is guilty.
</p>

<p>
I see colored men, very resigned men, very often feeling that most people are not
interested in them. They come and take their medicine, and go away. I feel that
they are being disposed of without the interest being shown that should be.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
11. LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR NEGRO DEFENDANTS
</h4>

<p>
Judge Daniel P. Trude:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My experience in court work is that Negro lawyers in the main lack education
such as is necessary, but there are among the members of the bar some very good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' name='Page_354' href='#Page_354'>354</a></span>
colored attorneys. Many Negroes cannot afford to pay the attorney's fees necessary
to obtain these, so that they are handicapped in court by lack of competent counsel,
and it becomes necessary for the judge to give them more careful hearings and more
careful consideration to protect their interests.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Wells M. Cook:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The handicap that the colored man seems to be under in the severe cases is that
he frequently does not get a good lawyer. As a rule he is not represented by as good
a lawyer as the white. Of course there are capable Negro lawyers in Chicago, but
there were few such retained in the cases tried before me.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Hugo Pam:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I do not think that Negroes have as able lawyers as whites. I had a case of a
colored man who I felt was misrepresented instead of represented. He was convicted
of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. I felt that the sentence was too
severe. I set it aside and granted a new trial and it resulted in a verdict of manslaughter
which was the thing that should have been done.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Kickham Scanlan:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Negro hasn't the money to employ proper attorneys, competent attorneys.
In two out of three cases tried before me in which there were colored defendants,
I have appointed attorneys to defend them. I appointed white attorneys. I asked
the defendants whom they wanted. They told me and I appointed the white lawyers
mentioned and made them serve.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
12. IDENTIFICATION
</h4>

<p>
Judge Daniel P. Trude:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I did find where certain of the police were going into Negro clubs and arresting
Negroes they found there, bringing them into court without a bit of evidence of any
offense. Somebody would tip off the police that there was gambling going on so
they would raid the place, locking up all the men they found there for the night and
send them to the Bureau of Identification, but that was all. Some policemen take
many people to the Bureau of Identification who absolutely should not be taken there,
but the judge only knows about it after they have been taken there, when they are
brought into court after the damage has been done.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
13. PROBATION ON PAROLE
</h4>

<p>
Dr. F. Emory Lyon, superintendent, Central Howard Association:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In dealing with colored men on parole, our experience has been that fully as
large a proportion have completed their parole with credit as in the case of white
men under parole. I should say that the task of securing employment has been less
difficult because colored men as a rule have been less critical as to the kind of employment
they would accept. They have been willing to make an honest living at any
work that is offered.
</p>
</div>

<p>
John L. Whitman, superintendent of state prisons:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have seen many colored men, young men or boys, who gave every evidence of a
sincere desire to do well on the outside. They meet with disappointment that they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' name='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
did not expect, hardships, difficulty in securing work as well as homes, and they fall.
The desire was there just the same. The opportunities were not. But when the
employer gives him a chance, the Negro appreciates it and he sticksâ€”and we have
had employers say during the last year many times, "If you have got such colored
men as you have sent before, give them to us in preference to the whites, because
there is a lack of appreciation on the part of white men."
</p>
</div>

<h4>
14. ENVIRONMENT: VICE IN NEGRO RESIDENCE AREAS
</h4>

<p>
General Leroy T. Steward:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Where Negroes have come in and as a result white people have moved out
and the neighborhood has, plainly speaking, deteriorated, there is a great tendency
to permit infractions of the law, as in any neighborhoods which are regarded as not
as important as high-class residence neighborhoods. For instance, Calumet Avenue
from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth streets is entirely colored. Fifteen years ago it
was entirely white. Now it would be much easier to establish vice there than it would
have been fifteen years ago when a lot of well-known people lived in the neighborhood.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Major L. M. C. Funkhouser:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Most of the Negroes found in disorderly houses are employees. There was one
notorious place down there that we closed where they were all colored. That was
the most notorious one we had.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Professor Charles E. Merriam:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think there is this to be said about the colored side of it there [on the South
Side]: I am asked whether the colored protest against disorderly resorts would be as
effective as a protest made by an equal number of white men. Making allowance
for the fluctuating conditions in a long period, I don't believe it would be quite as
effective. Not only that, but I don't think the colored people are so well organized
to fight these evils as a class of men ... they have not the wealth. In the territory
upon the North Side or in any territory where there are many lawyers and people
of some means, if they found a place like that they would never rest until they got
it out. They would just keep at it with time and money until they forced it out.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Dr. F. Emory Lyon, superintendent, Central Howard Association:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Our observation would indicate that the Negro delinquent has suffered under
the handicap of unsatisfactory home conditions. Owing to the general public discrimination,
fewer opportunities have been offered him. In addition to adverse
conditions in the home, some opportunities in public places have been denied him.
Some of the discrimination and ostracism on the part of his associates has been unconscious
in many instances. The colored boy has especially few recreational facilities.

<p>
Mr. O. J. Milliken:

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is up to us to give them the best that there is, and we can clean up those districts.

<p>
Myron Adams, former pastor of the First Baptist Church:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
North of my church for a block or two along Thirty-first Street at the time
I went there was almost exclusively a white residence district. The moral conditions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' name='Page_356' href='#Page_356'>356</a></span>
could not have been worse. I had a list in my church study of the houses of prostitution
and other lawless agencies gathered by the police and the Committee of Fifteen.
I don't know of a district in Chicago where there were more gunmen, more high-class
criminals, more high-class prostitutes than there were within three blocks of the First
Baptist Church when I came there as pastor.
</p>

<p>
Speaking from my observation I think that any colored community is liable to
be imposed upon by white men who are vicious, and the colored people get no encouragement
when they themselves endeavor to rout out that vice. White prostitutes
and white gamblers and vicious resorts come into the "Black Belt" because it is
black; they operate with more safety than they do in the white belt. That is true
of every American city that I know of personally.

<h4>
15. ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL ASPECTS OF NEGRO CRIME
</h4>

<p>
Judge Charles M. Thomson:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Colored people who were up before me in the criminal court were mostly men
who did not have steady employment.... My experience was that the environmental
conditions out of which the colored defendant arose were an environment of
idleness, very largely. I would say, as to the economic factors, that I don't remember
a case that I had involving a colored defendant whom I would call prosperous, whereas
there were many white defendants who were very prosperous. Most of the colored
people tried were in stringent circumstances and poverty.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Judge Kickham Scanlan:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My experience in the criminal court is that the colored defendant, even in bailable
cases, is unable to give bail. He has to stay in jail, and therefore his case is very
quickly disposed of by the prosecutor. Defendants locked up are usually tried first.
The colored man is more apt to be out of work than the white man, and that is a
possible reason for the large number of arrests of Negroes. His sphere is very limited,
and if there is any let up in the industry that is involved in that sphere, he is a victim.
I have often wondered if you could change the skins of a thousand white men
in the city of Chicago and handicap them the way the colored man is handicapped
today, how many of those white men in ten years' time would be law-abiding
citizens.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Professor Charles E. Merriam:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
This problem as I see it is very complicated. We have to deal first with the matter
of economic class which is at the bottom of a good deal of it, then with the matter of
race, which is at the bottom of a good deal more of it, although perhaps not as much
as class; then there is the matter of politics or a system which has grown up for
thirty or forty years back, which makes the class and race relations a good deal
more difficult to deal with.
</p>

<p>
If every man had good housing conditions and a steady job, at a living wage, a
good opportunity for education, there would not be very much crime.... Particularly
in the case of the colored people, the crime is on the part of the community,
on the part of the city that allows bad conditions to exist. Negroes ought to be
protected. They don't get protection for the same reason that it is always hard to
protect the economically weak against the strong. There is not any use of making
a lot of fine phrases about itâ€”that is largely where the trouble lies.

<br />
<span class="s08">THE NEGRO IN INDUSTRY</span>
</h2>

<h3>
A. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CONDITIONS
</h3>

<h4>
I. INTRODUCTION
</h4>

<h5>
1. NEGRO WORKING POPULATION IN 1920
</h5>

<p>
Between 1910 and 1920 the Negro population of Chicago increased from
44,103 to 109,594. Of this number it is estimated that about 70,000 were
engaged in industries in 1920 as compared with about 27,000 in 1910.<a name='FA_49' id='FA_49' href='#FN_49' class='fnanchor'>[49]</a>
</p>

<p>
Questions which naturally suggest themselves for answer in connection
with this great increase in the Negro working population in Chicago are:
How did this large number of Negroes fit into the industrial life of the city?
What were and are the opportunities open to them? Have they given satisfaction
to employers? Are they discriminated against by employers or
fellow-workers? Has racial friction developed because of competition between
white and Negro workers? Were the riots of 1919 in any sense the result of
labor troubles? What part have the Negroes taken in strikes? What is
the relation of the Negro to organized labor? What is the outlook for the
Negro in industry? These and other questions guided the inquiries and
investigations of the Commission in the industrial field.
</p>

<h5>
2. OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY THE WAR
</h5>

<p>
The Negro's position in the industrial life of Chicago is so intimately connected
with the changes due to the war that a brief reference to certain facts
of common knowledge in connection with the war will be helpful. With the
beginning of the war in 1914 came an abnormally large demand by the belligerent
countries for American munitions, food products, clothing, leather, iron
and steel products, and other manufactured goods. Existing establishments
were enlarged and new ones were erected in response to the demand for
increased production. It was not uncommon for a plant to double or treble
its labor force. A typical case was one of the large packing-plants in the
Chicago "Yards" which increased its workers during the war from 8,000 to
17,000.
</p>

<p>
The war stimulated the demand for goods, and therefore for labor, and at
the same time decreased the available labor supply. Immigration from the
belligerent nations immediately ceased, and there was a marked decrease in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_358' name='Page_358' href='#Page_358'>358</a></span>
immigration from other countries; aliens in large numbers departed to join
the fighting forces of their native lands.
</p>

<p>
The labor shortage became acute soon after the United States entered the
war in 1917, and enlistments withdrew hundreds of thousands of men from
northern industries. An unprecedented demand for Negro workers was the
result. The migration from the South was mainly a response to the call of
larger opportunity and higher wages in the North.
</p>

<p>
In 1910, more than three-fourths of the gainfully occupied Negroes in
the United States were engaged in two forms of industryâ€”agriculture and
domestic and personal service. In the South at that time 78.8 per cent of the
Negro population lived in rural communities<a name='FA_51' id='FA_51' href='#FN_51' class='fnanchor'>[51]</a> and 62 per cent of those employed
were engaged in agriculture.<a name='FA_52' id='FA_52' href='#FN_52' class='fnanchor'>[52]</a> It is evident, therefore, that the northward
migration involved a sudden transition of the southern Negro from farms or
small towns to the highly specialized industries of northern cities, with marked
changes in modes of living.
</p>

<p>
On many southern plantations the Negroes were required to buy food and
clothing on credit at such high prices that their shares of the return were
usually spent before the crops were harvested.<a name='FA_53' id='FA_53' href='#FN_53' class='fnanchor'>[53]</a> This system encouraged
careless spending and did nothing to induce habits of thrift. Even the hardest-working
Negroes frequently found themselves in debt to their landlords at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_359' name='Page_359' href='#Page_359'>359</a></span>
end of the year.<a name='FA_54' id='FA_54' href='#FN_54' class='fnanchor'>[54]</a> Incentive to sustained effort and regular work was lacking
in the hand-to-mouth existence under this prevailing system of share rent and
credit. It naturally produced habits such as drawing against wages and working
irregularly under the spur of temporary need. Men handicapped by such
habits joined the migration in great numbers. Though ill-fitted for the keen
competition, business-like precision, and six-day-week routine of northern
industry, the southern Negro, in spite of these handicaps, has succeeded in
Chicago.
</p>

<h4>
II. THE NEGRO IN CHICAGO INDUSTRIES IN 1910 AND 1920
</h4>

<p>
Of the Negro population of 44,103 in Chicago in 1910 the gainfully
occupied numbered 27,317. The distribution of this number, according to
industrial classification, is given in Table XIX, which shows that 60 per cent of
all such Negroes were engaged in domestic and personal service, as compared
with 15 per cent in manufacturing and 3 per cent in clerical occupations.

<h5>
1. METHOD AND SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION
</h5>

<p>
To discover the industries in Chicago which were employing Negroes in
appreciable numbers in 1920, preliminary questionnaires were sent to 850
employers compiled from lists furnished by: (1) the Chicago Association of
Commerce (covering 591 establishments, with a total of 350,000 employees);
(2) the Employment Department of the Chicago Urban League; (3) the
Illinois Free Employment Bureau; (4) the Federal Employment Bureau; and
(5) the classified telephone directory.
</p>

<p>
Questionnaires were returned by 460 establishments of 850 to which they
were mailed. We are satisfied that the replies received cover the field of Negro
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_360' name='Page_360' href='#Page_360'>360</a></span>
labor, and that no establishments of importance in this field have been overlooked.
Table XX shows the results:

<p>
Answers came from 156 manufacturing establishments employing fifty-one
or more wage-earners. The representative character of this group is
indicated by the fact that over three-fourths of the total wage-earners in
Chicago engaged in manufacturing in 1914 were employed in factories of this
class. The United States Census of Manufactures for 1914 reported the total
number of wage-earners employed in manufacturing in Chicago in that year
as 313,710; of this number, 244,827, or 78 per cent, were employed in 1,032
establishments employing fifty-one or more wage-earners. The 156 questionnaires
therefore represented 15 per cent of the 1,032 establishments in this
class (in 1914) and included 107,403 wage-earners, or almost 44 per cent of
the total wage-earners in this class and 30 per cent of the total wage-earners
engaged in manufacturing in 1914.
</p>

<p>
Questionnaires reporting Negro employees were returned by 104 manufacturing
establishments of all classes. Of these, sixteen employed one to fifty wage-earners,
representing a total of 435 wage-earners; and eighty-eight employed
fifty-one or more wage-earners, representing a total of 78,919 wage-earners.
</p>

<p>
Since thirty-five of the manufacturing establishments reporting Negro
labor (or 33 per cent of the 104 so reporting) employed less than five Negroes
each, or a total of seventy Negroes in all, while sixty-nine employed 12,854
Negroes, or 99.4 per cent of the total Negroes reported by manufacturing
establishments, it seemed advisable in this report to consider only those
employing five Negroes or more, in order not to give undue weight to conditions
where only a relatively few Negroes were concerned. A similar situation
was disclosed by the returns furnished by non-manufacturing establishments,
and the returns from twenty-four employing a total of forty-one Negroes have
been disregarded in this report in order to give proper weight to conditions in
the sixty-eight employing five or more Negroes which reported a total of 9,483
Negroes.<a name='FA_56' id='FA_56' href='#FN_56' class='fnanchor'>[56]</a> The combined number of establishments, both manufacturing (69)
and non-manufacturing (68), employing five or more Negroes each was 137.

120 INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS
EMPLOYING 24,286 NEGROES</p>
</div>

<p>
On the basis of the returns reported in the preliminary questionnaires
certain establishments and industries were selected for more intensive study
through personal interviews with employers, conferences participated in by
employers and members of the Commission, and interviews with employees.
The basis on which the selection was made was either the number of Negroes
employed or the length of time during which Negroes had been employed,
special attention being given to those industries and establishments which
had employed Negro labor for the first time since the war. The industries
employing large numbers of Negro workers which were selected for further
study were: slaughtering, meat packing, and other food products; iron foundries
and iron and steel products; laundries; needle trades; hotels; railroads;
Pullman and dining-car services; tanneries; taxicab upkeep and repair;
mail order.
</p>

<p>
An investigator for the Commission visited 101 establishments of the 137
reporting five or more Negro employees (ten establishments employing less
than five Negroes each were also visited). Four industrial conferences or
informal hearings were held by the Commission, large employers of Negro
labor being invited to co-operate with the Commission by giving it the benefit
of their experience with Negro labor. Among those who reported were general
superintendents, assistant superintendents, employment managers, and other
representatives of the large employers of Negro labor in Chicago as shown in

<h5>
3. INCREASE IN NEGRO LABOR SINCE 1915
</h5>

<p>
The data obtained from questionnaires, interviews, and conferences with
employers disclosed the fact that there has been a remarkable increase since
1915 in the number of Negro workers employed in manufacturing, in clerical
occupations, and in laundries. As was to be expected, the number of Negroes
in personal service (hotels, dining-cars, and parlor-cars) also increased, but
the increase was negligible in comparison with the gain in the other fields
mentioned.
</p>

<p>
Inability to obtain competent white workers was the reason given in
practically every instance for the large increase in the number of Negroes
employed since 1914. All of the large employers of Negro labor attending the
conferences assigned shortage of labor as the principal reason for the increased
number of Negroes reported. A few establishments (not represented in the
conferences) reported that Negroes had first been employed to take the place
of strikers, and increasing numbers had been employed thereafter. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_363' name='Page_363' href='#Page_363'>363</a></span>
establishments so reporting were hotels, a small clothing factory, and a warehouse
company. Because of the labor shortage in the North, large numbers of
Negroes left the southern states.

4. CHICAGO EMPLOYERS AND SOUTHERN NEGRO LABOR
</h5>

<p>
During the course of its inquiry the statement was frequently made to
members of the Commission or to its investigators that large employers of
labor in Chicago, and particularly the packers, had imported many Negroes
from the South. Although the Commission made a thorough investigation
of such statements, no evidence of any value was discovered to support them.
</p>

<p>
The general superintendents of the Armour, Morris, Swift, and Wilson
plants who attended conferences declared emphatically that their companies
had not engaged in any encouragement of migration.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_364' name='Page_364' href='#Page_364'>364</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor,
being asked through correspondence from the Commission if he could furnish
any evidence tending to prove the importation of Negroes into the Chicago
district by employers, replied, "There is a plentitude of such evidence," but
when Mr. Gompers was urged to cite the evidence, his reply was: "It cannot be
unknown to you that some 30,000 Negroes were imported into the Chicago
district during the steel strike. They did not go there of their own volition,
but through inducements which were held out to them by the agents of
employers who visited southern and western cities."
</p>

<p>
As, however, the Chicago race riot occurred a year prior to the steel strike,
importation of Negroes at the latter time could not have affected the situation
out of which the riot came. But the fact remains that labor leaders insist
that employers in the Chicago district imported Negroes from the South,
notwithstanding their inability to cite facts in support of this belief.
</p>

<h5>
5. CLASSIFICATION OF NEGRO WORKERS
</h5>

<p>
An accurate classification of Negro laborers into skilled, semi-skilled, and
unskilled would help to an understanding of the position of the Negro in
industry. In manufacturing, such a classification was attempted, but the
results were unsatisfactory. These classes cannot be strictly defined, and
different employers give them different meanings. In a number of important
cases employers reported the total number of skilled and unskilled, and that
figures for each class could not be compiled without great labor. In all such
cases the total is listed as "unskilled." This class is thus unduly enlarged at
the expense of the semi-skilled and the skilled. So the number of semi-skilled
workers appears to be less than the skilled. These facts show that accuracy
cannot be claimed for the classification in Table XXV.

<p>
The attempt to classify Negro workers according to occupation failed
because the necessary information was not obtainable, especially from large
employers. Nevertheless the number of workers in certain occupations
reported by a few establishments is suggestive of the fields recently opened to
Negroes in Chicago. In 1910<a name='FA_66' id='FA_66' href='#FN_66' class='fnanchor'>[66]</a> there were only thirty-one Negro molders in
Chicago, while in 1920 there were 304 reported by ten establishments. In
1910 there were but twenty-eight factory sewers or machine operators, while
in 1920 there were 382 in twelve factories. In 1910 there were 934 Negroes
employed in clerical occupations as compared with 1,400 in two concerns in
1920. In 1910 there were but 287 Negro laundry operatives in Chicago,
while there were 764 reported by twenty laundries in 1920.
</p>

<h5>
6. WAGES OF NEGRO WORKERS
</h5>

<p>
The period of this industrial investigationâ€”the spring and summer of
1920â€”was one of exceptional demand for labor and of high wages. Employers
were glad to get workers of any sort at high pay.<a name='FA_67' id='FA_67' href='#FN_67' class='fnanchor'>[67]</a> In branches of employment
where Negroes were permitted to work, their wages were generally the same as
those of the white workers. In interviewing many Negro workers the Commission's
investigators found practically no complaints of discrimination in
wages on the same tasks. And the Chicago Urban League which, through
its industrial department, places more Negroes in employment than any other
agency in Chicago reported that it had very few complaints of such
discrimination.
</p>

<p>
Some discrimination was practiced by foremen in placing or keeping
Negroes at work on processes that yielded smaller returns than those to which
white workers were assigned. In the field of common labor, where the largest
number of Negroes are employed, some kinds of piecework yield greater
returns than others. The tendency of foremen in some plants was to place
Negroes on those processes yielding the smallest returns. The following are
instances of such discrimination in favor of the white workers in the same
plants.
</p>

<p>
In two large foundries white molders were given standard patterns, which
remain the same throughout the year and permit the working up of speed;
while patterns that were changed frequently, and made production slower were
given to the Negroes. As speed determined the piecework earnings, the
Negroes could not earn as much as the white molders in the same foundry.
</p>

<p>
In the several plants the white workers were favored in the distribution
of overtime work; or Negroes were not permitted to work at all on overtime
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' name='Page_366' href='#Page_366'>366</a></span>
at "time and a half" rates or on Sundays at "double pay" as long as white
workers were available.
</p>

<p>
While in the larger industries there was seldom any complaint about
inequality in the basic rate of pay for common labor, restrictions upon the
promotion and advancement of Negroes frequently prevented them from earning
higher wages. In one department of a large food-products plant Negroes
reached the maximum rate of 61 cents per hour after a few months' employment.
No further advancement could be had because the superintendent was
not willing to place Negro foremen over white workers. A Negro in the starch-mixing
department held a skilled position as starch tester. It became apparent
that in carrying out his duties many of the starch mixers would be subject to
his immediate direction. The foreman apparently did not approve of this
and ordered him to teach his duties to a Polish workman. The Negro declined
to do this, and the matter was referred to the general superintendent. After
an investigation it was decided to permit the Negro to retain his position as
tester, but he was given no authority over the men.
</p>

<p>
In view of the fluctuations in wages, the impracticability of getting actual
records of wages from all plants, and the discrepancies which in some instances
did appear between reported and actual wages, it seemed desirable to supplement
the information of the Commission's investigators. The records of the
industrial department of the Chicago Urban League afforded the most complete
data on wages received by Negroes that could be found in Chicago. During
the year 1919 it placed more than 14,000 Negroes in plants in the Chicago
District. In each case, when securing Negro employment, it kept a record
of the wages actually offered and of conditions of work. If the Negro made
complaint that the wage or work conditions did not prove to be as stated, it
investigated the complaint.
</p>

<p>
Included in these records are the Pullman Company, Wilson &amp; Company
(packers), Armour &amp; Company, Morris Company, Swift &amp; Company, Illinois
Malleable Iron Company, National Malleable and Castings Company, International
Harvester Company, the General Can Company, the Republic Box
Company, Chicago Fire Brick Company, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, Superior
Process Company, Consumers Coal Company, Corn Products Refining Company
at Argo, United States Quartermasters' Department, Adams &amp; Westlake
Company, Griess Pfleger Tanning Company, and Inland Steel Company.
</p>

<p>
In the industries listed above, the minimum wage rate per hour is 42.5
cents, which is the minimum rate for the packing industries. The maximum
rate is sixty-one cents per hour paid by the Corn Products Refining Company
at Argo and the International Harvester Company. Neither of the latter,
however, represents a basic wage. The average wage for the thirty-six companies
is 48.7 cents. These wage rates cover the most arduous tasks found in
the list of common labor. Three items for track laborers are included. Others
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_367' name='Page_367' href='#Page_367'>367</a></span>
include freight handlers, yardmen, truckers, sweepers, foundry laborers, etc.
Six companies work ten hours per day, twelve companies nine hours, one
company nine and one-half hours, seventeen companies eight hours. Four pay
bonuses, not including packers, who also pay a bonus in compliance with the
award of a judge acting as mediator between the packers and the union.
</p>

<p>
The building trades are not included, but of the three independent contractors
listed the wage paid common laborers is 50 cents per hour, 60 cents
per hour, and 70 cents per hour, respectively, for eight hours, while the union
rate of pay for common labor is $1.00 per hour for eight hours, time and one-half
for overtime, and double time for Sunday.
</p>

<h5>
7. WOMEN EMPLOYEES IN INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENTS
</h5>

<p>
Negro women employed in thirty-one industrial establishments worked,
in five of them forty-four hours a week, in fifteen of them forty-eight hours,
in seven of them forty-nine hours, and in four of them fifty-one hours. The
weekly pay ranged from $9.00 to $15.00 a week as clothing folders, to as high
as $20.00 to $35.00 a week as clothing drapers or finishers. Map mounting
paid $15.00 a week, book binding $15.00, paper-box making $13.00, tobacco
stripping $16.40, core making (foundry work) $16.40, twine weaving $17.40,
silk-shade making $10.00 to $18.00, food packing $12.00 to $15.00, mattress
making $12.00 to $22.00, riveters (canvas) $15.00, paper sorters $12.00, steam
laundry workers (unskilled) $13.00 to $16.00, steam laundry hand workers
$18.00 to $29.00, power-machine operators on men's caps $15.00 to $18.00,
on aprons $14.00 to $18.00, on dresses $15.00 to $18.00, on overalls (union
shop) $18.00 to $25.00, and on overalls (non-union shop) $15.00 to $18.00.
</p>

<p>
Of fourteen companies employing colored girls as operators, five paid on
a piecework basis only. Two paid from $12.00 to $18.00 per week, depending
on the skill of the operator, two companies paid $14.00 per week to beginners,
one paid $15.00 per week to beginners, three paid $12.00 per week to beginners,
one paid $18.00 per week to beginners, the latter being a union shop.
</p>

<p>
Considerable unrest has been traceable to delay on the part of the managers
in promoting beginners above the beginning wage. Girls have been retained
at a beginning wage for an unreasonable time after acquiring satisfactory skill
and production. This condition is known to the Women's Trade Union
League, but no well-directed effort has ever been made to unionize colored
workers in the garment trades, except when they have been called in as strike
breakers to replace white workers. An instance of this was the strike at the
C. B. Shane Company, manufacturers of raincoats, where colored girls were
employed to replace striking white union workers. At that time very few
colored girls were members of the local union. According to an official of the
Women's Garment Workers' Union not more than 125 colored workers have
become members.

<p>
In all of the above-listed occupations the wages are augmented by tips.
It is difficult to form an accurate estimate of the amount earned in tips for the
reason that it is conditioned upon the character of service rendered and the
inclination of the person served to pay for personal service. It would be fair
to estimate that in hotels and restaurants known to employees as "good houses"
the tips range from $2.00 to $5.00 per day. In a colored restaurant in the
neighborhood of Thirty-first and State streets a wage of $5.00 per week is paid
to waitresses, while the tips have been known to total five times that amount.

Chicago Urban League's Industrial Department has records, employ women
in the occupations and at the wages listed as follows:

<p>
In clerical positions colored men have had very little opportunity, except
in the post-office. There are exceptions, however, such as shipping clerks,
storekeepers, and bookkeepers.
</p>

<p>
The girls employed as long-hand entry clerks, typists, checkers, routers,
and Elliott-Fisher and adding-machine operators received during 1920 from
$15.00 to $16.00 as a beginning wage. The chief supervisor (colored) in charge
of 600 girls in one of the large mail-order houses received $23.00 per week, and
the assistant superintendent, a white man, received $50.00 per week while
studying the mail-order business under the chief supervisor. When the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' name='Page_369' href='#Page_369'>369</a></span>
management's attention was called to the inequality, two additional supervisors
were added and the work lessened without increase of pay.
</p>

<p>
Another firm employing several hundred colored girls paid a welfare worker
$20.00 per week, while another with half that number of girls paid $25.00 per
week.
</p>

<p>
There was a deep-seated suspicion existing among the clerical force of a
firm employing a large number of colored girls that the white girls employed
by the same company received a higher wage than that paid the colored girls.
The suspicion grew out of the mistake of an employment manager in mistaking
a colored girl for a white one.
</p>

<h5>
9. RAILROAD WORKERS
</h5>

<p>
<i>Dining-car men.</i>â€”According to the records of the Railway Men's International
Industrial Benevolent Association, wages of dining-car waiters prior
to 1916 were universally $25.00 per month, with the exception of the Santa
Fe, which paid from $35.00 to $40.00 per month for "preferred" runs. The
Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy allowed an additional $3.00 to the $25.00
standard for men in service ten years or more.
</p>

<p>
In 1918, after the roads had been federalized, the minimum wage became
$48.00 per month. In May, 1919, a further increase to $55.00 per month and
overtime on a mileage basis was granted. This gave an average of $62.00
per month for so called "transcontinental" runs, that is, service between
Chicago and the Pacific Coast.
</p>

<p>
Effective February 1, 1920, wages were adjusted to an hourly basis, which
gave payment for overtime in excess of 240 hours per month. On July 20,
1920, most roads allowed a general increase to dining-car men which brought
the average to $65.00 per month.
</p>

<p>
An official of the Railway Men's International Industrial Benevolent
Association estimated that the tips and salary of the average waiter were
$105.00 per month, including three meals valued at 35 cents per day. This
estimate was accepted by the Federal Railway Labor Board. This low estimate
is arrived at because it is generally the custom to feed waiters and kitchen
crews on leftovers which would otherwise become waste.
</p>

<p>
<i>Porters.</i>â€”The wages of porters, including tips, is estimated at $105.00 per
month. The present salary paid to porters is $65.00 per month. In May,
1919, the minimum basis was $60.00 per month on a mileage basis of $.0055
per mile in excess of 11,000 miles per month. In December of the same year
a final adjustment of the wage scale was made in which length of service was
taken as a basis. For three years or less the pay was $63.00 per month; for
from three to ten years the pay was $66.00 per month; for ten years or more
the pay was $69.00 per month. The Railway Men's International Industrial
Benevolent Association furnished the above information.
</p>

<p>
According to the same authority, on January 1, 1921, most roads reduced
the hourly overtime for waiters, cooks, and stewards and placed it on a straight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_370' name='Page_370' href='#Page_370'>370</a></span>
time service, with pay ranging between $60.00 and $65.00 per month. A
twenty-four-day month was also established. This was equal to a reduction
of wages for the class of labor referred to.
</p>

<p>
In the case of thirty-one orders for porters in stores, restaurants, cafÃ©s,
and drugstores, office buildings, etc., the wages ran from $12.00 per week to
$25.00. Some difficulty was experienced in determining a minimum wage,
for the reason that in many instances full time is not required, porters being
allowed to do odd jobs on their own account. Of these thirty-one, three
received $12 a week, one $13, four $15, two $16, one $17, four $18, two $19,
six $20, three $21, one $21.25, one $22 and two $25.
</p>

<p>
Apartment-house janitors usually are affiliated with the labor unions.
An instance of financial benefit is as follows: Fâ€”â€”, who is engineer for an
apartment in Evanston, before joining the union received $45.00 per month
for his services, with quarters in a basement apartment. He now receives
$125.00 per month with the same quarters.
</p>

<p>
Firemen with licenses were offered from $125.00 to $150.00 per month in
ten different positions filled by the League.
</p>

<h5>
10. DOMESTIC WORKERS
</h5>

<p>
Eighty-one orders for maids for service in private families were listed with
the following results: maximum, $18.00 per week with room and board;
minimum, $6.00 per week with room and board; average, $12.84 per week
with room and board. Of these, twenty-six were paid $15, eight $14, twelve
$12, fifteen $10. Three received $18, and one $20.
</p>

<p>
<i>Children's nurses.</i>â€”Fifteen were listed, of whom five were paid $15.00 per
week with room and board, six were paid $12.00, one was paid $7.00, two were
paid $5.00, and one was paid $3.00.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cooks.</i>â€”Sixteen were listed as follows: one was paid $25.00 per week with
room and board, four were paid $18.00, three were paid $16.00, six were paid
$15.00, and two were paid $14.00.
</p>

<p>
The minimum wage for cooks indicated is $14.00 per week with room and
board. The maximum wage is $25.00 per week with room and board, while in
the case of children's nurses the maximum wage is $15.00 per week and the
minimum $3.00 per week for part time.
</p>

<p>
<i>Housemen.</i>â€”Out of a list of twenty-five orders, a minimum of $40.00 per
month with room and board, a maximum of $100.00 per month with room and
board, and an average of $65.00 per month with room and board.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chauffeurs.</i>â€”Minimum of $100.00 per month with room and board and
maximum of $150.00 per month with room and board. It is difficult to outline
the duties of chauffeurs for the reason that they often perform the duties of
butler, houseman, yardman, etc., in addition to that of chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
<i>Couples.</i>â€”(Man and wife.) Out of twenty-five orders listed, the following
wages were offered: minimum of $85.00 per month with room and board.
A maximum of $165.00 per month with room and board.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' name='Page_371' href='#Page_371'>371</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Laundresses.</i>â€”Usually employed by the day. The prevailing rate per
day over the past year was $4.00 and car fare, with one meal. This wage was
asked by common understanding and without any visible form of organization.
Since November 1, 1920, when the unemployment situation became manifest,
$3.60 per day, car fare, and one meal has been accepted.
</p>

<p>
From 1918 to November 1, 1920, a serious shortage of domestic help was
noted. Colored girls and women deserted this grade of work for the factories,
where shorter hours and free Sundays were secured. The larger pay of domestic
employment did not attract the average worker, for the reason that free
evenings for recreation and amusement were apparently more desirable than the
isolation and long hours of domestic service.
</p>

<p>
Recently housekeepers secured Negro girls from the southern states and imported
Negro girls from the British West India Islands<a name='FA_68' id='FA_68' href='#FN_68' class='fnanchor'>[68]</a> in an attempted solution
of the domestic-help problem. Transportation and clothes were furnished by
employers and some sort of verbal agreement entered into by which the girls
were expected to work out this indebtedness. Instances have come to the
attention of the Chicago Urban League which seem to indicate that these
agreements have not worked out satisfactorily. For example: One colored
woman was brought from a small town in Florida to a Chicago suburb by a
white family on such an agreement. After a few weeks' service the employer
complained that the work performed by the woman as a general maid was
unsatisfactory. Abuse followed. The woman sought to go to a Negro family
under the pretence that she wished to return a pair of borrowed shoes. Her
employer, fearing that she wished to escape, drove her to the home of the Negro
family in his automobile. Once inside the home, she told a story of how her
employer had kicked, beaten, and threatened her with a revolver if she
attempted to leave. The Negro family gave asked-for shelter and informed
the employer that she would not return. After threatening to take her away
by force, the employer went away and the woman remained. A suit followed
on a charge of assault and battery and the employer was discharged for lack of
evidence.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks ago a white resident of another Chicago suburb applied to the
juvenile court for the guardianship of a colored girl. The court, being unable
to handle the case, requested the advice of the Chicago Urban League. The
details of the case were substantially as follows:
</p>

<p>
A Roman Catholic organization in Jamaica, British West Indies, sent ten
or twelve Jamaican girls to the United States, upon applications of housekeepers,
to serve as domestics. Some verbal agreement had been entered
into whereby the girls were to accept service as domestics and work out the
cost of transportation and clothing at a stipulated rate per week. The arrangement
seems to have progressed fairly until the girls became acquainted with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' name='Page_372' href='#Page_372'>372</a></span>
other colored people residing in the neighborhood. It was then discovered
that they were working at a wage considerably lower than the usual wage.
The girl in question, who was a minor but seems to have misrepresented her
age when applying for a passport, was receiving $6.00 per week, one dollar
of which was paid in cash and the balance deducted to cover the expense of
clothing and transportation. After becoming dissatisfied with these wages,
the girl left the home of her white employer, who sought to be appointed her
guardian so that he could restrain her. A guardian has not thus far been
appointed, for the reason that the legal status of the girl and the legality of the
contract entered into are doubtful.
</p>

<h4>
III. EMPLOYERS' EXPERIENCE WITH NEGRO LABOR
</h4>

<p>
The entrance of Negroes in large numbers into manufacturing industries
and clerical occupations is one of the striking facts shown by this investigation.
Shortage of labor due to war conditions created many openings for the Negro.
Whether he will remain in these fields and become an increasingly important
factor in them will depend in a large degree upon his efficiency and reliability,
as well as upon absence of racial friction, satisfactory wages, etc. It was
therefore deemed important to learn how the Negro improved his industrial
opportunities.
</p>

<p>
The Commission made some investigation of this subject, seeking the
opinion of as many employers as possible who had had experience with Negro
workers. The inquiry covered two points: (1) a general question in the preliminary
questionnaire, to learn whether Negro labor had proved satisfactory;
and (2) a comparison of the Negro with the white worker in efficiency, reliability,
regularity, and labor turnover. The facts under each head are considered
separately below, following a brief consideration of the difference
between the southern and northern Negro.
</p>

<h5>
1. SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN NEGROES COMPARED
</h5>

<p>
Many employers drew a distinction between the recent southern migrants
and northern Negroes, and commented upon certain shortcomings of the
former, although they expressed themselves as satisfied on the whole with
Negro labor.
</p>

<p>
For instance, the representative of a foundry company with 200 Negroes
out of a total of 950 employees said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It appears to me that the men coming from the South get here and for a limited
length of time seem to have a different view of things. They do things that probably
the Chicago Negro wouldn't do. They don't seem to know exactly how to control
themselves. They are unsettled and to a great degree unsteady. The northern-born
Negro is more active. He is brighter in a way and a little more ambitious.
The southern Negroes are inclined to work today, lay off tomorrow, and be back the
next day on the job again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' name='Page_373' href='#Page_373'>373</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
A representative of a large machinery-manufacturing establishment
employing 1,500 Negroes out of a total of 23,000 employees in Chicago expressed
the same opinion in these words:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Our experience with Negroes has a tendency to show that these people do not
realize that there is such a thing as steady work. They work for possibly a week or
two, then say they are obliged to lay off for some imaginary cause and will probably
return within a week or four weeks. We believe they are improving and will be better
as time goes on and they become more used to the way work and business are done in
the North.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The superintendent of a foundry which increased its Negro employees in
five years from six to 125 out of a total of 466 employees was of the following
opinion:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The Negro up here from the South never heard of working six days a week and
being on time every morning and staying until the job was done. It is entirely foreign
to his idea of things, but with a little persistent effort and showing him that it is necessary
he soon learns the system the same as the others, and I do not believe he is any
worse than the white man after he has been here a year or two.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The superintendent of a company employing more that 2,000 Negroes out
of a total of 10,000 employees in Chicago declared:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The southern Negroes have not yet become thoroughly reconciled to working
six days a week. Down South they are accustomed to taking off Saturdays, and they
are quite frequently absent on Saturday. That is not true of the colored man who
has been with us a long time. He is accustomed to the regularity of six days a week,
but the men from the South have the weakness of being away on Saturdays.

</p>
</div>

<p>
In general it was the employers of large numbers of Negroes who differentiated
between the southern and the northern Negro. Employers of Negroes
in small numbers were more inclined to judge all Negroes by those recently
arrived from the South.
</p>

<h5>
2. NEGRO LABOR SATISFACTORY
</h5>

<p>
One of the questions contained in the preliminary questionnaire was:
"Has your Negro labor proved satisfactory?" Of 137 questionnaires returned
by establishments employing five or more Negro workers, 118 reported that
Negro labor had proved satisfactory and nineteen that it had not proved
satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
The significance of these returns is disclosed by Table XXVI, in
which the establishments are classified by industries, and the number of Negro
employees in establishments reporting Negro labor satisfactory is shown to
be 21,640 as contrasted with 697 Negro employees in the nineteen establishments
reporting Negro labor unsatisfactory.

<h5>
3. NEGRO AND WHITE LABOR COMPARED
</h5>

<p>
At a conference at which Negro and white workers were under discussion
a large foundry representative suggested that such a comparison was unfair
to the Negro because he was still a newcomer in manufacturing industries and
could not be expected to be as efficient, reliable, and regular as the white
worker who had been thus engaged much longer. Other employers felt that
this point should be borne in mind.
</p>

<p>
<i>Efficiency.</i>â€”Comparing the efficiency of the Negro worker and the white
worker, seventy-one employers interviewed (thirty-four manufacturing and
thirty-seven non-manufacturing establishments) considered the Negro equally
efficient, and twenty-two employers (thirteen manufacturing and nine non-manufacturing)
considered the Negro less efficient.<a name='FA_71' id='FA_71' href='#FN_71' class='fnanchor'>[71]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' name='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>375</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The seventy-one establishments which reported Negro labor as equally
efficient as white labor included all of the large employers of Negro labor, with
very few exceptions. Ability shown by Negro workers in widely dissimilar
occupations and industries was commented upon. The following instances
are of interest:
</p>

<p>
Foundries: "Our star molder in the foundry is a Negro who has been
with us twenty years. Our best truck driver is a Negro who has been with
us about eighteen years." "About the best grinder we have in one department
is a colored man." The superintendent of a large foundry employing 125
Negroes said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

I covered thirty foundries, members of the National Association when I was serving
on a certain Committee, and I know that in their departments Negroes have made
very good. Out of the thirty foundries, there are half or more which have colored men
in now which did not have colored men two years ago. One of the instances, a little
foundry I know of, had four men in the grinding department; one colored man and
his partner wanted to take the job of running the grinding room. The partner
wanted to do it all himself, and is now doing what four men were doing formerly.

</p>
</div>

<p>
That the Negro is apt in learning new work is illustrated by an instance
cited by the same superintendent:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

I know of a Pullman porter who has been with the Pullman Company twenty
years who turned out to be as good a helper as we had in the foundry. Take a man
who has made beds for twenty years, put him to carrying melted iron in a ladle,
which is a real man's job, and make good at it, and I think he's going some! We had
one man who did that and did it well. He was a helper that the different foremen
tried to get hold of, wanted to have him with them.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Public service: The probation department of the juvenile court reported
six Negro employees. "The colored employees are intelligent, efficient
persons. With one exception they are probation officers. One employee is
in charge of the probation clerk's office and not only works with white clerks
but directs the work of nine white persons."
</p>

<p>
The office of the recorder of deeds reports seventeen Negro employees in
the folio or record-writing department. "The employees are marked on their
efficiency. Percentages of efficiency run from 94.5 to 98 per cent among the
colored clerks, and several of them averaged 97.9 per cent and 98 per cent for
the past three years."
</p>

<p>
Stock Yards: "Negroes make skilled workmen. They are among the best
of what are known as 'knife-men' we have."
</p>

<p>
Whether Negro labor shows greater efficiency in a working unit composed
entirely of colored workers or in a mixed unit of Negro and white
workers is an unsettled question. Only a few employers expressed an opinion
on this point (not affording a sufficient basis for generalization), but it is interesting
to note that of four foundries, one favored the separate unit and three the
mixed unit, while a large food-products company had found both satisfactory.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_376' name='Page_376' href='#Page_376'>376</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Several employers mentioned the fact that, because of his knowledge of
English, the Negro is frequently more efficient than the foreign-speaking
worker. One wool warehouse company, for example, reported that Poles
were satisfactory under the old method of shipping wool in carloads from a
single shipper, but the new system, with shipments of hundreds of sacks
tagged with the names of as many shippers, required laborers unloading the
cars to separate the shipments into sections. This the Poles were unable to
do, while the Negroes did the work very efficiently.
</p>

<p>
<i>Reliability.</i>â€”Does the Negro require more supervision than the white
worker in order to secure equally good results? An opinion was expressed
on this point by ninety-two employers; sixty-three (thirty manufacturing
and thirty-three non-manufacturing establishments) considered that the Negro
did not require more supervision while twenty-eight (sixteen manufacturing
and thirteen non-manufacturing establishments) considered that he did. The
general superintendents of two of the large packing companies expressed
contrary views on this point during one of the conferences. One said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Negroes do not require as much supervision as some of those racial groups who
do not understand the language. We can talk to a man and tell him what to do,
where to go to do the work and how to do it, we can accomplish a whole lot more than
if we had to send an individual with him constantly from place to place to show him
how to do it. To that extent the Negro has the advantage over the man who cannot
talk the English language.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The superintendent of the other company expressed the opinion that
Negroes require more supervision than white workers:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

For example, when they are working together in groups, especially after pay-day,
they are inclined to wander into isolated spots and shoot craps. We've a good deal
of trouble of that kind. They spend their money when they get it more recklessly
than white people.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The representative of a food-products company with 500 Negro employees
in the working force of 3,000 stated that the company had found no need of
greater supervision of Negro workers than of white.
</p>

<p>
A representative of a taxicab company employing 250 colored workers
stated:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

We have some colored employees we trust absolutely and as far as any white
employees. We have some colored men in the garage, and they take more supervision
not because they are colored but because they lack education and are shiftless, but
this you would find in the same grade of white workers.

</p>
</div>

<p>
A preliminary questionnaire returned by the president of a laundry company
employing eighty-two Negroes out of a total of 110 employees reported:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have a number of exceptionally good and reliable Negro employees. These
men and women need very little supervision. We get some, who have never worked
in industries, who require more supervision and are not very steady. On the whole
we are pleased with our Negro employees.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' name='Page_377' href='#Page_377'>377</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Regularity.</i>â€”Of the employers interviewed, fifty-seven (twenty-three
manufacturing and thirty-four non-manufacturing establishments) expressed
an opinion that "absenteeism" among colored workers was no greater than
among white workers, while thirty-six employers (twenty-four manufacturing
and twelve non-manufacturing establishments) reported that it was greater.
In this connection the habits of the southern Negro, commented upon above,
would naturally exercise great influence. The superintendent of one of the
packing companies employing 2,084 Negroes reported:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Previous to the war and up to the war the Negro was the poorest in attendance
in the plant. Since the war his attendance compares favorably with any other class
of employees in the Yards. It is pretty hard to explain excepting this, as they lived
here longer they acquired better habits, I mean more ambition, and ambition brought
about the necessity for better methods of living, better clothing, and they required
more money and I guess they found out in a short time that work brought its compensations.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The tendency to work and accumulate a little and then take a vacation
is no more pronounced among the colored workers than among the white
workers, according to the representative of a food-products company employing
500 Negroes out of a total of 3,000 employees.
</p>

<p>
<i>Labor turnover and "hope on the job."</i>â€”Of the fifty-two employers expressing
an opinion on the comparative labor turnover of Negro and white workers
twenty-four (eleven manufacturing and thirteen non-manufacturing establishments)
considered the labor turnover about equal, and twenty-eight (eighteen
manufacturing and ten non-manufacturing establishments) considered the
turnover greater among the Negro workers.
</p>

<p>
Closely connected with the question of labor turnover among Negroes is
the question of "hope on the job," as one alert Negro expressed it. The desire
to secure improved conditions of work and higher wages is shared by all workers
irrespective of race. If Negro workers are not allowed to advance to better
positions in a given plant, or if they are discriminated against by having their
efficiency underrated by foremen, the turnover of Negro labor will naturally
be high. The attitude of foremen largely determines whether Negro workers
will succeed or fail. Superintendents of large plants realizing this fact have
taken special care to educate foremen in the treatment of Negro labor.
</p>

<p>
For example, the superintendent of a tannery with 175 Negroes out of a
total of 600 employees notified his foremen that he intended to use Negro
labor, and that any foreman who felt that he could not teach colored workers
would have to yield his place to someone who could. Frequent lectures to
foremen were necessary to make them realize that fairness to Negro labor meant
tolerance of a beginner's awkwardness and shortcomings and refraining from
the use of insulting terms such as "nigger," etc.
</p>

<p>
Another company reported that when it attempted to fill skilled positions
with Negroes the foremen said they would never be able to teach them as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' name='Page_378' href='#Page_378'>378</a></span>
long as they lived. "It couldn't be done." The foremen were told they
had to do it, and they now agree that it can be done and are "quite won over
to the point of employing Negroes." The experience of this plant led the
superintendent to the conclusion that no particular race is especially fitted for
any given kind of work.
</p>

<p>
The superintendent of a foundry employing 2,500 men, of whom 427 are
Negroes, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The foremen told me one time that they never could get a colored man to grind
because he was afraid of the wheel. I thought we'd better try out a few of them.
We found that was not the fact at all. One of the best grinders we now have is a
colored man.

</p>
</div>

<p>
In discussing the attitude of foremen toward colored labor, the superintendent
of another large foundry made this significant statement:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

I think 50 per cent of what trouble we who employ Negro labor have is due to inefficient
foremen, and the failure is in the foreman directly over the man to understand
the Negro. As I see it, the Negro must be handled differently from the Pole whom we
have usually had in the common labor capacity. We cannot handle the Negro
the same as we could the Pole. Our foremen have not been accustomed here in
Chicago in our shops to handling Negroes, and at times I have a real fight to see a
Negro get an absolutely square deal.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The industrial secretary of the Chicago Urban League, referring to a large
firm engaged in the manufacture of machinery, remarked:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

I find the attitude of the company liberal. Negroes are advanced to high-grade
positions, although some foremen need education in order to have them take the
proper attitude toward the employment of Negroes. One foreman set their efficiency
down to 75 per cent; the matter was taken to the efficiency department and his
statement was found to be untrue. This bears out the point that Negroes will not
succeed where foremen do not intend them to succeed.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Despite occasional statements that the Negro is slow or shiftless, the volume
of evidence before the Commission shows that Negroes are satisfactory
employees and compare favorably with other racial groups.
</p>

<h5>
4. NEGRO WOMEN IN INDUSTRY
</h5>

<p>
Before the war created openings in industry for Negro women, they were
even more definitely restricted in their choice of occupations than were Negro
men. Restricted opportunity is evident from the fact that, in 1910, almost
two-thirds of the gainfully occupied Negro women in Chicago were engaged
in two occupational groups, "servants" and "laundresses not in laundries,"
these being included among those in domestic and personal service who numbered
more than three-fourths. The enumeration of Negro women gainfully
employed in Chicago in 1910 classified in the census according to industries
is given in Table XXVII.

To learn the special problems concerning Negro women in industry, one
conference was devoted to the industries recently opened to them. Representatives
of four establishments employing a total of 1,713 Negro women
attended the conference. The investigation of the 101 establishments (employing
five or more Negroes) disclosed the presence of women in a large majority
of cases, but in a number of instances the management was unable to tell the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_380' name='Page_380' href='#Page_380'>380</a></span>
sex of workers from the records kept and gave the investigator the total number
of Negroes employed without classification by sex. Of the 137 establishments
reporting, forty-two had no Negro women employees; forty-five kept no
separate sex records; fifty reported separately the number of Negro women
workers.
</p>

<p>
Comparing the industries in which Negro women were employed in 1910
with the figures quoted for 1920, a striking increase is seen in the total engaged
in manufacturing, 998 being the total Negro women reported for all manufacturing
establishments in Chicago in 1910, as compared with 1,295 Negro
women reported by twenty-seven establishments in 1920.

Labor shortage was given as the reason for employing Negro women and
girls by all of the firms employing them in large numbers. The outlook for
Negro women in industry when there is a labor surplus is uncertain. Employers
employing 1,713 Negro women represented at a conference, May 18,
1920, agreed that there were no indications of a reduction of employment.
This question is considered at length hereafter in "Future of the Negro in
Chicago Industries."
</p>

<p class="center">
EXPERIMENTS WITH NEGRO WOMEN WORKERS
</p>

<p>
Employers' opinions regarding the character of Negro labor without reference
to sex were considered above. Particular comments concerning male
workers were quoted there, comments upon women workers are now given.
Four employers of Negro women in large numbers within the past two years
gave the Commission the benefit of their experience. They were two mail-order
concerns, a manufacturer of automobile spring cushions, and a wholesale
millinery shop.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="s08">This concern when it increased its number of Negro women, combined its four shops and moved into this modern daylight factory building.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The mail-order house which established a large office for Negro entry
clerks in September, 1918, was the first to try the experiment. It had no
precedent to guide it and "did not know how the colored girl would act in
business." The unit was opened with ninety girls, and increased in the fall
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_381' name='Page_381' href='#Page_381'>381</a></span>
of 1919 to 650 girls, who were given the promise of advancement and Negro
supervision. In the early summer of 1920, when the investigator visited this
office, there were 311 girls at work, as follows:

<p>
They were above the average in education, 75 per cent being high-school
graduates and 12 per cent having had two or more years in college.
</p>

<p>
The employment manager said that misunderstandings had arisen occasionally,
due to the colored girl being oversensitive and suspicious. "The
colored girl seems to suspect that her employer is going to put something over
on her. She is suspicious of any whites that come in her vicinity and is ready
to believe that any white person is prejudiced against her on account of race."
</p>

<p>
The Negro welfare worker for this unit suggested that what might seem
supersensitiveness was often overzealousness on the part of girls who have not
had experience enough to judge their limitations or qualifications. Being
eager to succeed, they are very much disappointed when advancement does
not reward their efforts: "I think the best type of colored girl we have in
business is very ambitious. This is her first opportunity, and she feels that
she is really a pioneer making history for her race. She is possibly a little
overzealous, but can be made to get the right attitude and accept it all very
gracefully."
</p>

<p>
Another characteristic of Negro girls, in the opinion of the employment
manager, was an "excitable nature" which made it possible for a good leader
to influence them readily:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
They complain of a change of supervisors, for instance. You attempt to shift
supervisors from one point of the office to another and you immediately receive a
petition signed by all the girls, saying, "We love So-and-So, and please don't change
her." This is not to be criticized too harshly, but it does represent something that
does go on. It shows inexperience. The white girl would expect that those things
would take place. The colored girl, not having been in the office very long, would
feel that the fact that the supervisor was changed was something derogatory to the
supervisor.
</p>

<p>
The whites didn't want to act as instructors, and the colored girls didn't want to
receive instructions from the whites. By being very careful in the girls that were
selected, and showing the white girls where they were wrong, and then attempting
to show the colored people that these girls were not to exercise supervision, but were
merely to be instructors, both sides came to an understanding on it, and we had
pretty good results. The white girls that we had over there became very used to it
and usually hated to leave, but we have always insisted that they leave as soon as the
girls learned the work.

</p>
</div>

<p>
During the conference on Negro women in industry the representative of
this mail-order establishment was asked why the Negro workers were put into
a separate unit instead of being intermingled with white girls. He answered:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The first reason is that we haven't any room. The second is, I imagine, because
the officials who started the office and who have carried it on since felt that it wouldn't
be policy. We haven't discussed the question because we've never had occasion to
consider such a move seriously. Our main office is not large enough to accommodate
any more employees than we have white employees in the house. We keep that
office constantly recruited up to its present strength, and there has never been any
necessity or any reason to seriously consider bringing colored girls in with the
white girls....
</p>

<p>
Another thing to consider there would be the type of girl that we employ. They
are all young girls, mostly under twenty-five years, and they don't think for themselves;
they are influenced very easily by what other girls say. You take one girl in
an office of that size who was very anti-colored, and it wouldn't be very long until
her sentiment would spread and pretty soon you'd have a strong sentiment against the
colored girls.
</p>

<p>
If a colored girl should want to obtain employment in that part of our concern
where we now employ all white girls, even if she were very competent she would
undoubtedly have some trouble in securing employment in that department.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The result of the experiment with the colored unit, he said, was highly
satisfactory: "We have been very favorably impressed.... The girls
have made very rapid progress, in fact they surprised all of us. Their
progress along lines of leadership, as supervisors, etc., has been remarkable."
</p>

<p>
About six weeks after this conference the colored unit was closed. The
reasons given were lack of business, trouble with the lessor of the office, and
failure to find another convenient location. A letter of recommendation was
given to each employee showing that her service had been satisfactory, and a
letter was also sent to the Urban League, through which the women had been
employed, explaining why it had been necessary to close the office and emphasizing
the fact that this action should not be considered in any sense a reflection
upon the Negro workers employed.
</p>

<p>
The other mail-order house opened a unit for Negro women in the fall of
1918, with 650 women who worked until the end of the "fall rush" in January,
1919. In the following fall the unit was again opened, with 1,050 Negro women;
and the office was still in operation in 1920. This office was just outside the
"Loop" district. The sudden influx of Negro girls there caused complaints
by the local restaurants, fearing the loss of old patrons in handling this new
business. The company then installed an "at cost" cafeteria service. The
work of these girls was clerical, billing, labeling, addressing, etc. Considering
their inexperience, their service has been highly satisfactory. The employment
manager said: "It's not a defect in their minds, it's a defect in the country.
They haven't had the opportunity to gain the education and experience
needed for responsibility; the Negro girl is equal to the Italian or Bohemian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' name='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
in working ability and superior for executive work, such as instructing or
supervising." Among 143 girls interviewed in the entry offices of these two
mail-order houses only three expressed dissatisfaction with the conditions of
work. The girls seemed to take pride in the fact that they had succeeded
in "making good" in a new and attractive field of work.
</p>

<p>
The experiment of the establishment manufacturing automobile spring
cushions had a very modest beginning. A factory was rented in the Negro
residential area on the South Side, and twenty machines were installed to test
out Negro women as sewing-machine operators. Gradually the number
increased to 120 in this plant, and a second plant was opened in the same
vicinity with about the same number of operators. During the year 1919-20
there were 250 Negro women employed as machine operators in these two
plants. The superintendent considered that they required less supervision
than the white workers in the company's other shops and rated them equal to
white workers in efficiency. "We could take our best white girl and our best
colored girl, and they earn about the same amount of money on piecework
rates, in the same number of hours."
</p>

<p>
The superintendent of the wholesale millinery establishment represented
in conference considered that the employment of Negro women in that industry
had outgrown the experimental stage. Although a long period of training is
necessary in order to become a skilled milliner (four years for hand sewers,
eight years for machine operators), Negro women were keen to learn the trade
and willing to accept the low wages paid to beginners. Of the forty-seven
Negro women employed on the day of the investigator's visit, thirty-three
received less than $12.00 a week and forty-two received less than $15.00 a
week. These women were all employed as hand sewers, and in the opinion of
the superintendent they had done "just as well as the white. They learn as
quickly and are as persevering, and in every respect equal to the whites as far
as their work is concerned. We are absolutely satisfied with their work."
</p>

<p>
Other industries in which Negro women are engaged in considerable
numbers include laundering, the manufacture of clothing, lamp shades, gas
mantles, paper boxes, barrels, and cheese making. An investigator from the
Commission visited establishments employing Negro women in each of these
industries.
</p>

<p>
<i>Laundry operatives.</i>â€”The fact that 543 Negro women laundry operatives
were reported by sixteen laundries, as contrasted with 184 in all Chicago
laundries in 1910, gives evidence of an increase in the number of Negro women
in this field proportionately much greater than the increase in Negro population
in Chicago in the same decade. The opportunity to work in a laundry was
practically denied to Negro women until labor shortage forced laundry owners
to tap this reserve labor supply. Negro women were eager to desert work as
domestic servants and "family washer-women," with the social stigma and
restricted human contact involved, to enter laundries where more independence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_384' name='Page_384' href='#Page_384'>384</a></span>
was possible, hours were better standardized, and association with fellow-workers
enlivened the work day. The employment department of the Urban
League experienced great difficulty in supplying the demand for domestic
servants and laundresses in the home, but had no difficulty in filling openings
in laundries.
</p>

<p>
The work of Negro women in this field has proved satisfactory except in a
few establishments. Of the twenty laundries which reported Negro labor
satisfactory or unsatisfactory (included in Table XXVI), four failed to report
separate figures covering male and female employees. Of the remaining
sixteen establishments, twelve, with a total of 409 Negro women, reported
Negro labor satisfactory, and four with a total of 134 Negro women, reported
Negro labor unsatisfactory. The complaint in two instances was unwillingness
to work overtime and on Sundays. In both these instances the employees
interviewed complained that hours were long (nine-hour day) and the treatment
by the management harsh and inconsiderate.
</p>

<p>
Laundries which did not make a practice of requiring overtime and Sunday
work found Negro women workers cheerful, loyal, and industrious. The
employees interviewed in these establishments expressed satisfaction with
working conditions and with hours.
</p>

<p>
One efficiently managed laundry, employing seventy-six Negro women and
six Negro men, out of a total of 110 employees, reported: "We have a number
of exceptionally good and loyal Negro employees. These men and women
need very little supervision. We got some who have never worked in industries.
They require more supervision and are not very steady. On the whole,
we are well pleased with our Negro employees."
</p>

<p>
<i>Sewing-machine operators and sewers.</i>â€”Denial of opportunity to enter the
sewing trades is evidenced by the small number of Negro women listed in the
1910 census as sewers and sewing-machine operators in factories, the number
being twenty-five. That this exclusion was not because of any natural inaptitude
for sewing is indicated by the fact that the 1910 census listed 867 Negro
women as seamstresses not in factories. Negro women have entered millinery
work and proved apt hand workers; they have also proved efficient sewing-machine
operators in the manufacture of automobile cushions. The lampshade
manufacturers employed Negro women as hand sewers and found them
to be efficient workers. The clothing establishments which reported Negro
women workers found them satisfactory machine and hand workers, with the
exception of one apron factory which complained that they are shiftless,
often unreasonable, and do not stick to the job. An investigation of this
establishment by the Urban League disclosed the following facts: The shop
was located in a shabby-looking, unclean store, inadequately heated by a coal
stove. The work day was nine and one-half hours, and piece rates on several
operations were so low that it was impossible to earn a decent wage. In this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_385' name='Page_385' href='#Page_385'>385</a></span>
case the large labor turnover was evidently a healthy protest against poor
working conditions.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-527" id="i-527"></a>
<img src="images/i-527.jpg" width="600" height="363" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NEGRO WOMEN AND GIRLS IN A LARGE HAT-MAKING CONCERN
<br />
<span class="s08">This shop has been partitioned for the accommodation of Negro women workers. The workshop is unattractive and the lighting extremely poor for the character
of work required.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Other industries.</i>â€”Three paper-box-making plants employing Negro women
were investigated. They reported that Negro women had proved unsatisfactory,
either slow or lazy. The experience of a cheese factory is worth noting
in this connection. Because Negro women appeared to be slow at their work
it was decided to measure their tasks. It was then found that many were
doing as well as and some better than the white girls in whose places they were
working.
</p>

<p>
Whether such tests had ever been made in the box-making plants does not
appear. The employees interviewed in one box factory complained of low
wages and no chance for advancement. Negro women in this plant were
averaging only $2.40 a day. A cooperage company reported fifteen women
stave carriers and fifteen machine operators. Negro labor in this plant was
reported satisfactory. Negro women in the garage of a taxicab company,
cleaning automobiles, have shown themselves not afraid of hard work; 100
Negro women were reported working in this capacity. Negro women as
Pullman-car cleaners have also proved satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
Before the war Negro women were popularly thought of as a class of
servants unfitted by nature for work calling for higher qualifications. It is
difficult to say how long this popular misconception might have survived had
it not been for the labor shortage which forced employers to experiment with
Negro women workers and to learn with surprise that they were as teachable
as white women and became as efficient workers after receiving the necessary
training.
</p>

<h4>
IV. INDUSTRY AS THE NEGRO SEES IT
</h4>

<h5>
1. ATTITUDE TOWARD INDUSTRIAL OPPORTUNITIES
</h5>

<p>
In order to learn the attitude of the Negro toward his work, and his special
problems, including the treatment accorded him by foremen and by fellow-workers,
865 Negro employees were interviewed by a Negro investigator at their
work or at home. Less than 1 per cent of those interviewed complained of
disagreeable treatment by white workers. Approximately one-half had no
complaints to make about conditions of work. On the contrary, they expressed
themselves as being glad of the opportunity to work and earn good wages.
</p>

<p>
The attitude of a large number of the workers interviewed is illustrated by
the following:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Câ€”â€” Wâ€”â€” was referred to in one of the industrial conferences before the Commission.
The superintendent of the foundry said he was the "star molder" in the plant.
When interviewed Câ€”â€” Wâ€”â€” said he had come to Chicago in 1910 from Kentucky
because he was tired of being a flunkey. He had been in the high school for two years,
but could only get work as janitor in a public building in his home town. After coming
here he worked in a foundry as a molder's helper until he learned the trade. "I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_386' name='Page_386' href='#Page_386'>386</a></span>
getting 38 cents an hour then, but I got on piecework and my wages have steadily
gone up. I'm an expert now and make as much as any man in the place. I can quit
any time I want to, but the longer I work the more money it is for me, so I usually
work eight or nine hours a day. I am planning to educate my girl with the best of
them, buy a home before I'm too old, and make life comfortable for my family.
There is more chance here to learn a trade than in the South. I live better, can save
more, and I feel more like a man."
</p>

<p>
Râ€”â€” Nâ€”â€”, who is working as a helper in the same foundry, says he has just gone
from one job to another. In the South he worked on a section gang on the railroad
most of the time. "Didn't have to know much to get a job on the section gangâ€”just
able to lift." Friends here wrote him of the chances to make money, so he came
because he was just drifting anyway. When he got here he thought Chicago was "full
of life." Every night for a month he went to cabarets. He likes his work and his
wages. "My wife can have her clothes fitted here; she can try on a hat and if she
don't want it she don't have to buy it. I can go anywhere I please on the cars after
I pay my fare, and I can do any sort of work I know how to do."
</p>

<p>
When Mâ€”â€” Gâ€”â€” came to Chicago in 1900 he thought it "the biggest place in the
world and the world didn't reach much further. Life is easier here because you can
make more money. Working conditions are better than in the South, but they could
be better still." He worked as a butler in the South, but when he came to Chicago
he got out of personal service and became a laborer in the Stock Yards. Later he
went to Gary, Indiana, to the steel works, where he is earning about $40.00 a week.
His wife is doing clerical work in a mail-order house and is going to night school three
nights a week to learn typing.
</p>

<p>
Hâ€”â€” Bâ€”â€” with his family left Mississippi in 1916 and came to Chicago, where he
found work as a coal heaver at $3.20 a day. His wife sorted paper in a junk house
at $10.00 a week, and his daughter entered a canning department at the Stock Yards
at $18.00 a week. When Mr. Bâ€”â€” was interviewed in June, 1920, he was working in
the Stock Yards and earning $27.00 a week for an eight-hour day. He said he didn't
have to work nearly as hard here as in the South and was earning enough money so
his wife could stay at home. "In the South you had to work whether you wanted
to or not unless you were very sick. White people did not work there as they do here.
They made the Negro do the work. Men and women had to work in the fields. A
woman was not permitted to remain at home if she felt like it. If she was found at
home some of the white people would come to ask why she was not in the field and
tell her she had better get to the field or else abide by the consequences. After the
summer crops were all in, any of the white people could send for any Negro woman to
come and do the family washing at 75 cents to $1.00 a day. If she sent word she could
not come she had to send an excuse why she could not come. They were never allowed
to stay at home as long as they were able to go. Had to take whatever they paid you
for your work."
</p>

<p>
Mâ€”â€” Hâ€”â€” "likes the air of doing things here." He is able to earn enough to keep
the family without having his wife go out to work. There are four "youngsters,"
the oldest being eight years old. Mr. Hâ€”â€” came to Chicago in 1918 from Tennessee.
He complained that there was not much work for a man in his home town. He did
whatever odd jobs turned up. People there were talking about the chances in
Chicago, so he came here and went to work as a monument setter on the West Side.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_387' name='Page_387' href='#Page_387'>387</a></span>
Later he found a better-paying job in a mattress factory and was able to send for his
family. He is now working in a foundry and makes $35.00 a week but finds it hard
to live on this. If he can go to night school he feels he will be able to earn more money.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lâ€”â€” works as an entry clerk in a mail-order house and likes everything connected
with the place. She used to be a maid in a private family but says she wouldn't
work in service again "for any money. I can save more when I'm in service, for of
course you get room and board, but the other things you have to takeâ€”no place to
entertain your friends but the kitchen, and going in and out the back doors. I hated
all that. Then, no matter how early you got through work you could only go out
one night a weekâ€”they almost make you a slave. You can do other work in Chicago
and you don't have to work in such places."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lâ€”â€” had taught school in Atlanta, Georgia. After her husband died she
had tried to get back in the school but could not. Friends here advised her to move
to Chicago, so she sold her property in 1915 and came here. She got work in the
Stock Yards but gave music lessons on the side to help keep up expenses. "I hated
the surroundings at the Yards and the class of people who worked there, so when I
had a chance to work in a mail-order house I changed. The first work here was
filing. I learned it very quickly and tried so hard to make good that they made me a
supervisor." She likes the freedom of the North and the opportunities to advance in
work. Her ambition is to get into the public schools as a teacher.
</p>

<p>
Miss Tâ€”â€” Sâ€”â€”, twenty-two years old, started to work when she was fourteen,
helping her mother cook for a large family in Lexington, Georgia. Her mother died
when she was about seventeen, and she continued to work in the same family about
three years. Then some relatives persuaded her to come north with them in 1919.
She worked as a waitress in Chicago until her cousin got her a job in a box factory.
"I'll never work in nobody's kitchen but my own any more. No, indeed! That's
the one thing that makes me stick to this job. You do have some time to call your
own, but when you're working in anybody's kitchen, well, you're out of luck. You
almost have to eat on the run; you never get any time off, and you have to work
half the night, usually. I make more money here than I did down South, but I
can't save anything out of itâ€”there are so many places to go here, but down South
you work, work, work, and you have to save your money because you haven't any
place to spend it."

</p>
</div>

<p>
Many of those interviewed were grateful for the opportunity to work overtime
at overtime rates. A number complained that they were able to spend
but little time with their families, or in recreation, because they were compelled
to live in districts far from the plants in which they worked, so that two, and
often three, hours a day were wasted on the cars. The Negroes who had come
to Chicago within the past two or three years as a rule were satisfied with
conditions of work, including hours, wages, and treatment.
</p>

<h5>
2. COMPLAINTS ABOUT CONDITIONS OF WORK
</h5>

<p>
Among the Negroes who had lived in Chicago for a longer period the most
insistent complaint was lack of opportunity for advancement or promotion.
This was occasionally coupled with the complaint that foremen discriminated
in favor of the white workers. In certain industries no complaint of treatment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' name='Page_388' href='#Page_388'>388</a></span>
by foremen was made, while approximately 10 per cent of those interviewed
in three industries (mentioned below) complained of discrimination in favor
of white workers, in the distribution of work, in recognition of efficiency, or in
permitting the earning of overtime rates. The industries registering the
greatest percentage of complaints were: (1) foundry and iron and steel mills,
(2) Stock Yards, and (3) railroad dining-car and Pullman service. The
common complaints in each of these fields are considered briefly below.
</p>

<p>
<i>Foundries and iron and steel manufacturing.</i>â€”The ninety-three Negro
employees interviewed in fourteen establishments in this field were of different
grades of skill: fifty-nine unskilled, twelve semi-skilled, nineteen skilled, and
three apprentices to skilled trades. The length of time in the plant varied
from a week to twenty years (forty-one employees less than one year, and
eighty less than five years). To the inquiry, "Is anything wrong with your
conditions of work?" fifty answered, "No"; sixteen complained that hours
were too long (in these cases the men were working a twelve-hour day and a
seven-day week); ten complained of low wages; six that foremen or straw
bosses were not fair in the distribution of work or of "heats"; four complained
that straight-time pay only was allowed for overtime, three that working gangs
were reduced without decreasing the work demanded or increasing the pay of
the men who remained; one thought that Negroes were paid lower wages than
white workers; one said the work in his plant was much dirtier than it need
be; and two were dissatisfied because shower or locker accommodations were
insufficient.
</p>

<p>
A foundry company employing twenty Negroes out of a total of eighty
employees was one of the establishments reporting Negro labor unsatisfactory.
Negroes interviewed there complained of harsh and unfair treatment by
bosses and said that Negroes usually did not stay longer than thirty days. The
employment manager of a large foundry employing 427 Negroes out of a total
of 2,488 employees told the investigator that the foremen in the plant would
refuse to use Negroes if white labor could be obtained, and if such a time should
come the foremen would have their way, because it took years to make a foreman,
but a laborer could be picked up any day. The investigator was not
permitted to interview any of the employees at this plant, but he visited some
of them at their homes. They complained of harsh treatment by foremen,
reduction in piece rates without notice, and discrimination in favor of white
workers. The labor turnover reported by this plant was 70 per cent for Negro
as compared with 14 per cent for white workers. This contrast is readily
accounted for when the attitude of foremen toward Negroes is known.
</p>

<p>
Negroes interviewed at one of the plants of another foundry company
employing seventy-five Negroes out of a total of 300 employees complained
that the foreman in one department established conditions discouraging to
Negro workers. He had an even number of Negro and white workers employed
as partners on a certain process of piecework rates, each doing one-half of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_389' name='Page_389' href='#Page_389'>389</a></span>
joint task. When a man was absent, partners would be shifted about so that
a Negro worker would be left without a partner instead of a white man. This
handicapped the single worker by slowing down the process so he could not
earn a full day's pay. Complaint was also made that the same foreman allowed
white workers to accumulate a supply of material for their work, although
he ordered Negro workers to stop this practice, thus forcing them to lose time
in making frequent trips for material.
</p>

<p>
In a large iron and steel plant a few of the workers interviewed complained
of unfair and abusive treatment by foremen. Numerous complaints had
likewise come to the attention of the industrial secretary of the Urban League,
who took the matter up with the chief of the industrial-relations department
of the company. An investigation was ordered, and it was found that a
certain foreman had made a threat to drive all the "niggers" from the department.
This foreman, who had been employed by the company for more than
sixteen years, was discharged as a result of the investigation. The company
states that considerable pressure has been brought to bear for the foreman's
reinstatement, but that it will not reinstate him because it wants his case to
be a warning to others in the plant who may be prejudiced against Negro
workers. The discharged foreman has been told that he may seek employment
with the company in some other capacity, with the loss of his seniority rights.
</p>

<p>
In contrast with conditions in the preceding cases, the investigator found
no complaints of mistreatment by foremen or other causes for dissatisfaction
among Negro workers at another foundry which employs 125 Negroes out of
a total force of 466 employees. Negro labor in this foundry was reported
"satisfactory" and as efficient as white labor. The attitude of foremen
evidently contributed to the contentment and success of Negroes in this plant.
</p>

<p>
<i>Stock Yards.</i>â€”Interviews with seventy-four Negroes employed in the Stock
Yards disclosed much dissatisfaction with treatment by foremen. Specific
instances of discrimination were cited in great detail, leaving no doubt in the
mind of the investigator that these workers felt that they did not have an equal
chance with white workers in many departments in the Yards. Some of those
interviewed were well pleased with the treatment of present foremen, but had
worked in other departments in the same plants where they said foremen had
been unfair and insulting to Negroes. The Negroes interviewed, with one
exception, considered their treatment by white fellow-workers good or "O.K."
The following are typical of the complaints made by the men interviewed in
three of the large establishments in the Yards:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Gâ€”â€” Râ€”â€” had worked in one plant in the Yards for four years. He said that he
was not given a chance to make overtime, while Poles who had not been with the company
as long as he had were given this privilege.
</p>

<p>
Another worker had been dismissed by a foreman when a white worker in the
boiler room had shut off the supply of water for washing hogs. No blame was
attached to the real offender, but the Negro worker was discharged. He wrote a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' name='Page_390' href='#Page_390'>390</a></span>
letter to the general superintendent, who investigated and ordered his reinstatement.
The foreman then tried to reinstate him as a new hand, which would deprive him of
his seniority rights.
</p>

<p>
Another worker interviewed said that one assistant foreman had openly made
the statement that he would not work with "niggers."
</p>

<p>
The foreman over pipe fitters was accused of placing new Negroes on the hardest
work, with no one to give assistance. He permitted white men to work as helpers
for two or three months, and then to quit for a month or two and return as pipe
fitters, advancing them over Negroes who had more training for the work.
</p>

<p>
The foreman in the sheep-killing department of one of the plants was said by one
worker to make advancement difficult, if not impossible, for Negroes. Another
worker complained that this foreman had recently taken one man off the jaw-trimming
machine but ran the chain just as fast, with the evident intention of overtaxing the
remaining Negroes and reporting that they were not equal to the job.
</p>

<p>
The foreman in the hog-killing department was charged with showing preference
to the Poles in shoulder sawing. If a Negro made complaint to the superintendent
and was sent back with instructions to the foreman, the latter would try to "burn"
the Negro out with work.

</p>
</div>

<p>
It would seem from the discussion of the representatives of the packing
companies before the Commission that the Negro in reality has little opportunity
for promotion in the Yards. There are no Negro foremen over mixed
gangs. The highest position a Negro is able to reach is that of subforeman
over a group of Negro workmen. The general superintendent of one of the
packing companies admitted that he had never tried out a Negro as foreman
over a mixed gang because he wouldn't want to work under a Negro himself.
Such an attitude on the part of a general superintendent closes the door to
experimentation and limits the opportunities of even the most capable Negroes.
It was this same official who said, as previously noted, that Negro labor required
more supervision than white labor, and that the turnover of Negro labor was
greater. Lack of "hope on the job" would seem an adequate explanation of
both conditions.
</p>

<p>
<i>Railroad dining-car and Pullman service.</i>â€”Negroes are used as dining-car
waiters on all roads running out of Chicago which carry such accommodations.
Certain of the roads also use Negro cooks and kitchen help. The dining-cars
on all roads are in charge of white stewards. The source of greatest complaint
among the 204 Negro waiters interviewed was the arbitrary use of authority
by the stewards and the fact that color bars Negro waiters from becoming
stewards. They say that when stewards are needed, intelligent and experienced
Negroes are passed over and white men, often entirely ignorant of the
work, are taught their duties by these Negroes and are then placed in authority
over them. One road carrying seven dining-cars uses white stewards on two
cars and the remaining five cars are in charge of Negroes called "waiters in
charge." Negroes complained that these men get little more than the wages
of a waiter, and in many cases do all that is required of steward and waiter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' name='Page_391' href='#Page_391'>391</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The outstanding complaint concerned the drawing of the color line in
promotion. In view of the fact that many college graduates are serving as
waiters, it would seem absurd to say that Negro waiters are incapable of
performing a steward's duties, which consist of receiving and checking supplies
for the car, seating dining patrons and issuing checks to them, having general
supervision of the other employees on the dining-car, and making daily reports
to the car superintendent of business transacted. Race prejudice on the part
of administrative officials of railroads seems to be the only explanation for
barring Negroes from becoming stewards, in view of the fact that Negro waiters
have been used in dining-cars for over forty years and have been accepted by
the white traveling public as a matter of course, though some contend that
some patrons who accept Negroes as waiters would object to seeing them in
positions of stewards, particularly if that brought white employees under them.
</p>

<p>
Negroes are employed in large numbers in Pullman cars as porters, cleaners,
cooks, and mechanics. The main complaint made by the sixty porters interviewed
was poor wages and necessity of dependency on tips to make a decent
living. The wages of porters, as stated by a representative of the Pullman Company
before the Commission, are:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The minimum rate for a porter on a standard sleeping or parlor car is $60.00 per
month; when running in charge of one car the rate is $70.00 per month; when running
in charge of a private car the rate is $75.00 per month; but when operating in charge
of two or more cars the rate is $155.00 per month.

</p>
</div>

<p>
In 1914 the minimum was either $27.50 or $30.00 per month. Asked
whether the Government Railroad Administration had anything to do with
the increase granted by the Pullman Company, he indicated that the Pullman
Company was under the direction of the Railroad Administration.
</p>

<p>
Another complaint by Pullman porters was that no promotion was possible
for them, since only white men are used as Pullman-car conductors. The
explanation of the company, given by one of its representatives at a conference
with the Commission, was: "It is merely carrying out an ancient and honorable
customâ€”we started out with white conductors and colored porters and have
always continued that way."
</p>

<p>
Interviews with Negro workers revealed individual differences in attitude
and temperament, but the more ambitious and thoughtful Negroes expressed
the conviction that they were barred by color from positions for which they
were better qualified than the white men who held them. Their complaints
were largely variations of the same themeâ€”race discrimination.
</p>

<h4>
V. INDUSTRIES EXCLUDING THE NEGRO
</h4>

<p>
Several important industries in Chicago have not yet employed Negroes.
The traction companies (both elevated and surface) do not employ them as
conductors, motormen, guards, or ticket agents. The large State Street
department stores have no Negro clerks, and taxicab companies do not employ
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_392' name='Page_392' href='#Page_392'>392</a></span>
colored drivers. In these industries, which depend directly upon the public
for patronage, it is to be expected that the employing of Negro help will be
determined by the employer's views of the wishes of his patrons. If there is
any fear that they are unfavorable, any individual employer in a competitive
industry will hesitate to try the experiment alone. The employment managers
of five State Street department stores made the following statements:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

1. Our customers would object to colored salespeople, I am sure.
</p>

<p>
2. We have never employed any Negroes in our Chicago establishments. I don't
care to go into the matter. It will not do you any good and will not do us any good.
</p>

<p>
3. Customers and white employees would object if they were used as clerks.
</p>

<p>
4. No Negroes are ever employed because we have sufficient white applicants.
</p>

<p>
5. If we ever tried using Negroes as clerks the white workers would make trouble,
I am sure of that. Our customers would object. A good many are from the South
and would make trouble even if Chicago people did not.

</p>
</div>

<p>
One large taxicab company, employing 250 Negroes for repair work and
upkeep of automobiles, does not employ Negroes as drivers. A representative
of this company stated that the company had gone as far as many employers,
and often farther, in the employment of Negro labor; that it had done this in
a progressive way, one step after another, but had "not yet got as far as employing
Negro chauffeurs," although this might come in time. When asked
whether he thought such action would affect the company's business unfavorably
he said, "I do not know. It is a matter that I have never thought about."
</p>

<p>
The Chicago Telephone Company does not employ Negro telephone operators.
Its only Negro employees are porters, window washers, and maids.
A representative stated that it has always had sufficient white applicants for
positions as telephone operators and has not considered taking on Negro girls,
although the suggestion has often been made that Negro operators be used at
the Douglas Exchange (located in the Negro area of the South Side). This
official thought there was very little possibility that they would employ Negro
operators in the future. He feared objection from white employees.
</p>

<p>
In connection with the foregoing it may be borne in mind that the company
has answered complaints of poor telephone service within the past few years
with the statement that it is difficult to secure capable girls, and that the
Telephone Company is continually advertising for girls as operators.
</p>

<p>
<i>Social waste involved.</i>â€”The industrial secretary of the Urban League has
called attention to the large number of educated Negro girls who are unable
to secure industrial openings where education is required. It is impossible to
estimate how great a social waste is involved in relegating trained and educated
Negroes to inferior positions, and there is evidence that such waste is considerable.
Negroes with college training are found working as waiters; young
women college graduates are frequently forced to serve as ladies' maids,
theater ushers, or in some other capacity where they are unable to use their
educational training. The fact that it was not difficult to find over 1,500
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' name='Page_393' href='#Page_393'>393</a></span>
Negro women of more than average education for clerical positions in two
Chicago mail-order houses when the opportunity offered is some indication of
the extent of the social waste when Negroes are not used in other positions
which require training.
</p>

<h4>
VI. RELATIONS OF WHITE AND COLORED WORKERS
</h4>

<p>
The entrance of Negroes into new industries and occupations means that
the workers already in these fields will meet increased competition. The self-interest
of white workers in a given shop may therefore cause them to resent
the presence of Negro workers. On the other hand, through contact and
association with Negroes during working hours, white workers may come to
look upon Negroes, not as members of a strange group with colored skin, but
as individuals with the same feelings, hopes, and disappointments as other
people. Whether the hostile attitude prompted by self-interest or the friendly
attitude born of understanding, acquaintance, and daily association will prevail
in any given shop depends on many factors, over some of which the workers
involved have no control. Some of these are:
</p>

<p>
1. The attitude of the management when Negro labor is first introduced.
</p>

<p>
2. Circumstances under which Negroes are hired, whether because of
recognized labor shortage, or as strike breakers, or to reduce labor costs.
</p>

<p>
3. The attitude and characteristics of the particular Negroes employed.
</p>

<p>
4. The attitude of the white workers toward Negroes as a result of previous
contacts with Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The spirit displayed in the shop is likely to spread beyond it and affect
relations between the races on the streets and in cars and other public places.
It is therefore important to know what the relations between white and Negro
workers are, both because of their importance to the Negro in industry and
their bearing on the broader social aspect of race problems.
</p>

<h5>
1. RACE FRICTION AMONG WORKERS
</h5>

<p>
Information concerning race relations in industry was received from
employers through questionnaires returned by 137 establishments employing
a total of 22,337 Negroes, through interviews at places of business with representatives
of 101 employers, through industrial conferences held by the Commission,
and through interviews with 865 Negro workers. Since the best
judges of the existence of race friction would be the Negro workers themselves,
who would bear the brunt of any ill-treatment resulting from such friction,
it was considered that any extended canvass of opinion among white workers
beyond the inquiries made in connection with the trade-union investigation
was unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
Race friction between white and Negro workers sufficient to interfere with
output would militate against the use of Negro labor. The fact that Negro
labor has proved satisfactory in the great majority of cases where it has been
used is therefore indirect evidence that race friction is not pronounced in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>394</a></span>
Chicago industries. Direct evidence from employers on this subject was also
secured in answer to a specific question on the point. Out of 137 establishments
employing Negroes, which returned questionnaires, only two reported
that race friction was a disturbing factor in their plants. The facts in these
two cases were as follows:
</p>

<p>
In a steel-manufacturing plant there was a total of 1,300 employees, of
whom seventeen were Negroes, eleven men and six women. During the steel
strike of 1919 Negroes were employed in this plant in large numbers. Feeling
was antagonistic on the part of the whites, "particularly Austrians and Slavonians."
The total number of Negroes employed during the strike and the
turnover were reported as "an average force of 175."
</p>

<p>
Friction in the foregoing case was probably due to the heritage of bitterness
over the use of Negroes as strike breakers and to irritation caused by the
low grade of workers employed more than to difference in color. They were
described by the manager as "irresponsible and shiftless."
</p>

<p>
In the other case fear of Negroes' competition rather than race prejudice
was apparently the cause of friction. The manager of a wholesale millinery
house employing forty-three girls in one department, out of a total of 700
employees, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

We decided to take on colored help in June, 1919. Our white people resented
very much the fact of employing colored people in our business, and I believe the blame,
if there is any, lies as much with the whites as with the blacks in the difficulties we
have had. I find a great resentment among all our white people. I couldn't overcome
the prejudice enough to bring the people in the same building, and had to engage
outside quarters for the blacks. We had a meeting of our colored operators after
employing the hand workers. We thought it would be nice if we would start a school
for machine operators. It was, of course, rumored that we were going to do this, and
I received a delegation from our sewing hall who said they resented the idea. They
wouldn't listen to it at all, and I had to abandon the project. Their argument was:
"If you let them in it won't be long until we are out entirely." The attitude against
the colored is only the same as it was against the Slavs or the foreign races when they
first intruded in the field. There was no prejudice, particularly against the color.
In millinery establishments in New York City colored girls and white girls work
together and do not seem to have any trouble, but, we can't do it here.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The resentment felt by the white girls in this shop may be accounted for
in part by a fact to which the manager apparently attached no importance.
In speaking of the loyalty and good spirit of the Negro girls, he said casually:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

In a few instances, where we have had difficulty in getting work done by the
whites, we have been able to use the colored workroom as a level. We have sent it
over to them and gotten it out. The white girls have refused either through stubbornness
or some condition to get the work out.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Friction was also reported between women employees in a plant where
relations between the men of both races were reported harmonious. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' name='Page_395' href='#Page_395'>395</a></span>
plant which manufactures machinery, has a total of 6,647 employees, including
1,225 Negro men and sixty Negro women. A representative of the company
said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Among the girls we had quite a lot of trouble in some departments against our
hiring colored girls. To every colored girl employed we lost five white girls. There
was friction in the washrooms due probably to race, though it may have been personal.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The report from a foundry employing 950 men, of whom 200 were colored,
said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

As a rule if any objection is made to working together it comes from the white
men (Polish) on the grounds that the colored man is being given the preference.

</p>
</div>

<p>
A laundry company employing ten Negroes out of a total of thirty-five
employees, reported that when the first Negro girl was employed the white
girls threatened to quit. The manager asked them to wait a week and, if
they still objected, he would let her go. There was no further objection;
they grew to like her.
</p>

<p>
The reports of employers regarding the absence of friction between white
and Negro workers is borne out by the testimony of Negro workers themselves.
Among 865 Negroes interviewed in all the industries covered, the number who
complained of disagreeable treatment by white workers was practically negligible.
It is possible that some Negro workers among those interviewed at their
work places, sometimes with white fellow-workers and foreman near by, felt
hesitancy in voicing such complaints. But the fact that the information was
sought by an investigator of their own race, and confidentially for the Commission,
may be considered as a factor likely to encourage the expression of
any grievance, especially if felt at all deeply.
</p>

<p>
Conditions of work in large foundries would seem to offer plenty of opportunity
for friction even where workers are all of the same race. This is particularly
true of foundries where the piecework system prevails. The work is
done in the confusion of smoke, heat, dust, and noise, with men shouting at
each other, each striving to be first to receive this pouring of molten iron from
the vats. Notwithstanding the fact that the work is carried on under great
tension, the ninety-three Negroes interviewed in fourteen foundries, when asked
how they got along with the white men with whom they worked, said: "Good,"
"Fine," or used other words to indicate friendly relations. Not a single complaint
was made against treatment by white workers in any of the foundries
or iron and steel establishments investigated.
</p>

<p>
One interesting instance of happy working relations in which several
nationalities of whites were involved was found at Hull-House. A Negro has
been in charge of the Coffee House there for six years. He had nine employees
working under him: three Negro girls, one German boy, one Greek man, two
Polish girls, and two Italian women. The Greek man and the two Polish
girls were in the employ of the Coffee House when he took charge. The others
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_396' name='Page_396' href='#Page_396'>396</a></span>
have all been employed for a considerable period. In commenting upon the
amicable relations of people representing so many different races and under a
Negro manager, he said, "We are all working for a living, and there will be
no discrimination. It is very simple. The thing to do is to get acquainted."
</p>

<h5>
2. WORKERS REFLECT ATTITUDE OF MANAGEMENT
</h5>

<p>
When the employment of Negroes is decided upon, there is an effort to
make the change with as little disturbance as possible to white workers. Frequently
the manager tries to imagine himself in the place of his white workers
in order to discover what their reaction will be. In so doing, he considers, not
what they will think or feel, but what a man with his own social background
would feel in their position. The attitude of the management therefore determines
whether Negro workers shall be segregated or treated like other workers
in the plant without regard to color. Separation once decided upon and partitions
erected, white workers may insist upon the distinction being maintained
where they would not have raised the point in the first instance. Establishments
following both courses gave the Commission the result of their experiences.
Of 101 establishments employing five or more Negroes each, eighteen
maintained separate lavatory and toilet accommodations for Negro workers.
This condition was accepted without complaint in some establishments, while
in others it was a source of dissatisfaction among the Negro workers, who
resented this manifestation of "Jim Crowism" in the North. The fact is
worthy of note that the eighteen establishments reporting separate accommodations
or separate departments for colored workers employed but 2,623 Negroes
out of a total of 22,337 covered by the investigation, or slightly more than
11 per cent. The remaining 89 per cent, or 19,714, were using all accommodations
in common with white workers.
</p>

<p>
One large foundry company employing 427 Negroes out of a total of
2,488 employees tried a different method in each of its three plants. In one
a partition in the locker and shower rooms was erected, to which the Negro
workers objected. The general superintendent said he would not have consented
to the erection of the partition in the first place, but he was afraid to
take it down. In the second plant separate lavatory accommodations were
provided in connection with separate departments for Negro and white workers
on different floors, and there was no trouble. In the third plant, where no
color distinctions were made, all workers using the same lavatory accommodations,
the manager never heard of any complaint from white or Negro
workers.
</p>

<p>
In another foundry employing 125 Negroes out of a total of 466 employees
the representative said that the Polish workers had objected "that the colored
people used the showers and basins all the time and they did not get a chance
to. We checked up on this and limited some of our showers to colored only,
and we only had two men use the white showers in something like two weeks,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' name='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
time, and in the colored there was something like 200 baths taken." The use
of the same accommodations in this plant caused no further complaint after
this incident. Another foundry reported that the white and Negro workmen
ate lunch and smoked together. There were no separate accommodations and
there was no ill-feeling whatever. Another firm employing 500 Negroes out
of a total of 3,000 employees reported: "The relationship between our Negro
and white employees is very friendly. During the past year we have not had
a single encounter of any kind between the white and colored workers. They
work together in most of our departments, use the same locker rooms and washrooms,
and eat in the same restaurant in the plant." In one foundry the
superintendent was nearly compelled to install separate accommodations
because of stealing in the locker rooms. Suspicion was aroused against the
Negro workers, and the white workers had a shop meeting to demand separate
accommodations. The manager said: "The same day the janitor caught a
red-headed Irish boy red-handed. We paraded him through the shop and
made quite a grandstand operation out of it, and it ended my troubles from
that time on, but if I hadn't caught him I might have had to maintain separate
locker rooms."
</p>

<p>
There were only six establishments which maintained separate departments
for Negro workers. In some cases segregation was effected by a partition;
in others by maintaining a complete Negro unit in a different part of the city.
The second plan has worked satisfactorily, but segregation by partition in the
same plant is resented by Negro workers. Representatives of the largest
employers of Negro labor expressed the opinion that erecting a partition, by
drawing the "color line," causes friction which in all probability would not
otherwise appear.
</p>

<p>
The industrial secretary of the Urban League, who has been actively interested
in extending the range of opportunity for the Negro in industry, firmly
believes that the attitude of the management on racial matters is reflected by
the employees, that wherever an uncompromising stand is made for fair play
for all employees, racial differences do not cause annoyance. He cites the
following incident as one of several tending to support his view:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

During the fall of 1919 the general manager of the Sâ€”â€” Fâ€”â€” Pâ€”â€” Company was
approached on the subject of employing colored girls. To our surprise, it was discovered
that colored girls were already employed by him in all branches of the industry,
and mixed freely with white employees. There was no discrimination in the character
or kind of work or the use of plant facilities. Mr. Nâ€”â€” explained that he had
never thought of segregating white and colored workmen, and the wisdom of his plan
had been proved by the experience of his father, who employs both white and colored
girls, but keeps the groups separated by a partition. According to Mr. Nâ€”â€” the partition
had been a source of trouble for the reason that the placing of the partition
itself indicated that the company intended to make a difference between white and
colored workers. This put each group in a frame of mind which caused them to
resent the presence of any worker on the side of the partition on which she was not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_398' name='Page_398' href='#Page_398'>398</a></span>
employed. The elder Mr. Nâ€”â€” realized his mistake but did not dare to take the
partition down, fearing that by so doing he would precipitate further trouble which
would result in the most desirable girls in each group quitting the plant.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Foremen, because they personify the management in the mind of the workmen,
play a large part in shaping the attitude white workers adopt toward
Negroes. If the foremen are antagonistic or insulting in their treatment of
the Negro, white workers find favor with the foremen by adopting the same
attitude. A construction company employing sixty Negroes reported:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

There were always difficulties with this gang when the Italian foreman was here,
as he constantly endeavored to place Italians at work displacing some very good
Negro workers. When I was sent here I dug under the difficulties and found the
Italians were very clannish and were using the foreman to carry out the plan of giving
every Italian who came along a job, at the expense of some Negro's job. I am a
French Canadian and have worked with colored men before. After failure in trying
to get Italians to see how bad the old system was, I was forced to let all the Italians
go. I have an excellent gang of Negroes now.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The representative of a large foundry said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

I believe I have a harder time to get the Polish foremen to handle Negro help
than any other. Our foremen are accustomed to handling the Polish workers pretty
rough. While employers don't want that, it goes on that way. A Pole is "cussed"
around and does not care what he is called. It's all the same to him, but a colored
man is a pretty thin-skinned individual. You call a colored man something, and he
will grab his hat and is gone. He thinks that when the foreman uses those words
he means it. He will not stand for the same kind of language that the Polak will.

</p>
</div>

<h5>
3. USE OF NEGRO LABOR TO UNDERMINE WAGES
</h5>

<p>
If Negroes are introduced into a plant during a strike and retained afterward,
a period of strained relations between white and Negro workers is
almost certain to ensue. They are given a similarly unfavorable start when
they are introduced to reduce labor costs. In the smaller establishments,
where wages and conditions of work were not well standardized, white workers
were suspicious that Negroes were working for lower wages, and the Negroes
suspected that they were being paid lower wages than white workers. It is
obvious that where mutual distrust and suspicion are present, friction readily
develops which may lead to serious social consequences.
</p>

<p>
To what extent Negroes are being paid lower wages than white workers it
is impossible to say. In this connection the Chicago Urban League made the
following statement:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The charge of inequality in the wages of white and colored workers is frequently
made, but the League is not always permitted to inquire into wage scales, and therefore
verification of some of these rumors has been impossible.
</p>

<p>
The League has taken up this matter with such companies as â€”â€”, â€”â€”, â€”â€”,
and numerous others, with the result that in each instance the statement has been
made that white and colored workers receive the same pay for the same work. There
is a deep-seated suspicion, however, that this is not true. In some cases this suspicion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_399' name='Page_399' href='#Page_399'>399</a></span>
seemed to be justified. Complaints have come to our attention where colored people
have been mistaken for white in the offices of the â€”â€” Company and employed at a
higher rate of pay than that given colored girls for similar work. This, however, has
never been verified. Pay inequalities have been explained away by larger experience,
seniority, superior production, etc., in favor of whites.
</p>

<p>
The employment manager of one company has told representatives of the Chicago
Urban League that the colored girls employed in their South Side Branch Office
started at a wage in excess of that given white girls for similar work in their main office.
</p>

<p>
The statement can be correctly made, however, that many employers of colored
girls, particularly in the needle trades, have refused to pay colored workers a wage
equal to that of white. There are well-known instances of sweatshop tactics used on
colored girls because of their inexperience in industry and lack of organization.
</p>

<p>
An official of the Women's Garment Workers' Union reported that â€”â€” Company,
upon finding that they had to pay the union scale of wages, requested the local
to supply white girls instead of the colored girls who were already in his employ.
The colored girls were employed to replace the striking whites.
</p>

<p>
No complaint has come to our attention of inequality of wages in union shops
employing white and colored workers, or in any of the larger industries. Colored
workers are usually exploited in the smaller shops. White workers have been known
to refuse to work in shops paying white and colored workers the same wage.

</p>
</div>

<p>
All of the representatives of employers appearing in conferences and all
but one of the representatives interviewed stated that Negro and white workers
were being paid equal wages in their establishments. The exception was a
wholesale hardware company where the employment manager admitted paying
Negroes "a dollar or two less per week" because they could not be shifted
from one department to another as readily as white workers on account of
prejudice of workers or foremen in certain departments.
</p>

<p>
It was learned that employers occasionally refuse to hire Negro unionists
when they learn they must pay them "white men's wages." Unionists allege
that even Negro employers object to paying Negroes the same union scale as
white workers. To the extent that Negro labor is being used to undermine
wage standards, misunderstanding and race friction develop.
</p>

<h5>
4. RELATIONS OF WHITE AND NEGRO WORKERS DURING THE RIOT
</h5>

<p>
In contrast with the violence that characterized street encounters during
the riots it is significant that no unfriendly demonstrations occurred between
workers in any of the establishments covered by the investigation, according
to statements made by representatives of employers. On the contrary, white
workers are said by employers to have expressed sympathy in many ways with
their Negro fellow-workers. The general superintendent of one of the largest
packing companies in the "Yards" emphasized the good feeling that existed
between the workers at this critical time:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

I think this Commission ought to know that there wasn't a single case of violence
in what we call Packingtown during the race riot, and the morning that the Negroes
were brought back to work in this packing-house there was not a single argumentâ€”there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_400' name='Page_400' href='#Page_400'>400</a></span>
wasn't a single indication in this plant of any racial feeling. In fact the two
classes of common labor we have are the Slavs and the Negroes, and they met as old
friends. In many instances they put their arms around one another's necks. In
one particular instance a Negro and a Pole got on an elevated truck and rode all
around this plant simply to signify to the rest of the workers that there was a good
spirit existing between the two. There was nothing in the contact between the Negro
and the Pole or the Slav that would indicate that there had ever been a race riot in
Chicago, and there was nothing from the beginning of the race riot to the end that
would indicate that there was any feeling started in the Stock Yards or in this industry
that led up to the race riot.

</p>
</div>

<p>
That there was at least one case of mob violence is shown by the report of
the coroner's jury which investigated the riots. William H. Dozier, a colored
man, was killed in the Stock Yards, according to this report. The jury's
finding in this case was:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

We find that during the race riots at a point about Cook Street and Exchange
Avenue in the Union Stock Yards, and at about 7:15 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, July 31, 1919, deceased, a
colored man, was struck by a hammer held and wielded by one Joseph Carka, that
the deceased ran east on Exchange Avenue toward the sheep pens at Morgan Street,
that he was followed and chased by a mob of white men, and that while so running
the deceased was struck by a street broom, held and wielded by one Joe Scovak, and
that he was also struck by a shovel in the hands of an unknown white man, and by
one or more stones or missiles thrown by one or more unknown white men; injuries
sustained causing death.

</p>
</div>

<p>
This was the only serious case of violence in the Stock Yards discovered,
although a number of rumors were investigated, which could not be substantiated
by facts.
</p>

<p>
Because of the nature of the work in the "Yards" and the presence of
knives and other dangerous implements which could be turned to ready use,
it is significant that more rioting, with deaths and injuries resulting, did not
take place. But it is also true that the riot, which started on Sunday afternoon,
became so serious by Monday morning that few Negroes made an effort
to reach their work at the Stock Yards.
</p>

<h4>
VII. FUTURE OF THE NEGRO IN CHICAGO INDUSTRIES
</h4>

<p>
The investigation of the Negro in industry points to the conclusion that
Negro labor has made a satisfactory record, and that there is little race friction
in evidence between white and Negro workers. What the future will hold for
him depends upon many complicating factors, some of which are: renewal of
immigration in large volume, depressed business conditions, attempted reductions
in labor costs, increasing unemployment, falling wages, the announced
determination of many employers' associations throughout the country to
undermine the strength of unions by establishing the "open shop" which might
involve the use of Negro labor, and the admitted prejudice of foremen against
Negro labor in many plants. It was labor shortage which forced employers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_401' name='Page_401' href='#Page_401'>401</a></span>
to experiment with Negro workers in new fields. Whether Negro employees
will be retained when a surplus of white labor is available is an open question.
</p>

<p>
Employers' representatives, in April and May, 1920, stated (with one
exception) that no reduction in labor force was contemplated; that when
such reduction became necessary, efficiency and seniority rights would determine
which workers would be retained; that the question of color would not
enter into the decision in any way. The employment manager of a firm
employing a very large number of Negroes expressed the general opinion of
the employers' representatives when he said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

I feel that our house will continue to run a colored office as long as they can run
it as efficiently and economically as they could a white office; while, on the other hand,
if they could not run it as efficiently and economically of course they wouldn't run it,
because it's just a matter of dollars and cents, and as far as charity and good will
goes, all good business men have it, but they are not going to run their business according
to that entirely.

</p>
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, the employment manager of an establishment which
had experienced friction between white and Negro workers was of the opinion
that white workers resented the intrusion of Negroes. He thought that this
feeling would be a factor if a time came when there was an oversupply of labor;
that Negroes would then have to give way because no employer would be strong
enough to resist the resentment of white workers; and Negro workers would
thus be thrown out of work and would be a standing menace to the community.
</p>

<p>
The investigations and inquiries of the Commission in industry took place
almost entirely in the period from March to September, 1920, and the statistics
concerning Negroes employed were gathered in the earlier part of this period.
During these months the general industrial situation was such as to demand
all the labor, both white and Negro, that could be secured. In the autumn of
1920, however, a period of decline began, with increasing unemployment. This
affected both white and Negro workers. Its own investigational staff no longer
available for additional service, the Commission sought information concerning
these changed conditions, so far as they affected Negro workers, from the
industrial secretary of the Chicago Urban League. Through its industrial
department the League places more Negroes in employment than any other
agency in Chicago. The industrial secretary made the following statement on
November 20:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

At the present time the unemployment among colored people has reached what
seems serious proportions. While there is no indication that colored people are suffering
more in this respect than any other group, the constantly swelling number is a
cause for grave concern. For three weeks our employment office has been crowded
with job seekers. At first it appeared that those who failed to take their work seriously
suddenly found themselves unable to get employment, but now hundreds of
men with good records have been forced out by temporary "shut downs" and reduced
forces of various plants.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' name='Page_402' href='#Page_402'>402</a></span>
</p>

<p>
During the working days included between November 15 and 20, our attendance
record is 1,073 job seekers with only 131 openings. One month ago the attendance
figure was 571 persons for the equal period (259 men and 312 women).
</p>

<p>
Our labor reports for May, 1920, indicated an attendance of 941 males and 739
females; about 1,000 orders for male help and about 500 for female help; there were
722 placements for males and 371 for females. The total attendance was 1,680;
orders, 1,500; placements, 1,093.
</p>

<p>
A casual survey including most of the leading industries ... shows a general
decline and a letting off of workers. Some few report difficulty in keeping their
present forces.
</p>

<p>
There have been some complaints of discrimination against colored workers, but
few comparatively.... Most industries are keeping their proportionate share of
Negroes. In some instances the proportion has been slightly increased....
</p>

<p>
During the week, workers have registered from cities in states from Mississippi to
Michigan. Detroit predominates, where the automobile industries show a marked
depression.
</p>

<p>
Women's work presents a very discouraging outlook. Hundreds of needle workers
are out of employment by the closing of many of the smaller shops which employed
colored girls. The Women's Trade Union League reports many workers unemployed,
due to the slowness of the trade. Immigrant white girls are said to be consuming
much of the work offered to domestics.... Colored women seem in most cases as
reluctant as ever to accept domestic employment.
</p>

<p>
The present unemployment problem is probably as serious as any the League
has known. What shall become of the army of jobless men is a problem serious and
perplexing.

</p>
</div>

<p>
As a result of the necessity of reducing costs in response to depressed
business conditions, managers of establishments employing both white and
Negro workers may be tempted to pit Negro and white workers against each
other, paying Negro labor less than white labor as a means of forcing down
wages or undermining labor-union organizations. Such attempts would
certainly be conducive to increased racial animosity. On the other hand,
managers who are hostile to Negro labor may take advantage of the change in
the labor situation by discharging Negroes indiscriminately, replacing them
with white workers.
</p>

<p>
During the period of business depression which had already begun, both
white and Negro workers seemed certain to lose some of the advantages which
they had gained as a result of the labor shortage caused by the war. After the
industrial depression has passed, discrimination against the Negro, to whatever
extent it may exist, will make the recovery of lost ground more difficult
for Negro workers than for white workers. In considering the question of
race discrimination, it is evident that the Negro who has lived in the North for
a number of years feels keenly the fact that color bars even the most capable
members of his race from the hope of promotion to executive or administrative
positions, while prejudice on the part of persons in authority prevents the rank
and file of Negroes from developing the degree of efficiency which they could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_403' name='Page_403' href='#Page_403'>403</a></span>
develop if they knew their efforts would be judged on merit alone. Where
advancement is precluded by color, the incentive supplied by recognition of
effort is lacking.
</p>

<p>
One door of escape from the discouraging prospects held out in industries
managed by white men, where there is no chance for promotion to executive
positions, is the opportunity for an increasing number of the more ambitious
Negroes to enter business among members of their own race. According to
Black's <i>Blue Book</i> (1919-20) there were over 1,200 Negro business houses and
professional offices in Chicago in 1920. Among others, the list included five
banks, forty dentists, fifteen druggists, twenty-four employment agencies,
six hotels, three insurance offices, forty-eight real estate offices, eleven newspapers
and magazines, 106 physicians, seventy lawyers, 161 barber shops and
billiard rooms, and 120 hairdressing parlors. Although the list of Negro
business men in Chicago is growing rapidly, it must necessarily remain but a
small percentage of the total Negro population. The great majority of Negroes
gainfully occupied will continue to be employees in industry. Therefore the
fact that a large number of Negroes feel that discrimination is practiced and
that, no matter what abilities they show, they can "go so far and no farther"
in industries managed by white men is of great importance in any consideration
of race problems. These men are the more thoughtful, aspiring members
of their race, and their opinion accordingly carries more weight than the opinion
of an equal number of care-free Negroes who may consider that the high wages
of the present are an offset for all handicaps. Negroes who feel keenly the
injustice of unequal opportunities are the ones to seek expression in Negro
newspapers and magazines with the aim of arousing widespread resentment
against race discrimination. Men who frequently would not resent discrimination
directed against themselves are stirred to resentment by well-told recitals
of injustice to others. Specific instances may seem to be of trifling importance,
but in being retold they reach an ever-widening audience, which is constantly
growing more race conscious.
</p>

<h3>
B. ORGANIZED LABOR AND THE NEGRO WORKER
</h3>

<h4>
I. INTRODUCTION
</h4>

<p>
Industry involves the continuous contact of more whites and Negroes than
any other field. It therefore affords wide opportunity for the operation of
racial misunderstanding and friction. It is also a field in which the lines of
economic interest are so tightly drawn and so closely watched that any misunderstanding
or friction is thereby greatly accentuated.
</p>

<p>
Irritation and clashes of interest have been conspicuous in the relations
between labor unions and Negro workers. This friction has extended to the
relations between whites and Negroes generally. The efforts of union labor
to promote its cause and gain adherents have built up a body of sentiment
that cannot easily be opposed by non-union workers. The strike breaker is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_404' name='Page_404' href='#Page_404'>404</a></span>
intolerable to the union man. Circumstances have frequently made Negroes
strike breakers, thus centering upon them as a racial group all the bitterness
which the unionist feels toward strike breakers as a class. This tends to
increase any existing racial antipathy or to serve as concrete justification
for it.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Negroes have often expressed themselves as distrustful
of the unions because prejudice in the unions has denied them equal benefits
of membership. They often find that their first opportunity in a new industry
comes through the eagerness of a strike-bound employer to utilize their labor
at wages more than they have previously earned, even if less than the union
scale. This often tends to make them feel that they have more to gain through
affiliation with such employers than by taking chances on what the unions
offer them.
</p>

<p>
There is a gradually increasing sympathetic understanding by unionists
of the struggle of Negroes to overcome their handicaps, and an increasing realization
of the importance to the unions of organizing them. Negroes are
themselves showing more interest in efforts toward organizations, but there
is still much mutual suspicion and resentment in their relations.
</p>

<p>
To understand these relations it is necessary to know (1) the policy and
attitude of organized labor toward the Negro and how its expressed policy is
carried out in practice; and (2) what the Negro believes the facts to be and
what his attitude is toward organized labor. In its investigation the Commission
used the following methods of inquiry: Questionnaires were sent to
all labor organizations; interviews were held with union officials and members,
both white and Negro, with officers and members of Negro "protest" unions,
with non-union Negroes, and with persons who were not connected with unions
but had certain special information. Ninety-one persons, of whom twenty-five
were Negroes, were interviewed. Trade-union meetings were attended
by the Commission's investigator. Union constitutions, magazines, convention
reports, etc., were collected and studied. Conferences were held by the
Commission at which the following labor leaders and organizers presented their
information and views:
</p>

<p>
George W. Perkins, president of the International Cigarmakers' Union,
and prominent in the affairs of the American Federation of Labor since its
organization.
</p>

<p>
Victor Olander, secretary-treasurer, Illinois State Federation of Labor,
and vice-president of International Seaman's Union.
</p>

<p>
John Fitzpatrick, president, Chicago Federation of Labor.
</p>

<p>
W. Z. Foster, organizer of the American Federation of Labor in the steel
and packing industries.
</p>

<p>
A. K. Foote, Negro, vice-president of Stock Yards Labor Council and
secretary-treasurer, Local 651, Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen
of America.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' name='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>405</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I. H. Bratton, Negro organizer for Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher
Workmen of America.
</p>

<p>

Stock Yards district.
</p>

<p>
Max Brodsky, secretary-treasurer, Local 100, International Ladies' Garment
Workers' Union.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Maloney, treasurer and organizer, Chicago Waitresses' Union.
</p>

<p>
Robert L. Mays, Negro, president of an independent Negro union, the
Railway Men's International Benevolent and Industrial Association.
</p>

<h4>
II. POLICY OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND OTHER
FEDERATIONS
</h4>

<p>
From its beginning the American Federation of Labor has declared a
uniform policy of no racial discrimination, although this policy has not been
carried out in practice by all the constituent autonomous bodies. At its
fortieth annual convention, held at Montreal, Canada, in June, 1920, a plan
was presented to "use every means in its power to have the words 'only white'
members stricken out of the constitution" of the Brotherhood of Railway
Clerks, an organization which exercises jurisdiction over 100,000 colored
employees, although barring them from membership, and "admit the colored
workers to full membership in their Brotherhood or have them relinquish
jurisdiction" over these Negro employees and allow them to establish a brotherhood
of their own.
</p>

<p>
This failed to receive favorable action, but a resolution was passed reaffirming
the position taken at the Atlantic City convention in 1919 that "where
international unions refuse to admit colored workers to membership, the
American Federation of Labor will be authorized to organize them under
charters from the American Federation of Labor." This means that in such
cases the American Federation of Labor itself becomes the national or international
union of such locals. According to the information given to the
Commission by George W. Perkins, "the American Federation of Labor has
organized hundreds of local unions and thereby directly attached to the
American Federation of Labor colored workers." President Gompers states:
"Of the 900 unions affiliated directly with the American Federation of Labor
there are 169 composed exclusively of Negroes."
</p>

<p>
A brief reference to the history of the national federations which preceded
the American Federation of Labor shows that the foregoing policy has been
followed since shortly after the Civil War.
</p>

<p>
The National Labor Union (1866-72), at its first convention in 1866, was
the first national federation of labor unions to deal with the problem of meeting
Negro competition after the Civil War. The formation of trades unions
among colored people was favored. In 1869 Negro delegates were admitted
to the annual convention. A separate national Negro Labor Union, formed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_406' name='Page_406' href='#Page_406'>406</a></span>
in 1869, was short-lived. The unfriendly attitude of the unions toward the
Negroes was the subject of bitter comment at the various sessions of the
latter organization. The Knights of Labor, which rose to prominence after
the decline of the National Labor Union, admitted all workers without regard
to color. Many Negroes in the South joined the organization. When the
leadership of organized labor shifted from the Knights of Labor to the American
Federation of Labor in the late eighties, the Federation continued to express
the policy of no racial discrimination and has stood for that policy to the present
time.<a name='FA_75' id='FA_75' href='#FN_75' class='fnanchor'>[75]</a> At the convention of the American Federation of Labor in Atlantic
City, 1919, there were present about fifty Negro delegates, men and women.
A large number of Negro delegates also attended the last convention of the
Federation at Montreal.
</p>

<p>
The policy of the Illinois State Federation of Labor was outlined to the
Commission by Victor Olander, secretary-treasurer, as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The State Federation of Labor is under the jurisdiction of the American Federation
of Labor, and the laws governing the national would necessarily govern the state
federation, so that in respect to law they are the same. I might add that they are
carrying out the law in much the same manner with respect to the Negro. There
hasn't been a convention of the Illinois State Federation of Labor held in many years
that hasn't had in attendance Negro delegates. That is the usual thing at every
convention. There is no discrimination.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The Chicago Federation of Labor is the city central body of the various
local unions in Chicago which are connected with the American Federation of
Labor. Each of these local unions elects delegates to represent it at the
semi-monthly meetings of the Chicago Federation. Negro delegates take an
active part in these meetings, and are cordially received. The Federation and
its president have been very active in all efforts to organize Negroes, especially
in the Stock Yards, the steel industry, and the culinary trades.
</p>

<h4>
III. POLICY OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL UNIONS
</h4>

<p>
In considering the policy of national and international unions, that of the
unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor will be discussed first,
and following this the policy of six of the most important of the independent
internationals.
</p>

<h5>
1. UNIONS AFFILIATED WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR
</h5>

<p>
The American Federation of Labor has consistently followed a policy of
no racial discrimination. It has, however, no power to compel its constituent
national and international unions to follow this policy. The question of race
discrimination by an autonomous national or international union has been
frequently the subject of spirited discussion at American Federation of Labor
conventions, but the outcome has been merely a recommendation to the
offending union that the discrimination be discontinued. Since strict autonomy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_407' name='Page_407' href='#Page_407'>407</a></span>
of national and international unions is recognized in the constitution of
the American Federation of Labor, no more effective action can be taken.
</p>

<p>
In order to learn the racial policy of the 110 nationals and internationals
affiliated with the American Federation of Labor inquiries were sent to each,
and direct responses were received from sixty-nine. The policy of twenty-five
additional unions was learned through their district councils or locals in
Chicago. Thus all but sixteen of the 110 national and international unions
in the American Federation of Labor were covered. Of these, two were
suspended from the American Federation of Labor in 1919-20. Only three
have locals in Chicago, and all have little significance for Chicago. Information
concerning the racial policy of the sixteen unions not heard from was
supplied by labor leaders in touch with the whole union situation and able to
speak with authority on this subject.
</p>

<p>
Of the 110 national and international unions affiliated with the American
Federation of Labor, eight expressly bar the Negro by their constitutions or
rituals. These unions are: Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America,
International Association of Machinists, American Association of Masters,
Mates, and Pilots, Railway Mail Association, Order of Railroad Telegraphers,
the Commercial Telegraphers' Union of America, American Wire Weavers'
Protective Association, and Brotherhood of Railway Mail Clerks.
</p>

<p>
Thus 102 of the 110 national and international unions affiliated with the
American Federation of Labor admit Negroes. Not all of these unions, however,
have Negro members, notwithstanding the fact that Negroes are eligible
to membership. In accounting for the absence of Negro members, twenty-eight
national and international unions reported "no Negroes in the trade,"
or "no applications ever received." Certain of the 102 nationals and internationals
reported a small Negro membership with the following explanations:
</p>

<p>
Eleven stated that employers discriminated against Negro members of
the unionâ€”wanted white men if they had to pay the union scale of wages.
</p>

<p>
Seven internationals and five delegate bodies reported that special efforts
were now being made to organize Negro workers.
</p>

<p>
Twelve internationals called attention to long periods of apprenticeshipâ€”four
had a three-year period, six a four-year period, and two a five-year periodâ€”as
a factor which accounted for the failure of Negroes to join.
</p>

<p>
In their comments, some of these union officials unconsciously express
their prejudice, sometimes attributing traits to the Negro which they seem to
take for granted as being characteristic. The following are some examples:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

No Negroes have applied for membership in our union or did not have nerve
enough as it requires lots of climbing.
</p>

<p>
We do not have any Negroes in our organization, but there is nothing in the constitution
which prevents them from becoming members after they have learned the
trade. No one has ever made application for a Negro. I judge this is because they
have to blow in the same pipe [in glass blowing].
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_408' name='Page_408' href='#Page_408'>408</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I find nothing in our laws which bars Negroes from becoming members of this
union, but in my thirteen years in this office I have never known one to make application
for membership. This may be due to the hazardous nature of our work.
</p>

<p>
Ours is usually very hard work. Negroes as a whole do not like hard work. They
instead very often prefer employment where they can get along at their own gait or
in their own way, especially working in gangs.

</p>
</div>

<p>
National and international unions which had Negro members in appreciable
numbers reported the following facts:
</p>

<p>
Sixteen had Negro officers or organizers.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-three reported that relations between the races in the unions were
undisturbed by race prejudice.
</p>

<p>
Thirty-three stated that Negroes had belonged to the union for the following
periods:

<h5>
2. UNIONS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR
</h5>

<p>
There are a number of unions<a name='FA_76' id='FA_76' href='#FN_76' class='fnanchor'>[76]</a> not affiliated with the American Federation
of Labor, of which the most important are: the four railway brotherhoodsâ€”Brotherhood
of Railway Clerks, Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and
Enginemen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, Order of Railway Conductors
of Americaâ€”Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; Industrial Workers
of the World (I.W.W.). The four railway brotherhoods exclude the Negro by
constitutional provision. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and
the Industrial Workers of the World admit the Negro and make special efforts
to organize Negro workers. The I.W.W. has its main foothold in the lumber,
mine, and textile industries and does not have any strong unions in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Disregarding the classification of nationals and internationals based upon
affiliation with the American Federation of Labor, a review of the figures
presented above shows that 104 national and international unions admit the
Negro, and that twelve exclude the Negro by written provision.
</p>

<p>
The outstanding fact with reference to these twelve organizations is that,
with the exception of the Wire Weavers, they are all connected with the transportation
industry: seven are members of the American Federation of Labor
Railway Department and the other four constitute the big "railway brotherhoods."
The latter are sometimes referred to by members of the unions as
the "aristocrats in the labor movement." All of these unions, except the
Masters, Mates, and Pilots, have been organized more than twenty years.
None of the unions formed within the last twenty years, except the Masters,
Mates, and Pilots, excludes the Negro.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_409' name='Page_409' href='#Page_409'>409</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In these crafts, excepting such trades as carmen, machinists, clerks, and
firemen, it may be that in general the Negro would not be much of a factor
at present, because these trades demand an amount of education and skill not
yet possessed by a large percentage of Negroes. But this by no means proves
that the Negro would not acquire the necessary skill and education if opportunities
in these trades were actually open to him.
</p>

<p>
The Railway Department of the American Federation of Labor is composed
of fourteen craft unions, all but two of which exclude the Negro worker. The
Stationary Firemen and Oil Men of the American Federation of Labor Railway
Department are openly soliciting Negro members. The only other craft
organization which admits Negroes is the Maintenance of Way Craft, which
really means the common labor group. Negroes can get into this craft through
an auxiliary charter to a Negro local. Regardless of how skilled or how
intelligent the applicant may be, or how logically he falls into some other craft,
he can only come in through one or the other of these two craft unions.
</p>

<p>
The attitude of the railway brotherhoods is typified in remarks made to
an investigator for the Commission by a member of the Brotherhood of Railway
Clerks who is now serving on an important public commission. He
was emphatic in upholding the brotherhood's policy of excluding Negroes.
"As long as the engineers have anything to say about it, they certainly will
not get in." He said that the modern locomotive was a highly complicated
and scientific mechanism, and that the Negroes "did not have brains enough
to run one."
</p>

<p>
As showing the contrasting view of another trade-union man, an employee
of the public commission mentioned said that he had been a member of the
United Mine Workers since 1901, and in that organization no color line is
drawn; that he had worked beside Negro miners and feels no prejudice. He
pointed out that the national conventions of the miners always have a large
representation of Negro delegates, and some of the ablest and best speakers
come from the Negro race. He expressed the feeling that the policy of the
railway brotherhoods is a mistake, and is a case of "swell-headedness."
</p>

<p>
The general exclusion policy of the railway brotherhoods and certain of
the unions in the Railway Department of the American Federation of Labor
has created a feeling of bitterness among Negroes which spreads beyond these
crafts and is directed against unions in general, notwithstanding the constructive
and progressive policy of the many unions which admit Negroes. In the transportation
crafts it has led to the formation of a "protest" Negro railway union.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Railway Men's International Benevolent Industrial Association.</i>â€”This
organization is a labor union open to Negro railway employees. It is a protest
organization which has grown up because of the exclusion of Negroes by the
railway brotherhoods and certain unions in the Railway Department of the
American Federation of Labor.
</p>

<p>
The Association was organized May 12, 1915, and has seventeen locals in
Chicago and a membership of about 1,200, all railway employees. The leaders
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_410' name='Page_410' href='#Page_410'>410</a></span>
of this group disclaimed any intention of building up "a rival American Federation
of Labor among Negroes," but stated that, as far as they were personally
concerned, they would be willing to affiliate with the American Federation of
Labor in its proper department, <i>providing</i> all forms of discrimination in national
and international unions, both in constitution and practice, were done away
with, and the Negro worker was assured of equal treatment and opportunity
with the white worker. They realize that the highest welfare of both groups
depends upon co-operation. But, as to what the membership would want to
do when that time comes, they of course do not know.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mays, the president of the organization, was asked by the Commission's
investigator what he would do in a situation where both Negroes
and whites were organized separately, and the whites were going out on a strike
and had requested the Negroes to come out also. He stated that several such
local strike situations had arisen in the South, and that he had advised the
Negro union in each of these cases to use its own judgment, but that if it
decided to support the white unions, it should, before doing so, have a joint
committee of both groups meet and make it understood absolutely that any
agreement finally reached with the employers must include both groups on
equal terms. In one case, after such an agreement had been reached and the
men had gone back to work, the employer tried to keep out certain Negroes, but
the white unionists insisted that the agreement must be lived up to.
</p>

<p>
The officials of this organization are exceptionally capable Negroes; its
advisers are professional men, well educated and thoroughly familiar with the
history and tactics of white labor unions.
</p>

<p>
A more definite statement of the purpose and policies of this protest organization
was made before the Commission by R. L. Mays:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The Railway Men's International Benevolent Industrial Association really protests
as an organization against unfair and bad working conditions of the employer
and against unfair practices on the part of the American Federation of Labor and the
railway brotherhoods.
</p>

<p>
This is the crux of the problem as we see it. We agree with the policies and
principles of the American Federation of Labor so long as they are American and in
the interests of the workmen, but if their practices are against Negroes, then we are
against the American Federation of Labor unflinchingly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: To what extent have you found their practices unfair to the colored
people?
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Mays</i>: There are fourteen unions in railway employment in the American
Federation of Labor. The United Brotherhood of Railway Employees has been
accepting Negroes in full membership, but the other thirteen organizations do not
accept Negroes in membership. As a matter of fact, they are secured on contract,
which is the greatest holdback for the Negroes and breeds more distrust on the part
of the Negro in these places, so far as the American Federation of Labor is concerned.
</p>

<p>
Before the roads were under government control certain discriminatory practices
were found in the South, but now you will find colored men in certain skilled positions.
In the Brotherhood of Carmen, if a colored man is not organized into the local union,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' name='Page_411' href='#Page_411'>411</a></span>
he cannot advance automatically from repair to car building. He might be a member
of one of these local unions chartered by and affiliated with the American Federation
of Labor. But under contract they say their members must be white, and they use
only white men. In the South our men have enjoyed these jobs; under war conditions
they were brought here, but under this contract no Negro can be employed
as a carman, although he has all the experience in the world. They refuse to take the
colored man but take the white man. No colored boy can go in as an apprentice and
work up to a skilled mechanic's position. Consequently they are reducing the
Negro railway worker to a position of common laborer and automatically are keeping
him down. If this is the condition in the railways in the North, I say it will prevail
everywhere. I have said that it is a northern prejudice coming South.

<h4>
IV. ATTITUDE AND POLICY OF LOCAL UNIONS IN CHICAGO
</h4>

<h5>
1. WHITE AND NEGRO MEMBERSHIP IN CHICAGO LOCAL UNIONS
</h5>

<p>
Much effort was made to obtain statistics of white and Negro membership
in local trade unions in Chicago. Information was sought through requests
addressed to the national headquarters of all national and international
unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor for data as to any
local unions they might have in Chicago. Requests were also addressed
directly to these local unions as listed in a directory published by the Chicago
Trade Union Label League. Further requests were addressed to local unions
in Chicago directly affiliated with the American Federation of Labor as listed
in a directory of all such unions published by that organization.
</p>

<p>
It was difficult to ascertain the exact number of local unions in Chicago.
Those covered embraced, however, as full a list as could be supplied by trade-union
offices in Chicago. But the president of the Chicago Federation of Labor
said that the number of local unions was changing so continually by reason of
the organization of new ones and the consolidation of two or more into one,
that no accurate list was available.
</p>

<p>
Data for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and for the
Railway Men's International Industrial Benevolent Association were obtained
directly from those organizations.
</p>

<p>
Reports were received from the railway brotherhoods saying that they
exclude Negroes, but giving no data as to the number of white members.
</p>

<p>
The information which was obtained may be summarized as follows:
</p>

<table summary="Railway Brotherhoods">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Members</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdh">371 local unions affiliated with the American Federation of
  Labor, comprising locals of national and international unions
  so affiliated, and also federal and local unions directly
  affiliated with the American Federation of Labor</td>
<td class="tdr">253,237</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdh">11 local unions of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of
  America</td>

  Benevolent Association</td>

</table>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_412' name='Page_412' href='#Page_412'>412</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The total Negro membership reported for Chicago by the foregoing organizations
was 12,106. The number of locals through which this Negro membership
was distributed cannot be stated with any approach to accuracy, due to
the fact that in a number of cases the district council or the national body
reported the membership for its Chicago locals jointly. In such cases it
could not safely be assumed that each of the locals in question had Negro
members. Disregarding all such cases, however, there still remains a total of
at least eighty-five Chicago locals for which, individually, Negro members were
reported.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that, judging by the figures here shown as to white
and Negro membership in local unions in Chicago, the proportion of Negro
union members to the Negro population in Chicago is almost exactly the same
as the proportion of white members to the white population in Chicago.
</p>

<h5>
2. METHODS OF DEALING WITH NEGRO APPLICANTS
</h5>

<p>
If the unions which bar the Negro are chosen as examples, organized labor
might appear to be very unfair to Negro workers. On the other hand, if
unions which admit them into the same locals and have Negro organizers and
officers are chosen as examples, it might appear that there was no prejudice
whatever against Negroes on the part of trade unions. Neither extreme would
represent the facts. On the basis of policy toward the Negro, unions in Chicago
may be divided into four classes or types. These classes are:
</p>

<p>
A. Unions admitting Negroes to white locals.
</p>

<p>
B. Unions admitting Negroes to separate co-ordinate locals.
</p>

<p>
C. Unions admitting Negroes to subordinate or auxiliary locals.
</p>

<p>
D. Unions excluding Negroes from membership.
</p>

<p>
The existence of these classes indicates the fact that the union attitude and
policy toward the Negro cannot be summed up by any simple generalization.
Each class or type has its own policy, and even within the class there are minor
variations of attitude and policy.
</p>

<h6>
A. UNIONS ADMITTING NEGROES TO WHITE LOCALS
</h6>

<p>
Wherever and whenever Negroes are admitted on an equal basis and given
a square deal, the feeling inside the union is nearly always harmonious. This
is true in such unions as the Butcher Workmen's, Hodcarriers', Flat Janitors',
and Ladies' Garment Workers', which include important fields of Negro
labor in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
<i>Stock Yards' unions.</i>â€”The Stock Yards' strike of 1904 was broken by the
use of Negroes. This was the opening wedge for the admittance to the union
of the large number of Negroes which followed. No organization thereafter
could hope to amount to anything in the Yards unless it took in Negroes.
From 1917 until the riot of 1919 Negroes in large numbers were joining the
Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen's Union of North America.
Forty locals were formed. The Negro was welcome to join any local he desired,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_413' name='Page_413' href='#Page_413'>413</a></span>
whether it was predominantly Polish or Irish or Negro. However, the majority
gravitated to Local 651, which was composed mainly of Negroes and had Negro
officers and organizers and headquarters near the "Black Belt."
</p>

<p>
This was not unnatural, since the headquarters of the various local unions
are distributed over the city with a view to their convenience for the members.
Most of the Negro members live within the "Black Belt." The most active
Negro organizer in the city is connected with this local. Negroes living outside
this area belong to the locals nearest their homes.
</p>

<p>
Efforts to organize Negro workers in the Yards are commented upon in
the <i>Negro Year Book</i> of 1918-19 in the following paragraph:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

That the unions are doing much to organize Negro labor is indicated by the
fact that of the more than ten thousand Negro workers in the Chicago packing houses,
over 60 per cent are reported in the unions. The International Union of Butchers'
Workmen, which has jurisdiction over 90 per cent of the employees in the packing
houses of the country, has three paid Negro organizers. In other lines of work there
is equal activity in organizing Negro labor.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The unions succeeded in securing an agreement under which Judge Samuel
Alschuler was mutually accepted by the packing companies and the unions as
an arbitrator on matters affecting working conditions in the Yards, especially
hours and wages. This agreement applies to all who work in the Yards,
whether in or out of the union, but, according to labor leaders, union action
and union money "put it across." Consequently there was the feeling that
all who benefited should join and help share in the expense, and a feeling of
hostility toward such Negroes, and whites as well for that matter, who did not
join because they found that they could get all the benefits of the arrangement
without paying dues.
</p>

<p>
While the Commission's investigator was interviewing the officials of one
of the unions of the packing industry at their headquarters, a number of the
white members dropped in to pay their dues. In conversation they showed,
quite unsolicited, that considerable feeling existed because the Negro workers
were not coming into the union. They felt that the Negroes were receiving
all the benefits secured for the workers by the unions without paying their
proportion of the expense of the organization. In fact, several used rather
strong terms with the words "fink" and "scabs."
</p>

<p>
The sentiment of the men present seemed to be that, while mistakes had
been made on both sides in the 1904 strike and since, the antagonistic feeling
had been pretty largely eliminated, as was shown by the large Negro membership
prior to the riot, and they said that every effort was being made at that
time and since to bring the Negro into the union. Conferences had been held
with Negro ministers and other organizations explaining the position of the
unions, literature had been distributed, and a great deal of money had been
spent through Negro organizers, and yet the results were disappointingly
small. These white union men contended that they were opposed by an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_414' name='Page_414' href='#Page_414'>414</a></span>
effective combination of "packers'" influence hard to beat and intensively
interested in keeping the races apart for its own purposes in opposing union
organization.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Hod Carriers</i> have sixteen locals in Chicago with a large total membership.
No racial record is kept, but Negroes are admitted without discrimination
into all of the unions. A few years ago the Negro membership was between
1,200 and 1,400; at present with an increase of 300 to 500 from the South, the
secretary of the executive council estimates the total Negro membership to
be at least 1,700, most of whom have joined two locals. The president of
the Evanston union and the vice-president of the Chicago Heights union are
colored. No feeling of discrimination exists, all being treated alike as long
as they pay their dues and live up to the rules. The Hod Carriers have joint
arbitration agreements with the employing contractors' associations in this
industry, and no strikes have been called since 1900.
</p>

<p>
<i>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union</i> is another illustration
of a union which accords Negroes the same treatment as white members, and
where the relationship is entirely harmonious. This union has never drawn
the race, creed, or color line and is trying to leave out the word "white" and
"colored" from its minutes and reports. The Negro girls came into this
industry as strike breakers within the last three years.
</p>

<p>
The officials of this union, in interviews and in testimony before the Commission,
claimed that whenever any friction did arise it was due to the fact
that the employers in this industry discriminated against Negro girls and paid
them less than white girls. The agreement between the ladies' garment
manufacturers and the union provided a weekly wage of $37.40 for skirt and
dress operatorsâ€”85 cents per hour for a forty-four-hour week. Negro operators
in non-union factories for the same work were being paid from $18.00
to $25.00 per week. Union skirt and dress finishers were being paid $26.40
per weekâ€”60 cents per hour for forty-four hours. Negro operators in non-union
factories averaged $15.00 per week for the same work and frequently
worked longer than forty-four hours.
</p>

<p>
The relations of whites and Negroes in the union were discussed before the
Commission by Max Brodsky, a representative of the union, who said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

As a result of the 1917 strike we have now about 450 colored women workers in
our industry. We lost the strike, and this is how the colored women got into our
industry. Now the union knew the object of the colored women coming into our
industry, and we decided to have them organized just like the white women and girls,
so we established this particular union. They are at present conscientious union
girls and women. It was the policy of the union not to discriminate against the colored
women who broke the strike in 1917. This helped us.

</p>
</div>

<p>
At the same conference, Agnes Nestor, president of the Women's Trade
Union League, testified as follows:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_415' name='Page_415' href='#Page_415'>415</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

<i>Miss Nestor</i>: In the ladies' garments work, the unions have taken in colored
girls on the same basis as the white girls. They made a colored girl a chairman of
their shop meeting. There is no feeling there with them as far as I know.
</p>

<p>
<i>Miss McDowell</i>: Didn't they elect a colored girl as shop steward where they had
both white and colored girls?
</p>

<p>
<i>Miss Nestor</i>: Yes.

</p>
</div>

<p>
As an illustration of employers' discrimination against Negro workers, and
of the efforts of the union to protect Negroes when they become members of
the union, the case of a manufacturer was cited whose shop had only Negro
workers. Shortly after the union had organized them they were locked out.
Later the employer was willing to settle "providing you sent us a set of white
workers." The union refused to do this and called a strike.
</p>

<p>
The union claimed that in many recent cases where Negro girls were sent
out on jobs the employers would refuse them when they found out that they
had to pay them the same scale as white workers. During 1917-18, owing to
the war, the manufacturers worked in harmony with the unions because they
had to; since the war, and largely within the first few months of 1920, the
manufacturers have opened many shops on the South Side employing only
non-union colored girls. In the various strikes in which this union has been
engaged for this same period, the strike breakers have been Negro girls secured
for the employers through a Negro minister acting as a labor agent or solicitor.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Flat Janitors' Union</i> has a membership of approximately 5,000, of
whom 1,000 are Negroes. It includes many nationalities with strong racial
feelings, yet, as stated by Mr. Fitzpatrick, president of the Chicago Federation
of Labor, rarely is any complaint made against this union by Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Interviews with the president and other officials, attendance at a session
of the Executive Board, and attendance at a crowded meeting of the union,
where transaction of general business, nomination of candidates for the coming
election, and initiation of new members occurred, gave the Commission's
investigator ample opportunity for observation of the attitude toward Negroes.
</p>

<p>
This union, organized in 1904, started out with a Negro as recording
secretary and business agent. At the time of the interviews, the vice-president
and three members of the Executive Board were Negroes. These had been
elected for a three-year term. At the general meeting attended, the Negro
officers were renominated unanimously to hold office for a period of five years.
In addition, several more Negroes were nominated as stewards and as delegates
to the Chicago Federation of Labor.
</p>

<p>
According to the members, discrimination in this craft is practiced by the
flat and apartment owners. The experience of the union is that as soon as a
Negro is taken into the union and demands the union scale the owner calls up
the union and says, "If I have to pay these wages I'm going to get a good white
man."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' name='Page_416' href='#Page_416'>416</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The position taken by the union is that if a Negro has had the job he must
be allowed to stay there and get the scale, and the union will back him up in
the fight for it. The threat of a strike against a building is usually effective.
</p>

<p>
Inquiry among Negro janitors in the residence districts brought up a case
in which one Negro claimed that Negroes were forced into the union and then
usually found themselves discriminated against by the white members, especially
by Belgians, and soon or later, were squeezed out of the good jobs. However,
this Negro admitted that he had not attended a union meeting since his
initiation, except to stop in to pay his dues, and that he had never made a
complaint to the Negro officer of the union. The officers of the union admitted
that there was, in the many racial groups in this craft, strong racial feeling,
especially among Austrians and Belgians, who seemed to feel that whenever a
janitor died or left the job, or an assistant or helper was needed, such job
should always be filled with members of their own nationality. However, the
Negro officials claimed that with three Negroes on the Executive Board and
a Negro vice-president, any complaint coming from a Negro would surely be
fairly dealt with; but that unless their attention was called to unsatisfactory
conditions the union could not be expected to know of them, and in such cases
it was not the union that was to blame, but the member himself.
</p>

<p>
Frequently, in those unions in which the Negroes are not admitted into
the same locals with the whites, the reasons given for putting them into separate
locals or auxiliaries is that the white members object to the close physical
contact or association in meetings, especially where there is some element of
ritual in connection with the meetings. At the meeting of the Janitors'
Union attended by the investigator, new pass words were given out, and all
members, white and Negro, had to come before the Negro vice-president, who
whispered the words to each and they in turn repeated them to him. Not the
slightest hesitancy was noted on the part of the white members, but rather a
hearty handshake or a slap on the back seemed to be the rule. Again, in taking
in nineteen new members, four of whom were Negroes, the major part of the
ceremony was performed by the Negro vice-president. At this meeting, packed
to standing-room and attended by well over a thousand members, Negroes were
a large percentage of those present. These were not confined to a group by
themselves, but were scattered in all parts of the hall and seemed to be in
cordial conversation with the white members.
</p>

<p>
A number of interesting comments by members and officers of unions
admitting Negroes on equal terms with whites were volunteered, either in
interviews or in correspondence. In one union of 700 highly skilled workers
receiving $1.50 an hour, or $12.00 a day, no Negroes were found to be members,
although they are not barred by the constitution. It was suggested that the
five-year apprenticeship period discouraged Negroes. It was further noted
that admittance was by a two-thirds vote, a provision which could easily result
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' name='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>417</a></span>
in the exclusion of any race which two-thirds of the members did not like. The
investigator's report of his interview says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

The business representative of this union was strongly of the personal opinion that
unions had made a mistake in ever admitting the Negro into any of the unions. He
claimed that the employers' only interest in them was as a lever to keep wages down
for the workers.
</p>

<p>
Two other members of the League took a contrary position and held that Negro
labor was in the field, and that while the employer's interest in the Negro was simply
to play one group against another to keep expense down as low as possible, it was really
up to labor itself to solve the question and that the Negroes must be taken into unions.
They admitted that undoubtedly prejudice existed, but that it was gradually being
overcome.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Other comments are as follows:
</p>

<p>
From an officer of the Teamsters and Chauffeurs: "We have had one
Negro holding office as trustee for several years. So feeling is brotherly."
</p>

<p>
From an officer of a specialized mechanics' union: "There has been no sign
of race feeling or hatred since we have been organized. We have six officers
(one colored). I myself, being colored, have no complaints whatever against
my white brothers."
</p>

<p>
From a Negro officer of the Mattress Makers: "Discrimination and race
prejudice does not exist in this union. We are one happy family. It seems
impossible to organize the other Negro mattress makers. Would appreciate
some assistance."
</p>

<h6>
B. UNIONS ADMITTING NEGROES TO SEPARATE CO-ORDINATE LOCALS
</h6>

<p>
Certain unions organize Negroes into separate locals which are in all
respects co-ordinate with the white locals belonging to the same unions. The
reason for maintaining separate Negro locals is either (1) preference of the
Negro workers for locals of their own, or (2) unwillingness of white workers to
admit Negroes to white locals. It often seemed that the second indicated the
real situation, the first reason being given as an excuse for it.
</p>

<p>
The important factor is the reason for the existence of separate Negro locals
rather than the fact of separation. This is illustrated by the experience of
the Painters' and Musicians' unions on the one hand, and that of the Waiters'
Union on the other.
</p>

<p>
During July, 1920, twenty Negro painters applied to the Painters' District
Council for membership in the Painters' Union. They passed the required
examination but, instead of being placed in the existing Painters' Union, were
given temporary working permits which identified them as members of "South
Side Colored Local." They immediately suspected that some effort was being
made to place them in a separate Negro local in which they could not get the
full benefits of union membership. They then went to discuss the matter with
the editor of a Negro paper which had expressed the point of view of many
Negroes concerning labor unions in its editorial columns. This editor told
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_418' name='Page_418' href='#Page_418'>418</a></span>
them his belief that the Painters' District Council was merely duplicating the
practices of several other unions in the city, and was attempting to limit
these men to a "Jim Crow" union. They returned to the president of the
District Council, who explained that he had to keep track of all temporary
permits issued, and inasmuch as the charter for their local was not yet issued
he could not know the number until issued. He had to put the description
on the cards to identify the men temporarily.
</p>

<p>
A charter for the local was given from national headquarters, and the new
cards were issued, designating them simply as members of Local No. â€”â€”. The
membership of this local, exclusively Negro, grew from twenty to seventy-five
in two months. One of the Negro officials of the local stated that its members
had been working in all parts of the Chicago District, including the North
Side and Evanston, and that they had a representative on the District Council.
The attitude of the white workers, he stated, was a little cool on the first day,
but there is now no evidence of friction. He thought that the members of
this local were well pleased and happy.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Negro Musicians</i> are organized into a strong separate local, chartered
in 1902. It has a membership of approximately 325. It has held the Municipal
Pier dance-hall contract for three years, and besides many other contracts
in the city. It furnishes players for various occasions for a considerable
territory outside of Chicago. This group much prefers its own union, but works
jointly with the large white union, the Chicago Federation of Musicians,
whenever matters come up affecting both organizations. Both unions have
the same wage scale.
</p>

<p>
Where Negro workers are permitted to join white locals but prefer to have
their own colored local there is no feeling that they are discriminated against,
occasional joint meetings with white locals being characterized by friendly
interest and good fellowship. Where, however, a union closes the door of its
white locals to Negroes and organizes them into separate locals because the
white members object to contact with Negroes, a very difficult situation exists.
This condition is illustrated by the methods of the Waiters' Union in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Negro waiters are not admitted into the white Waiters' Union, but are
placed in the Pullman Porters and Dining-Car Waiters' Union, which is a local
affiliated with the same international as the white Waiters' Union. The makeshift
of putting Negro waiters, although employed in city hotels, restaurants,
and cafÃ©s, into this local is pointed to by Negroes as unmistakable evidence of
discrimination.
</p>

<p>
The culinary strike in Chicago, which started May 1, 1920, resulted in
failure for the unions concerned largely because Negroes acted as strike
breakers. This is easily accounted for by the fact that seventeen years ago
Negro waiters lost their positions in many of the first-class hotels and restaurants
in the business district through circumstances in which they felt that they
had been "double-crossed" by the unions, of which they then were members.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_419' name='Page_419' href='#Page_419'>419</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Negro strike breakers in 1920, however, found themselves again displaced,
this time through the action of employers. A typical instance was
found in the restaurant of a hotel patronized largely by people of German
descent, the managers as well as many of the former waiters being of German
extraction. These waiters, some of whom had been employed for many years
in this restaurant, were members of the union and went out when the strike
was called. The managers replaced them with Negroes. The latter filled
the positions with apparent satisfaction for nearly a year, when suddenly they
were all discharged and the old waiters taken back.
</p>

<p>
A regular patron of the restaurant, a man of German descent, expressed
vigorous views upon the "injustice" with which the Negroes had been treated
by the management, which should have appreciated their service through the
period when the former waiters caused trouble. He said he had always found
the Negroes efficient and willing, and many of them "very intelligent fellows."
Although of the same nationality as the managers and the former waiters, many
of whom he had known for years, he did not let this national feeling blind him
to what he considered most unfair treatment of the Negroes. He said that
he had discussed the matter with one of the managers and had been told that
the reason why the Negroes had been discharged and the old waiters taken
back was because of complaints against the Negroes by patrons of the restaurant.
He added, "I think that's bunk."
</p>

<p>
A change in the officers of the Waiters' Union at the recent election has
placed in power a group which recognizes that the entire policy of the culinary
unions must be co-ordinated and proper provision made for the large Negro
element in the field. If this is not done, it is felt that a rival Negro union may
be organized, similar to that organized by the Negro railway workers. In
fact, even now a beginning has been made toward such an organization by a
few high-grade Negro waiters who have been in active charge of the waiters
of several of the large hotel dining-rooms during the recent strike.
</p>

<h6>
C. UNIONS ADMITTING NEGROES TO SUBORDINATE OR AUXILIARY LOCALS
</h6>

<p>
The practice of admitting Negroes to subordinate locals appears to be very
unusual in Chicago. The investigation disclosed only one instance where
the policy of the union was to admit Negroes only to subordinate locals. The
Commission is not at liberty to publish the name of this union, which makes
the following provision for Negro locals in its constitution:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Where there are a sufficient number of colored helpers they may be organized
as an auxiliary local and shall be under the jurisdiction of the white local union having
jurisdiction over that locality; and minutes of said auxiliary local must be submitted
to duly authorized officers of said white local for their approval.
</p>

<p>
In shops where there is a grievance committee of the white local, grievances of
members of said auxiliary local will be handled by that committee.
</p>

<p>
Members of auxiliary locals composed of colored helpers shall not transfer except
to another auxiliary local composed of colored members, and colored helpers will not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_420' name='Page_420' href='#Page_420'>420</a></span>
be promoted to ... or helper apprentice; and will not be admitted to shops
where white helpers are now employed.
</p>

<p>
Auxiliary locals will be represented in all conventions by the delegates elected
from the white local in that locality.

</p>
</div>

<p>
The officials of this union stoutly maintain that the provisions above
quoted are not discriminatory, and they are at a loss to explain why attempts
to organize Negro workers in Chicago into auxiliary locals have not met with
success.
</p>

<h6>
D. UNIONS EXCLUDING NEGROES FROM MEMBERSHIP
</h6>

<p>
Chicago locals which exclude the Negro do so either in conformity with the
laws of their national unions or in the exercise of "local option." Locals
belonging to the national and international unions which bar the Negro by
written provision in their constitutions or rituals are obliged to follow the same
racial policy as their parent bodies. This number includes the Chicago locals
belonging to the eight American Federation of Labor national unions which
exclude the Negro, and the locals of the four railway brotherhoods which likewise
exclude the Negro by constitutional provision.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the locals which are bound to follow the policy of their
nationals, there are certain other locals which are known to reject Negro
applicants. By allowing their locals to practice "local option" or to require a
majority or two-thirds vote for election to membership, the progressive policy
of certain American Federation of Labor national and international unions
which admit the Negro is nullified.
</p>

<p>
The Machinists' Union has frequently been referred to as a union which,
although complying in its constitution with the American Federation of Labor
policy of no racial discrimination, still effectually bars the Negro by a provision
in its secret ritual. In effect, however, there is no real difference between such
a policy on the part of the Machinists' Union and that of the unions which
apparently practice exclusion as an unwritten law. With the Machinists'
Union must then be grouped such unions as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal
Workers' International Alliance, International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers of America, and United Association of Plumbers and Steam Fitters
of United States and Canada. The Electricians' Union has only one Negro
member out of a total membership of 11,000 in Chicago.
</p>

<h4>
V. ATTITUDE OF NEGROES TOWARD UNION ORGANIZATION
</h4>

<p>
From its attitude toward labor unions the Negro population of Chicago
may be considered in four groups: (1) racial leaders outside the labor movementâ€”ministers,
editors, politicians, etc.; (2) Negroes with a special interest
in opposing unions; (3) Negro workers outside of the unions; (4) Negro
workers within the ranks of the unions.
</p>

<h5>
1. RACIAL LEADERS OUTSIDE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT
</h5>

<p>
Within this group are found many sincere workers for the welfare of the
race. Their attitude is determined by the apparent practicability of courses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_421' name='Page_421' href='#Page_421'>421</a></span>
of action for Negroes in relation to the unions. These attitudes again depend
upon their familiarity with the principles and purposes of unionism. They
recognize that the entrance of large numbers of Negroes in industry has been
recent. The belief is that the employers rather than the labor unions provided
this first opportunity, and since, under most frequent circumstances, the
holding of these positions has been due to the kindly attitude of employers,
they felt that first loyalty was due to them.
</p>

<p>
They have also been affected by experiences with labor unions which in
the past have not been disposed to accept Negroes freely into membership
with them.
</p>

<p>
Although the interest of employers in securing Negroes has not always been
merely the granting of an opportunity for work, where Negroes have entered
as strike breakers they have usually remained. This recent entrance into
industry has made them, for the first time, a considerable factor, and they
feel that the unions, recognizing their importance to the accomplishment of
union aims, are making appeals to them for membership, not out of a spirit
of brotherhood, but merely to advance their purposes.
</p>

<p>
These considerations have largely determined the attitude of many Negro
leaders, especially the ministers, some of whom have been requested by
employers to recommend members of their congregations for jobs in various
fields of industry. At a recent industrial convention of Negro organizations
controlling the employment of thousands of Negro workers, it was decided that
Negroes would not be sent as strike breakers to plants where the strikers'
unions accepted Negroes, and that they would advise Negroes to join the
unions wherever possible, but that where Negroes are offered positions by
employers in trades where Negroes are excluded from the unions, they would
not be advised to forego the opportunity.
</p>

<p>
An intelligent Negro woman, who has been active in trying to acquaint
ministers with union aims and methods, commented upon the fact that until
recently Negro ministers knew very little about unionism, except that employers
were opposed to it. This was enough to influence many ministers to urge
Negro workers to stay out of labor unions and thus demonstrate their loyalty
to employers who had given them a chance in industry.
</p>

<p>
A prominent Negro leader, a member of the Illinois legislature, stated his
position respecting unions, at one of the industrial conferences held by the
Commission, as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

I want to confess that I have never felt that I could intelligently advise the colored
people who ask me whether laboring people should join the unions. It has been the
opinion of the leaders of our race for years that employers of labor felt more kindly
toward colored labor and were less concerned about the color of the workmenâ€”were
only concerned about the character of the service. We felt as leaders of the race
that the labor employer was given a square deal much more than the employee himself....
We had a strike here of waiters several years ago when the Kohlsaat
lunchroom waiters were involved. I was the president of a men's Sunday club, and
some labor agitators got the colored boys to join the white Waiters' Union, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_422' name='Page_422' href='#Page_422'>422</a></span>
remember when the matter came before the club I told them, "They raised your
wages to the white man's scale, and the white men are raising you out in the street,"
and that is what they did too.... I have been somewhat influenced by that
experience.

</p>
</div>

<h5>
2. NEGROES WITH A SPECIAL INTEREST IN OPPOSING UNIONS
</h5>

<p>
The rift between employers and labor unions has provided a field of
exploitation for certain less responsible Negroes. Their operations have
occasioned bitter feeling between Negroes and labor unions and have accomplished
little or nothing for the Negro workers. A Negro editor of a small and
irresponsible paper advises Negro workers not to join the white man's union,
but instead to join a union which he has formed and of which he is president.
He is looked upon with suspicion by representative Negroes of Chicago, who
believe that he is willing to sacrifice the best interests of the race to serve his
own purposes. A well-informed Negro outlined the method employed by
the editor in question to represent himself to employers of labor as one who
controls large numbers of Negro laborers. In furtherance of this plan, which
appears to have prospered, he organized a group which he called the "American
Unity Labor Union." The appeal on the one hand to Negroes was that white
unions would not admit them on an equal basis and that white employers preferred
Negro non-unionists to white unionists and would pay them the same
wages while according them better treatment. To white employers he represented
the Negroes as being opposed to unions because they were white
men's unions, and as such discriminated against Negroes, and that they
belonged in large numbers to his organization, which was designed to improve
the quality of Negro labor by increasing Negro pride in special and unmixed
endeavors.
</p>

<p>
That certain employers did give money for this kind of service is apparent
in several instances. A Negro ex-clergyman secured for a long period something
like $2.00 per capita for every Negro supplied by him to any one of ten
iron foundries in the Calumet district.
</p>

<p>
The following are typical of advertisements which appear regularly in the
paper of the Negro editor referred to above:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center p2">
<span class="smcap">Wanted</span>

<span class="smcap">Get a Square Deal with Your Own Race</span>

<p>
Time has come for Negroes to do now or never. Get together and stick together
is the call of the Negro. Like all other races, make your own way; other races have
made their unions for themselves. They are not going to give it to you just because
you join his union. Make a union of your own race; union is strength. Join the
American Unity Packers Union of the Stock Yards, this will give you a card to work

<p>
During the latter part of December, 1920, the editor in question visited
the large daily newspapers in Chicago and presented an article which purported
to tell of a large mass meeting of his union at which this group decided that
they would work at the Stock Yards, steel mills, and all other plants in Chicago
and the Calumet region and at all foundries and factories at a 15 per cent
discount on wages previously paid for skilled labor, and 10 per cent on common-labor
wages. Although only one paper gave any attention to this statement,
the opinion of some of the more responsible Negroes was expressed in a Negro
newspaper in Chicago, which characterized the man as "a public nuisance"
and his story as "bunk."
</p>

<h5>
3. NEGRO WORKERS OUTSIDE OF UNIONS
</h5>

<p>
Negro workers outside of the union ranks often do not see any necessity for
unionism or do not understand its aims and methods; many are frankly suspicious
of the good intentions of white unionists toward Negroes; others
condemn unions generally because of some bitter experience with a particular
union, while still others are enthusiastic believers in unionism and expect to
join a union at some time. Several shades of opinion are illustrated by the
following quotations taken at random from interviews with a large number of
Negro workers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_424' name='Page_424' href='#Page_424'>424</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Hâ€”â€” Gâ€”â€”, thirty-four years old, left a farm in Georgia to come to Chicago in
October, 1919. Employed as a laborer in a paper-box manufacturing plant. He
said he didn't know much about unions but couldn't see what good they were doing.
They made prices go up, but wages didn't go up with prices. If unions did any good
he would join, but he can't see that they do.
</p>

<p>
Wâ€”â€” Wâ€”â€” had spent nearly all of his life hauling logs to be made into ties for
railroads. When he came here from the South he worked as a trucker in the Quartermaster's
Department of the army until the department closed. After loafing half a
month, he got his present job trucking at a box factory. Unions would be all right,
in his opinion, if they let all of the men in who would do right, but when they don't,
they do more harm than good. He used to belong to the Butchers' Union at the
Stock Yards and "got along fine," but he quit butchering. He intends to get back
in a union if possible. Strikes are too hard on the man that "ain't in the union;
strike out here recently and now we can't make overtime and we hardly make enough
in regular time to live on. Unions are secretâ€”I can't remember all the bunk about
them now, but you pay dues and go to meetings, something like a lodge I guess. If
anything goes wrong on your job you tell it in meeting, and your branch of the union
takes it up with the people. You don't have any of that worry on yourself. They
are all right if you are on the inside, but mighty hard if you ain't."
</p>

<p>
Jâ€”â€” McNâ€”â€”, forty-two years old, had been a farmer in the South all of his life
until he came to Chicago in January, 1920, and went to work in the Yards as a meat
trimmer. He has been asked to join the unions but hasn't done it as yetâ€”he isn't
quite sure they mean a square deal by the colored man, although he can't see why they
would ask him to join if they didn't. Don't know much about the "workings of 'em"
but they pull together, sort of "lodge like." He thinks everybody who belongs is
mighty "close mouthed" about what they do at the meetings. He knows that they
pay dues and have assessments, that they look after sick members and have some sort
of initiation.
</p>

<p>
Jâ€”â€” Lâ€”â€”, fifty-two years old, is foreman over the truckers in a box factory. He
said: "Unions ain't no good for a colored man, I've seen too much of what they don't
do for him. I wouldn't join for nothingâ€”wanted me to join one at the Yards but
I wouldn't; no protection; if they had been, the colored men who belonged might
have worked while the riot was going on; only thing allowed out there then was
foreigners. If a thing can't help you when you need help, why have it? That's
the way I feel about unions. I tell you they don't mean nothing for me."
</p>

<p>
Hâ€”â€” Sâ€”â€”, twenty-four years old, had lived in Chicago only two months. He
said: "Well I don't know, you see these other folks been here longer than me; they
ain't joined, and I reckon they know more about it than me. No, they didn't have
no unions where I comed fromâ€”ain't nothing there anyway but farmers. I reckon,
though, if I had a chance I might join. They can't do much harm here to a fellow."
</p>

<p>
Jâ€”â€” Hâ€”â€”, thirty-eight years old, came up from Alabama in 1916 with about thirty
other men during the big rush from the South. They went to work almost immediately
at the Stock Yards, where he worked as a laborer, stripping bacon. After he
quit this he was out of work for nearly a month. He heard about the wool mills.
They put him on the very first day and he has been there ever since.
</p>

<p>
He does not belong to a union. He "would join one if I had a chance and it
meant anything to me materially." He does not understand them, "can't understand
why they strike and keep men out of work."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_425' name='Page_425' href='#Page_425'>425</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Mâ€”â€” Lâ€”â€”, forty-two years old, came to Chicago from Tennessee in 1894. He
said: "I tried every job under the sun since I came. My first job was porter in the
Palmer House; made good tips here but not very much salary. Changed to bellboy;
was finally made head bellboy; stayed there four years; boss made me mad and I
quit. Along about this time I met my wife. I wanted to make her think I was a
regular man, so got a job as a laborer in a foundry. Since then I've gone from one
foundry to the other. Work got so hard I quit one time; went on the road; stayed
there for about four years, then went back to the foundry work; worked for Illinois
Malleable for three years first time; had trouble with straw boss; he fired me; went
to McCormick's but they didn't pay so well, so I got back on my old job. Yes,
unions are the best thing in the world for a working man. If I'd been in a union
my boss couldn't have fired me that time. I wish it was so you could join a union
regardless of your color. We need protection on our jobs as well as the white man.
I guess though that time is coming. I don't know much about the workings of a
union, but I do know it's a protection to the man who belongs."
</p>

<p>
Fâ€”â€” Dâ€”â€”, twenty-eight years old, does not belong to a union because there are no
unions in the car shops where he works. He says unions are the best things in the
world if the right kind of people are at the head, and if all the fellows will join, but
when half of them won't join, unionism won't do because it just means loss of your job.
</p>

<p>
Râ€”â€” Râ€”â€”, thirty-four years old, has been working in Chicago three months at his
regular trade as a stove joiner. He learned to join stoves at a mill in Helena. He has
never had a chance to join a union, but all the white men in the mill at Helena belonged,
and they fared lots better than the Negro men. He wants to join one here the very
first chance he gets. He is a skilled laborer, knows he can put out as much work as
any man doing his line of work, feels he should be paid as much as anyone else, and
knows the only way this can happen to him is to get in a union where he has some
protection and backers. There is a union where he is, but he hasn't been asked to
join it yet. He says he has found out that the colored man, if he wants the same
thing as a white man gets, has to get in things with them.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Nâ€”â€” Mâ€”â€” found work as a maid in a Chicago hospital after she was deserted
by her husband. She wants to save money enough to run her while she takes "nurse
training." She did not know anything about unions until she went to the hospital.
The nurses there had a union, and she saw just how much they can mean to people.
"They usually make the employers do the right thing by the people; unless the nurses
asked too much they got what they wanted." That was what made her decide she
wanted to be a nurse; she saw how square they were with each other, and how the
union made them pull together regardless of whether or not they liked each other.
That is what she liked about the unions: "They make you treat the other fellow
right regardless how you feel toward him."
</p>

<p>
Nellie Wâ€”â€”, age thirty, doing clerical work in a large mail-order establishment,
said that "unions don't mean anything to colored people. The only reason they let
them in when they do is so they can't become strike breakers." She didn't know how
her husband felt about unions, as they had never talked about the matter, but she
knew that she wouldn't join one.
</p>

<p>
Oâ€”â€” Lâ€”â€”, thirty-eight years old, had migrated from Georgia in the summer of
1917. To him unions are "the best thing that ever came the colored man's way.
Out here [in a box factory] it doesn't make quite so much difference whether I'm in
one or not, but if I ever go back to my trade as plasterer, that's the first thing I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_426' name='Page_426' href='#Page_426'>426</a></span>
intend to try and do. You get protection, you get more money, and then too the
white man gets a chance to see that you are not all for yourself, for when you are in
a union you work for everybody's good."
</p>

<p>
Hâ€”â€” has been a head waiter in a hotel. He believes the big reason why Negroes
are not strongly enthusiastic for unions is because they feel they will not get square
treatment. This he based upon continual references to the 1903 waiters' strike.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The attitude of indifference or suspicion so frequently encountered among
Negro workers outside of the unions is attributed by white and Negro labor
leaders and union men to the following reasons: (<i>a</i>) traditional treatment of
Negroes by white men; (<i>b</i>) influence of racial leaders who oppose unionism;
and (<i>c</i>) influence of employers' propaganda against unionism.
</p>

<p>
The traditional treatment of Negroes in the South, increasingly reflected
in the North, has made the Negro suspicious of the white man's sincerity.
Negroes, therefore, naturally feel that they will not get a "square deal" in
white unions. In support of this attitude the waiters' strike of 1903 is still
cited as an instance of "double-crossing" by white unions.
</p>

<p>
This strike was so often referred to by Negroes as a justification for their
attitude toward labor-union policies that it seemed worth while to attempt to
learn the facts, even though seventeen years had elapsed since the strike
occurred.
</p>

<p>
Two organizers for the American Federation of Labor, a newspaper editor,
an officer of the Negro local during the strike, the head waiter of one of the
large hotels (all Negroes), and John Fitzpatrick, president of the Chicago
Federation of Labor, were asked to tell the facts.
</p>

<p>
Reports are conflicting in many instances. However, the explanations of
circumstances as presented to the Commission are as follows:
</p>

<p>
The union of cooks and waiters involved in the strike of 1903, affiliated with
the American Federation of Labor, had a membership of 20,000, of whom over
2,000 were Negroes. The Negroes had only recently been taken into the union
as a separate local under their own officers. The strike first centered on
Kohlsaat's chain of restaurants. This lasted seven weeks, during which time
all of the union members were out. The strike terminated in circumstances
on which there is general disagreement. Negroes state that the white unionists
"double-crossed" them, and when Kohlsaat refused to take back the Negro
waiters who had walked out with the whites the latter went back to work and
left the Negroes without jobs. It is known that during the general excitement
the charter of the Negro local was revoked, although no one appears to know
how or by whom this was done. The white union leaders have frequently
attempted to absolve the union of responsibility for this situation and place
the blame on the Kohlsaat restaurants and the <i>Chicago Herald</i>, controlled by
Kohlsaat. John Fitzpatrick, before the Commission, referred to the incident
thus:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Commissioner</i>: Concerning the waiters' strike several years ago, the Kohlsaat
strike, were they unionized under your direction in order to raise the scale of dinner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_427' name='Page_427' href='#Page_427'>427</a></span>
men [they were known as dinner men] to the union scale? What was the success
of it as far as the colored waiters were concerned?
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Fitzpatrick</i>: They weren't organized for financial purposes. They were
organized as workers. We felt they ought to have our co-operation, so we went out
to organize them. The Kohlsaat newspaper was one of the instruments by which
they perpetrated the conspiracy, and some other papers went into a scheme and tried to
bring about an atmosphere of fear and suspicion between the colored and white workers.
</p>

<p>
It was Sunday, and the charter of the colored workers was in my possession. That
night they met, and I was installing officers at Twenty-third Street and Washington
Avenue. That morning the <i>Herald</i> ran a front-page story, first column, teeming with
a set-up against organized labor and warning the colored workers to beware.
</p>

<p>
When I got up on the platform I read the story to them and said, "That sets up
one side of the story, and there is a conspiracy to destroy your rights. What do
you want to do about it?"
</p>

<p>
They said, "We will go ahead. We know what the employers want and you go
ahead and instal us." They went ahead and got into that strike. The employers
said: "We are going to supplant colored men with white union girls." We told them
we wouldn't permit union girls to go on the job. The Kohlsaats begged of us to give
them white union women, and we refused to do so.
</p>

<p>
Now then, while this was going on, the newspapers had different reports out, and
they went out and had the charter of this local revoked. How they did it, I don't
know. But I have my own notions how a newspaper operates. I think that a newspaper
has influence and money and other things, and that is the only way I can account
for that thing happening. They went to the international organization to revoke the
charter of this organization.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This whole situation was obscured by a mass of charges and counter-charges,
but the fact that the strike failed was evident enough. Regardless
of what the facts actually were, there is a widespread belief among Negro
workers that the colored waiters were "double-crossed" by white unions in
this strike. Since it is men's belief about facts which determines behavior, it
is not surprising to find that Negro strike breakers could be found in large
numbers to take the place of waiters who went on strike in May, 1920.
</p>

<p>
The influence of some employers is also a factor in the attitude of Negroes
toward labor unions. In many open shops the employers and unions are
engaged in a continuous struggle. In such cases, if persuasion and argument
fail, there is an effective instrument in strike breakers. For this purpose
Negroes have frequently been used. Instances in Chicago are found in the
strikes in the steel industry, the Stock Yards, and the culinary industry.
Many labor leaders and union members believe that welfare clubs, company
Y.M.C.A.'s, glee clubs, and athletic clubs are encouraged and supported by
employers as a substitute for a form of organization which they cannot control.
The subsidizing of social movements and churches is regarded as one of the
means employed by large employers to insure this reserve of strike breakers.
The union organizer in the steel strike, W. Z. Foster, stated at one of the
conferences held by the Commission that, after an address to the Negro steel
workers at a church in Pittsburgh, the Negro preacher had said to him: "It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_428' name='Page_428' href='#Page_428'>428</a></span>
nearly broke up the congregation, but we decided you were going to speak here
in this church." The organizer continued:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Then I got the underneath of all this thing and found that this church had lost a
donation of $2,500.00 from the Steel Corporation for allowing me to speak. They
had tried to block my speech to these colored workers in Pittsburgh. Whenever it's a
question of a donation to a poor, struggling church like that, we know what usually
happens.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The statement made by George W. Perkins, president of the Cigarmakers'
International Union, was typical of the view of labor leaders:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
If you go to the root, you will find that economic reason; the employers, not all
of them but many of them, in our industry as well as others, will divide the workers if
they can. That is the history all along. They will divide them, not because they
are black and white, but to keep them divided so they won't unite in the organization.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another labor leader, acting as an organizer in large industries in various
cities, stated at another conference:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I want to tell you that a strike breaker is a very precious animal for the employer,
and if he thinks he has a great body of colored workers in this country who are apt
to learn trades with very little practice, as an inexhaustible well of strike breakers, he
is not going to stop at a little thing like propaganda. He will find plenty of excuses
to keep men out of the union. In the Stock Yards, in the steel industry, he will find
arguments and he will carry on propaganda.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The difficulties inherent in the whole question of organizing Negroes were
probably best brought out before the Commission by W. Z. Foster, who took
a leading part in organizing Negroes in the Stock Yards, the most important
industry in Chicago so far as Negroes are concerned:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We found in the steel industry that the colored worker was very unresponsive to
organization. The same was true in the packing industry. Let me give you first
what steps we took in the packing industry in Chicago in 1917, the big campaign which
resulted in the organization of men. The first meeting we had we sat around a table
and talked it over, and we realized that there were two big problems, the organization
of the foreign worker and the organization of the colored worker. We shortly dismissed
the problem of organizing the foreign worker, but we realized that to accomplish
the organization of the colored worker was the real problem. When we went
into the packing-house situation we were determined to organize the colored worker if
it was humanly possible to do so, and I think I can safely say that the men who
carried on that campaign realized fully the necessity for the organization of the colored
worker, not wholly, or at least not only, from the white man's point of view, but from
his own point of view to a certain extent. In other words, we were not altogether
materialistic. We like to think that we were a little bit altruistic in the situation.
There was a total employment of twelve or fourteen thousand. We found that we
had tremendous opposition to encounter.
</p>

<p>
First of all it took this attitude, that the colored man would not be allowed to
join the unions at all. We met that broadcast with such circulars as those already
shown. I wrote some of them up myself as secretary of the council, inviting these
men in such a way that these colored men could not help but realize that there was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_429' name='Page_429' href='#Page_429'>429</a></span>
nothing to this argument that they would not be allowed to join the union.... The
next argument that developed was, "Sure, the white man will take you into his union
because you are in the minority." But we fought all of these arguments, and we
organized a local union on State Street.
</p>

<p>
Then the argument was raised that it was a "Jim Crow" proposition. It was
quite general along State Street that it was a "Jim Crow" proposition. It seemed to
make no difference what move we made, there was always an argument against it,
so we overcame the "Jim Crow" argument by combining the white locals and the
black. We said to the boys: "This is not a colored local. This is a neighborhood
local of miscellaneous locals. Any colored man can belong to this local." We told
the white men: "You are free to come in here and join this union."
</p>

<p>
Well, we punctured that argument that there was discrimination in the Stock
Yards, and I would challenge anyone to show where the unions in the Stock Yards
campaign have discriminated against the colored man. There may have been isolated
cases of an individual here and there, but I will say this, and I was on the organizing
committee and probably in closer touch with the situation than anyone else here in
the city with those four or five thousand colored workers that we organized, I dare
say that 40 per cent of the total amount of grievances that were presented by all the
workers in the Stock Yards came from these colored workers, and the standing instructions
were to look after them very carefully....
</p>

<p>
But the more we tried to help the colored worker the more intense the opposition
was, because there was a force working against us, and we could not help but feel it.
We got it from the colored people themselves, and it is a fact that some of the organizers
were actually afraid to go around to some of these saloons and poolrooms where
they congregated because of the agents of the packers, or whoever was responsible
for that propaganda, and they felt that their lives were in danger.... Out in the
Stock Yards we could not win their support. It could not be done. They were constitutionally
opposed to unions, and all our forces could not break down that opposition.... We
tried to make our appeal quite general in scope. We got the best
organizers. A good colored organizer is very rareâ€”a man who is thoroughly qualified
to represent the trade-union point of view. We tried to find one and picked out a
colored member of the Engineers' Union, a man highly honored in all the trade unions
of Chicago.... The reason the colored man gave for not joining you will find in
the circular "Beware of the White Man's Union," and that the only way that they can
ever make any headway in the industry is to stick in with the boss and then when there
is a strike to step in and take the jobs that are left there....
</p>

<p>
Race prejudice has everything to do with it. It lies at the bottom. The colored
man as a blood race has been oppressed for hundreds of years. The white man has
enslaved him, and they don't feel confidence in the trade unions. But there is more
real fraternal feeling among the black and white workers than in any other grade of
society.... As soon as the colored man becomes a factor in industry, he is going
to be organized, providing he does not become a victim to the line of tactics that are
laid out by the employer. In the steel strike he lined up with the bosses.
</p>
</div>

<h5>
4. NEGRO WORKERS WITHIN THE UNIONS
</h5>

<p>
Negro workers inside the ranks of such unions as the Stock Yards', Janitors',
and Hodcarriers', types of the unions which accept Negroes with complete
equality, feel, with very few exceptions, that they are being given a "square
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_430' name='Page_430' href='#Page_430'>430</a></span>
deal" by the unions. By coming into the unions they say they have been able
to secure better working conditions and higher wages. They express satisfaction
with the treatment accorded them by white unionists on the job and at
meetings, where the grievances of Negro members are given the same attention
as the complaints of white members. The situation in the unions mentioned
has been so fully described already in this report that there is no need for further
details on the friendly relationship which exists between white and colored
members of these unions. Many Negro unionists look to labor organization
as one of the most promising solutions of race problems.
</p>

<h4>
VI. THE NEGRO AND STRIKES
</h4>

<p>
The attitude of Negro workers during strikes is closely connected with
the attitude of Negroes toward union organization. As stated before, there
are many cross-currents at work, some tending to keep Negroes out of unions
and others impelling them toward the unions. All the forces at work to
prejudice the Negro against union organization are factors which help to explain
his willingness to take the place of striking white workers. The loyalty of the
Negro during strikes by white employees was referred to by a number of the
representatives of large employers attending the industrial conferences held
by the Commission.
</p>

<p>
Some of the most conspicuous cases coming to the attention of the Commission
in which Negroes have taken the place of white strikers or have
remained at work during strikes are the following:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Stock Yards strike of 1904 lasted from July 4 to the middle of September.
The general superintendent of one of the plants in the Yards, appearing before the
Commission, said: "The strike was called at 12:00 o'clock. Every employee practically
that we had went out. Within two or three days we had any number of colored
employees return to work.... I'd say Negroes helped us to break the strike by
coming to work. A number of Negroes that we understand belonged to the union did
not remain out more than two or three days. Practically all the Negroes came back
before the strike was called off."
</p>

<p>
The strike in the Corn Products Refining Company plant at Argo, where, in the
summer of 1919, before the strike, 300 Negroes were employed, during the strike 900,
and when it was over about 500.
</p>

<p>
The steel strike of 1919. Representatives of several of the iron and steel plants
stated that Negroes had helped to break this strike. The <i>Inter-Church World Movement
Report on the Steel Strike of 1919</i> (p. 177) lists the "successful use of strike-breakers,
principally Negroes, by the steel companies" as the second cause of the
failure of the steel strike. "'Niggers did it' was a not uncommon remark among
company officials."
</p>

<p>
The waiters' strike in 1920.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Less important cases were the following:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A clothing shop where Negro women broke a strike in 1916 and continued in the
employ thereafter. A wool warehouse and storage company which used Negroes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_431' name='Page_431' href='#Page_431'>431</a></span>
at slightly higher wages to replace striking Polish laborers in 1916, and have since continued
to employ Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The strike of Pullman-car cleaners about 1916. Negroes were used as strike
breakers and have since been employed in large numbers, men cleaning the windows
and outside of cars and Negro women doing most of the inside cleaning.
</p>

<p>
Many other instances where Negroes have been used as strike breakers could be
cited.
</p>
</div>

<p>
During a strike, feeling runs high and the word "strike breaker" or "scab"
carries with it a decided stigma among the strikers. White workers ordinarily
do not try to understand why the Negro acts as he does. They do not reason
that the Negro is often loyal to the employer because he feels that the employer,
sometimes at considerable risk, has opened to him industrial opportunities
which, translated into wages, mean better living conditions for himself and
his family. If the white worker took into account the struggle of the Negro
to gain entrance into the fields outside of personal service, the latter's eagerness
to take advantage of any opening, however created, might be better understood
and regarded with more tolerant spirit.
</p>

<p>
What bearing this use of Negro labor has on the attitude of white workers
toward Negroes depends upon whether the subject is approached from the
point of view of the employer or of the trade unionist. Representatives of
the packing companies emphasized the employers' appreciation of the Negro's
loyalty and discounted the antagonism caused by Negroes serving as strike
breakers, while trade-union leaders and others having the workers' point of
view emphasized the seeds of dissension that were sown by such action and
contended that the good will of the employer gained at such a cost was in
reality a handicap to the Negro. White workers feel that Negroes who serve
as strike breakers are helping to earn for their race the stigma of being a "scab"
race. This is especially serious in the case of Negroes, because color identification
makes it easy to focus hatred for the "scab."
</p>

<p>
Union leaders and social workers who participated in the conferences held
by the Commission condemned the practice of some private employment
agencies in sending Negroes to plants as strike breakers without informing
them that a strike was in progress. Investigations in several states have disclosed
such practices of some private employment agencies, "misrepresentation
of terms and conditions of employment" being the most frequent abuse,
according to the report of the Federal Commission on Industrial Relations:
"Men are not informed about strikes that may be on at places to which they
are sent, nor about other important facts which they ought to know."<a name='FA_77' id='FA_77' href='#FN_77' class='fnanchor'>[77]</a>
</p>

<p>
Private employment agencies following such practices try to do so against
colored as well as white workers, although with probably less success because
of the ability of the Negro to speak English. However, the part played by
private employment agencies in supplying Negro strike breakers in Chicago
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_432' name='Page_432' href='#Page_432'>432</a></span>
appears to be of relatively little importance. Ordinarily agents of employers
find Negro strike breakers directly by going into the Negro residence section
with autos or trucks and recruiting the number of men desired. The industrial
secretary of the Urban League made the following statement regarding Negro
strike breakers:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
According to all information available to the Chicago Urban League, it does not
appear that any of the private employment agencies except the one conducted by R. G.
Parker, editor of the <i>Chicago Advocate</i>, who advertised for cooks and waiters to break
the strike of the Cooks and Waiters' Alliance during the National Republican Convention
in June, 1920, have been instrumental in strike breaking.
</p>

<p>
The method used in the organization of strike breakers among colored people is
not well defined. Generally labor scouts work directly for companies affected by
strikes. These scouts have frequently applied to our office for workers, but we have
refused assistance. The men are usually gathered from the streets, poolrooms, or
wherever they can be found. It is the policy of the Chicago Urban League not to
interfere in strikes unless the striking unions have refused to admit colored workers
to their membership. The League is not opposed to unionism, but is interested
primarily in the welfare of colored workers.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
VII. ATTITUDE AND OPINIONS OF LABOR LEADERS
</h4>

<p>
From the eleven representative labor leaders attending the trade-union
conferences held by the Commission, from the various interviews by the
investigators with these and other union officials and members, and from letters
received from labor officials from various parts of the United States, it was
apparent that there were certain definite views held by most of these leaders
as to the relationship of organized labor to the Negro. These views are summarized
and set forth in the following pages:
</p>

<h5>
1. GENERAL PUBLIC HAS RACE PREJUDICE
</h5>

<p>
Race prejudice exists generally in all groups of the white race and only
changes slowly. The worker is just as much subject to it in the beginning as
are the members of all other groups.
</p>

<h5>
2. UNIONS FAIRER TO NEGRO THAN ARE OTHER GROUPS
</h5>

<p>
The unions have given the Negro a fairer deal than other social institutions
or groups, such as department stores, clubs, churches, theaters, fraternal organizations,
hotels, and railways.
</p>

<h5>
3. UNIONS BLAMED FOR CONDITIONS THEY CANNOT CONTROL
</h5>

<p>
Unions are many times blamed for situations in which Negroes are not
admitted to an occupation or industry over which the unions have no control,
the exclusion existing because the attitude of either the public or the employer
prevents the entrance of Negroes into the industry. For example, Negroes
are not employed in Chicago as motormen or conductors on surface or elevated
transportation lines, as telephone operators by the telephone company, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_433' name='Page_433' href='#Page_433'>433</a></span>
sales clerks in department stores, as chauffeurs by taxicab companies, nor as
upholsterers and drapers by firms sending such employees to work in private
homes.
</p>

<p>
The position taken by the unions is that they cannot organize a miscellaneous
public, but that they can only organize those that have the jobs, that as long
as street and elevated lines do not employ Negroes as motormen and conductors
the unions cannot take them in. True, there might be objection on the part
of the members in these unions, but the question has never come up. Also
the traction companies are not in business to reform public opinion and so,
because the public might object, do not engage Negroes in these jobs. In this
their position is similar to that of the large taxicab companies, which, however,
employ non-union workers. They have Negroes in the garages but not as
chauffeurs, probably because they believe that the general public would object
if Negroes were employed as chauffeurs. In such cases the unions feel that
they are not responsible, any more than they are accountable for the policy
of the telephone company which engages no Negro operators. Among other
large businesses must be listed the department stores, which have no Negroes
as sales clerks.
</p>

<p>
Exclusion of Negroes from a trade or industry results in inability to join
the unions in such trades. This fact is well illustrated by the Upholsterers'
Union, which has three branchesâ€”furniture upholsterers, drapers, and mattress
makers. Upholsterers and drapers are frequently sent out by the large stores
to residences of customers, and the stores will not risk offending customers by
sending a Negro into their homes. Consequently there are no Negroes in
these branches of the union. The mattress makers' local, on the other hand,
has more Negro than white members, and the secretary of the union is a
Negro. This situation would not be possible if Negroes were excluded from
employment in mattress factories. In view of the fact that the Upholsterers'
Union freely admits Negroes into the mattress makers' local, Negroes
would also, no doubt, be admitted into the locals of the upholsterers and the
drapers if employers hired Negroes for such work.
</p>

<h5>
4. EXCLUSION POLICY CONDEMNED
</h5>

<p>
The policy, wherever it exists, of excluding Negroes from unions, whether
by direct or indirect means, is considered wrong and shortsighted by the great
majority of labor leaders. They believe that the small group of "aristocratic
and conservative" unions cannot long withstand the American Federation of
Labor policy of organizing Negroes in local and federal unions, nor the policy
of the more progressive national and international unions. As the number of
Negroes increases in the unions now admitting them, as the number of Negro
delegates to city centrals, like the Chicago Federation of Labor, increases,
and as the number of delegates to conventions of the State Federation of Labor
and to the American Federation of Labor increases each year, more and more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_434' name='Page_434' href='#Page_434'>434</a></span>
pressure is being brought to bear on these unions from without and also by
the progressive leaders from within, so that gradually all barriers will be swept
aside. That a gradual change is taking place in the policy of many unions is
evidenced by the following instances:
</p>

<p>
<i>International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers.</i>â€”"In 1902 a local union of
Negro stationary firemen in Chicago could not be chartered because the white
local union would not give its consent."<a name='FA_78' id='FA_78' href='#FN_78' class='fnanchor'>[78]</a> In 1920 the president of Local 7,
Chicago, reported as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The symbol of our organization is, "We shall not discriminate against creed, color
or nationality." The membership of our organization is open to the Negro as much
as to any other man who earns his living by the sweat of his brow. I should say,
offhand, that we have approximately about 100 Negroes who are members of our
Chicago local and who take an active part in all of our deliberations. So far as has
come under my observation the feeling towards these men has always been of the
most cordial nature.
</p>

<p>
I am, however, free to say that we have found that a great many of the employers,
who do not desire to play fair, use the Negro to offset any high standard of wages
which the organization may deem proper and just, and I have found, in my experience,
an endeavor on the part of some of the employers to only use the Negro when he would
want to maintain a lower standard of wages, but when compelled by force of
circumstances to pay a living rate of wages, immediately a request would be made
on the organization that the Negro be removed and a white man furnished. This we
emphatically refuse to do. If the Negro was efficient and competent to perform his
duties prior to the establishment of a living wage he certainly should be competent
enough to perform the same duties afterwards.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Metal Polishers' International Union.</i>â€”The general secretary informed the
Commission:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
At the last international convention held, the question of Negroes entering our
trade was taken up, and the delegates anticipated that, at some future time, Negroes
would be employed, and we felt that, if the manufacturers were left under the impression
that we would refuse to accept them into the organization, it would be an incentive
to the Manufacturers' Association to import Negroes or hire them, so a resolution was
passed that any skilled polisher, buffer, or plater, even though a Negro, should be
admitted to our organization.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>International Association of Machinists.</i>â€”Although at its convention at
Rochester, New York, in 1920, this union again voted down the proposition to
strike out the word "white" from its ritual, there was significance in the fact
that seven resolutions were introduced at the convention to remove the excluding
provision. These resolutions came from unions in the following cities:
two from different locals in Chicago; one from Columbia, South Carolina;
one from Akron, Ohio; one from New Haven, Connecticut; one from Tucson,
Arizona. Resolutions opposing came from Bakersfield, California; Pine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_435' name='Page_435' href='#Page_435'>435</a></span>
Bluff, Arkansas; Whistler, Alabama; and Savannah, Georgia. As an instance
of enthusiastic appreciation of the mutual advantage to whites and Negroes of
joint effort in union organization with no discrimination the following comment
from an office of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees' National Alliance was
received by the Commission:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have one local union composed of white and colored workersâ€”that union
is located in the city of Boston, Massachusetts; roughly speaking, there are approximately
400 in a total membership of about 2,000; at our convention held at Providence,
Rhode Island, last August, one of the delegates from that union was a colored
man. Six years ago Boston colored waiters woke up, and so did the whites, to the
fact that for decades they had been used one against the other by their employers;
they got together, and they affirm with considerable emphasis that amalgamation has
proved beneficial.
</p>
</div>

<h5>
5. UNIONS INSTRUMENTAL IN REMOVING RACE PREJUDICE
</h5>

<p>
Labor leaders emphasize the influence of contact in union meetings in
promoting a friendly understanding between white and colored members.
They point out the fact that the Negro ceases to be a stranger or an object of
prejudice when once he has identified himself with the union. A common
interest in common problems binds the members together, and a spirit of loyalty
to the union develops in the effort to realize the aims of the group. White
members come to have a more kindly feeling for a Negro within the union
group than they have toward a white man who remains outside the union
ranks. Said one union leader:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Some day the white worker is going to coax the black man to line up with him;
all that he needs is a crusader's heart and a genuine desire to make the black man and
himself free, and when he succeeds there won't be, in the economic field at least, the
differences which now exist, due to this pitting of one race against the other and both
being walloped by the action.

<h2>
CHAPTER IX
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">PUBLIC OPINION IN RACE RELATIONS</span>
</h2>

<p>
The Negro in the United States: "A person of African blood (much or little)
about whom men of English descent tell only half the truth, and because of whom they
do not act with frankness and sanity either toward the Negro or to one anotherâ€”in
a word, about whom they easily lose their common sense, their usual good judgment,
and even their powers of accurate observation. The Negro-in-America, therefore,
is a form of insanity that overtakes white men."â€”<i>The Southerner</i> by Walter
Hines Page.
</p>

<p>
The Stoic proverb, that "men are tormented by the opinions they have of
things rather than by the things themselves,"<a name='FA_79' id='FA_79' href='#FN_79' class='fnanchor'>[79]</a> applies as aptly to the relations
between the white and Negro populations as to other of our problems. Because
the "race problem" has been so vaguely stated, so variously explained, and so
little understood, discussions of it and the conduct of whites and Negroes
toward each other usually express feeling rather than intelligence.
</p>

<p>
The public is guided by patterns of behavior and traditions generally
accepted, whether sound or unsound. False notions, if believed, may control
conduct as effectively as true ones. And pre-established notions lose their
subtle influence when it appears that their basis is in error.
</p>

<p>
White persons are generally uninformed on matters affecting Negroes and
race relations. They are forced to rely on partial and frequently inaccurate
information and upon traditional sentiments. This same ignorance applies
to Negroes, though not to the same degree; for they know white people in
their intimate personal and home relations and in connection with their work
in factories and stores. They read their books and papers and often hear their
discussions. Negroes are perhaps more race conscious than whites because
every day they must face situations which remind them of their race. They
are sensitive to moods and antagonisms expressed in words and shown in
manners. Their impressions from the white group are subject to distortion
as are those received by the whites from them. Negroes manifest characteristics
which, though the natural result of their circumstances and experiences,
are yet misunderstood and often resented by the white group. For Negroes
live and think in a state of isolation which is almost complete; and no white
group understands it, or can fully understand it.
</p>

<p>
The riot of 1919 is an example of the effects of this isolation and misunderstanding.
The accumulated resentments, unchallenged mutual beliefs and
resultant friction, culminated in a surprising calamity and wholesale bloodshed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_437' name='Page_437' href='#Page_437'>437</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This chapter, therefore, has a thesis and a purpose. If these beliefs, prejudices
and faulty deductions can be made accessible for examination and
analysis, many of them will be corrected. If a self-critical attitude toward
these prejudices can be stimulated by typical examples, a considerable step
will have been taken toward understanding and harmony.
</p>

<p>
The study of public opinion in race relations attempted by the Commission
does not presume to set down definite laws of its working, or to tell all about
how it works. The aim is merely to make apparent and objective its place
and importance in race relations, to indicate some of the ways in which it has
developed; how it expresses itself, how it affects both the white and Negro
groups; how, in its present state, it is strengthened, weakened, polluted, or
purified by deliberate agencies or even by its own action, and finally how it may
be used to reduce, if not to prevent, racial unfriendliness and misunderstanding.
</p>

<p>
The following plan is employed in presenting this branch of the subject:
</p>

<p>
1. Beliefs regarding Negroes, which greatly influence the conduct of white
persons toward them, are described as they apply in the local environment,
and their origin and background are traced suggestively to their responsible
literature and circumstances.
</p>

<p>
2. Types of sentiment which are variants of these basic beliefs are presented
with a view to making them intelligible, and to classifying them according to
resolvable factors of misunderstanding.
</p>

<p>
3. Since personal attitudes and beliefs are molded by traditions and heritages
apart from the exclusive influence of literature, material collected through
intimate inquiry is presented objectively to describe the processes by which
they appear to be created and to grow. Replies to a searching questionnaire
on attitudes and opinions express the result of painstaking self-analysis.
</p>

<p>
4. Negro opinion on these same issues is described and illustrated with a
view to making it intelligible. Their views are listed and their interpretations
of current white sentiment are explained as far as possible.
</p>

<p>
5. From the subjective aspect the study then turns to the instruments by
which these opinions are formed and perpetuated and the individual attitudes
created. The following are deemed the chief agencies: (<i>a</i>) the press, (<i>b</i>)
rumors, (<i>c</i>) myths, (<i>d</i>) propaganda. Conscious and unconscious abuse of these
instruments of opinion-making is pointed out and explained.
</p>

<p>
6. Finally, means are suggested by which public opinion may, where it is
faulty, correct itself, and employ its own instruments in the creation of wholesome
sentiments among Negroes with respect to whites, and among whites with respect
to Negroes.
</p>

<h3>
A. OPINIONS OF WHITES AND NEGROES
</h3>

<h4>
I. BELIEFS CONCERNING NEGROES
</h4>

<p>
Literature concerning Negroes has been written chiefly by southern students
facing the problem in its most intense form and usually meeting the most backward
of Negroes. Negro habits have been objectively explained and standards
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_438' name='Page_438' href='#Page_438'>438</a></span>
of judgment upon the entire group have usually been deduced therefrom. This
constitutes the bulk of serious literature on the subject of the Negro; it is generally
used in research into the problem.
</p>

<p>
In the North as in the South the assumptions regarding the Negro have
their basis in similar sources. The beliefs, in general, are the same, though
held by individuals in varying degrees. Though northerners do not believe so
firmly and with such emotional intensity all that southerners believe about
Negroes, yet they share these beliefs in proportion as they have been influenced
or informed by southerners. It may happen, for example, that in a small
northern town with but a handful of Negroes there is no discernible distinction
in the treatment accorded them. The growth of the colony, however, can
bring to the surface at first almost undiscernible shades of the usual beliefs,
and finally the identical beliefs entertained by other communities.
</p>

<p>
There is, for example, no section of the country in which it is not generally
believed by whites that Negroes are instinctively criminal in inclination. Some
believe that they are criminal by nature and explain it as a result of heredity;
some feel that it is a combination of heredity and environment; while others
may feel that this inclination is due to environment alone. How, indeed, may
the belief be avoided? Crime figures on Negroes are consistently unfavorable
to any other conclusion. Students have gone so far as to accept without question
these figures and proceed to explain that criminal tendency scientifically.
This is also true as to low mentality, sexual immorality, and a long list of
other supposed racial defects.
</p>

<p>
Below are presented some of the more important beliefs among whites
about Negroes that have become crystallized by years of unchallenged assumption.
They divide themselves into two general classes: (1) Primary beliefs,
or fundamental and firmly established convictions which have, all around, the
deepest effect on the attitude of whites toward Negroes. These are usually
presented as revealed by statistics, authorities, and research. (2) Secondary
beliefs, or the lighter modifications and variants of the supposed attributes of
Negroes included in the more important assumptions.
</p>

<h5>
1. PRIMARY BELIEFS
</h5>

<p>
<i>Mentality.</i>â€”The chief of these is that the mind of the Negro is distinctly
and distinctively inferior to that of the white race, and so are all resulting
functionings of his mind.
</p>

<p>
This view is held by some to be due to a difference in species, by others to
more recent emergence from primitive life, and by others to be due to backwardness
in ascending the scale of civilization. For this reason it is variously
assumed as a corollary that the mind of the Negro cannot be improved above a
given level or beyond a given age; that his education should be adapted to his
capacities, that is, he should mainly be taught to use his hands. Thus a teacher
in one of the elementary schools of Chicago finds that "colored children are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_439' name='Page_439' href='#Page_439'>439</a></span>
restive and incapable of abstract thought; they must be constantly fed with
novel interests and given things to do with their hands." Accordingly they
are given handicraft instead of arithmetic, and singing instead of grammar.
</p>

<p>
In seeking the opinion of white trades unionists on the admission of Negroes
to unions in Chicago, the Commission encountered in perhaps the harshest
form the conviction that Negroes were inherently unable to perform tasks that
white men did as a matter of course. A member of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers felt that no Negro had, or could ever acquire, intelligence enough
to run an engine. Employers frequently expressed the belief that Negroes
are incapable of performing tasks which require sustained mental application.
This view of their mental weakness appeared in the following statement made
before the Commission by a school principal concerning her experience with
Negro children:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
So far as books are concerned there are set types of learning which they take
with great difficulty. Last Friday a colored boy came to me and said, "I want to go
back to the first grade." We have gotten him in the third grade. He came to me and
criedâ€”a great big boyâ€”because he said the work was much too hard for him, and he
didn't want to study. His teacher was cross with him and insisted he must get to
work. It is an exception to have a boy so frank. But I don't think the instance is
far from the truth. I have never had a white child complain that he was graded too
high and wanted to be put down. Sometimes when they come in, they say to me:
"I went to school in the South, and I am in high fifth grade." "How long were
you in school in the South?" "Three sessions." Two months, and they are in
high fifth grade! I put them into the first or second grade. Sometimes I can't fit
them into the smaller grades, and sometimes they resent it, but when they get into
the actual school work and find they can't do it, they can't complain. I should
say therefore that there is a certain amount of mental backwardness found in colored
children not found in whites.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A teacher in a Chicago public school said: "I believe like Dr. Bruner [director
of Special School, Board of Education] that when a Negro boy grows a
mustache his brain stops working."
</p>

<p>
A teacher in Moseley School said: "The great physical development of the
colored person takes away from the mental, while with the whites the reverse
is true. There is proof for this in the last chapter of Ecclesiastes."
</p>

<p>
<i>Morality.</i>â€”Another of these primary beliefs is that Negroes are not yet
capable of exercising the social restraints which are common to the more civilized
white persons. Sometimes it is said that they are unmoral rather than
immoral. This view, while charitably explaining supposed innate defects of
character, places them outside the circle of normal members of society. Thus
the assistant principal of a Chicago high school attended by Negroes said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
When it comes to morality, I say colored children are unmoral. They have no
more moral sense than a very young white child. Along sex lines they don't know
that this is wrong and that is wrongâ€”that wrong sense isn't a part of them. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_440' name='Page_440' href='#Page_440'>440</a></span>
course we say they are immoral and a white child doing the same thing under the same
circumstances would be. The colored and white children here don't get mixed up in
immorality; they are too well segregated. Not that we segregate them: the whites
keep away from the colored.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This belief appears in statements that there is no family life among Negroes
and but little respect, even in Chicago, for the ordinary decencies; when serious
students of society speak of the promiscuity of colored women and men in
sexual as well as social relations; and when social institutions assume the impossibility
of locating the real father of children in a Negro family. Much public
emphasis is given to the subject of venereal disease among Negroes, and certain
deductions regarding this incidence of disease have resulted from comparative
statistics.
</p>

<p>
<i>Criminality.</i>â€”The assumption back of most discussions of Negro crime is
that there is a constitutional character weakness in Negroes and a consequent
predisposition to sexual crimes, petty stealing, and crimes of violence. Sexual
crimes are alleged and frequently urged in justification of lynching. Popular
judgment takes stealing lightly, because Negroes evidence a marked immaturity
and childishness in it. It is supposed that they appropriate little things
and do not commit larger thefts. Crimes of violence are thought to be characteristic
of Negroes because crimes involving deliberation and planning require
more brains than Negroes possess.
</p>

<p>
The president of a branch of the Illinois Federation of Women's Clubs thus
explained the decision of that organization not to discuss the Negro question
in its meetings:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Most of the presidents expressed themselves as against discussion of the Negro
question because as women's names come out as being against the Negroes these
women and others of the club would have to live in fear of Negro men. A woman
must be careful not to put herself in a position of causing them to have a grudge against
her, as you know a white woman has to fear a colored man.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A resident in an exclusively white residential district said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Mother, sister, and I lived here alone and we had a car which we kept in a garage
in the back yard. Whenever we came in at night we never used the back door, but
always went around front. Several times in walking up the back steps to the porch
we had been frightened by colored men sitting on the steps or lying on the porch,
and so we couldn't use that way into the house.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another white woman, in the course of a discussion of housing indicated
this fear of Negro men:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
When we came here this was a nice neighborhood. After some years a colored
family moved in, then two or three more, and more and more, until you see what we
have here now. I tell you the white people right on this street have to be afraid for
their lives.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_441' name='Page_441' href='#Page_441'>441</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another, living on Langley Avenue, near Forty-third Street, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I don't hold any conversations with Negroes. It's better to be on the safe side
when you've got grown-up daughters. I worry a good deal about my two daughters
as they go and come from work, but they've never had anything happen.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The principal of a Chicago public school was questioned by a visitor concerning
the attitude of white parents toward the association of their children
with Negro pupils in that school. "The white parents are cautious about stirring
up trouble," he said, "for they know the emotional tendency of the colored
to knife and kill."
</p>

<p>
Petty thefts by Negroes, especially of food, are regarded as annoying evils
most easily dealt with by a sort of half-serious firmness. A white resident of a
district largely inhabited by Negroes said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A white neighbor keeps chickens in her back yard. She gets the burglar alarm from
the hen house sometimes twice in a week, and the running thief is always colored.... The
colored buy whatever they want; they'll spend their last cent and not worry
about the next day. If they want a chicken for dinner and it's $1 a pound, they
buy it or steal it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Physical unattractiveness.</i>â€”Objections to contact are often attributed to
physical laws which, it is said, make the sight or other sensory impression of
the Negro unbearably repulsive. This attitude is found in protests against
indiscriminate seating arrangements in street cars. The word "black" has
long been associated with evil and ugliness, and it is not always a simple task
to disassociate the idea from impressions given by a black man. Not merely
is the color regarded as repulsive, but it is the further belief that Negroes have
a peculiar and disagreeable body odor. A Christian Science practitioner in
Chicago, giving her opinion of Negroes, had an idea that they carried a "musky
odor," and were therefore to be avoided. A student at the University of
Chicago and a resident of Hyde Park, talking with an investigator, said: "It
is conceded that the Negro in Chicago must have some place to live, but to
permit promiscuous distribution through scattered sections of the city would
tend to increase the difficulties rather than mitigate them, partly because a
white man would shrink from having a Negro live near him."
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1919 there appeared in one of the Chicago daily papers a
series of articles on the Negro question. In describing the relations between
Negroes and whites in Chicago, the writer said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A second phase of the situation, and the one that causes more inutile railing than
any other, is the crowding into the street cars of colored people. Well, they must
ride on street cars, if only for the reason that most of them live remote from their
work. Even the North State Street line, that used to be considered the special
conveyance for "the quality," has come to be known as the "African Central." If
you can't stomach it, you'll have to walk. They won't.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Living in neighborhoods infrequently visited by Negroes and where, as a
general rule, their occupancy is effectively discouraged, some white residents
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_442' name='Page_442' href='#Page_442'>442</a></span>
occasionally express objections as based on a "natural physical opposition."
Following is a typical statement:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I came here six years ago and there was a very noisy set of white people living in
the apartment house back of mine. Four years ago the landlord put them all out and
rented to colored families. We were all up in arms then; but say, I never had nicer,
more quiet, and respectable neighbors. Their children all behave well, and we can't
kick. But at the same time, black people aren't what one would pick out to have
aroundâ€”I guess it's just because they are black.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Emotionality.</i>â€”This is commonly regarded as explaining features of conduct
in Negroes, some of which are beautiful in their expression while others
are ugly and dangerous. The supposed Negro gift of song is thus an accepted
attribute of his emotional nature. So with his religious inclination. This
same emotionalism is believed to lead him to drink and is frequently made to
account for "his quick, uncalculated crimes of violence." The natural expression
of Negro religious fervor is supposed to be noisy and frenzied. This view
of the <i>Chicago Tribune's</i> special writer is, roughly speaking, the view of thousands
of Chicagoans:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I passed grand old stone churches, once the pride of rich and powerful white
congregations, whither I used to be sent as a reporter not so many years ago, to
hear some of the premier pulpiteers of this town. They are colored people's churches
now, and beneath the arches, where a sedate gospel once was expounded you hear
today the jubilant yell of the dusky brother who has found grace....
</p>

<p>
The service was, indeed, an incident in a three weeks' series of revival meetings
they have been holding at Olivet. The principal performer was the Rev. S. E. J.
Watson, a revivalist from Topeka, a big manâ€”mulatto, I should say, or perhaps
quadroonâ€”with a powerful voice, a masterly platform style, and enormous ardor.
He spoke fluently, used no notes, and demonstrated a free, wide skill in homely
imagery, which, however, included no slang nor vulgarities, but was racy of the plantation
and the cabin kitchen. His picture of God "opening the front door of this good
old world every morning to let in the sun" was one of the most gorgeous flights in
primitive poetry I ever heard, and his narrative, accompanied by the most vivid
pantomime, of the Roman soldiers lifting up the cross after they had nailed Jesus
to it was hardly less than terrifyingâ€”it certainly was terrificâ€”in its sweep of passion
and its reality of detail.
</p>

<p>
And so he wrought them to a high emotional state. Many were crying. Then
came the direct personal appeal to "the unsaved," the threat of the everlasting fire,
and the "lifting up" again and again of the thought of the all-forgiving, all-saving
Jesus. The soft crying became heavy, convulsive sobbing. One by one the unsaved
who made the surrender to whatever it was that had been holding them back, were
led to the seats near the pulpit. Those who did not surrender promptly were evidently
in terrible stress, or thought they were. They emitted shrieks that, truly, made
my heart stand still, and I would have trembled for the sanity of the poor creatures
except that I observed from the corner of my eye that the "saved" in the assemblage
took the shrieks with perfect equanimity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_443' name='Page_443' href='#Page_443'>443</a></span>
</p></div>

<h5>
2. SECONDARY BELIEFS
</h5>

<p>
In addition to the primary beliefs there are others supposedly not so serious
or significant in their effects. These are usually modifications of primary
beliefs, and are accepted as a consequence of frequent and almost unvaried
repetition. In this manner these secondary beliefs have edged their way into
the popular mind.
</p>

<p>
George Jean Nathan and H. L. Mencken in a recent volume, <i>The American
Credo</i>, point out fairly striking instances of this tendency of the American mind.
They have compiled a series of 435 commonly accepted beliefs covering a wide
range. Among these 435 listed American beliefs there are some very real ones
which involve and include the following popular notions about Negroes:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="phanging">

1. That a Negro's vote may always be readily bought for a dollar.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
2. That every colored cook has a lover who never works and that she feeds him
by stealing the best part of every dish she cooks.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
3. That every Negro who went to France with the army has a liaison with a white
woman and won't look at a colored woman any more.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
4. That all male Negroes can sing.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
5. That if one hits a Negro on the head with a cobblestone the cobblestone will
break.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
6. That all Negroes born south of the Potomac can play the banjo and are excellent
dancers.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
7. That whenever a Negro is educated he refuses to work and becomes a criminal.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
8. That every Negro servant girl spends at least half of her wages on preparations
for taking the kink out of her hair.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
9. That all Negro prize fighters marry white women and then afterwards beat
them.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
10. That all Negroes who show any intelligence are two-thirds white and the sons
of U.S. Senators.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
11. That the minute a Negro gets eight dollars he goes to a dentist and has one
of his front teeth filled with gold.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
12. That a Negro ball always ends up in a grand free-for-all fight in which several
Negroes are mortally slashed with razors.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The most usual of these secondary beliefs which figure in the experience of
Negroes and whites in Chicago are apparently of southern origin. This is due,
not so much to any deliberate effort of southerners to infiltrate them into
northern race relations, as that northerners largely regard as authoritative the
experience of the South which holds almost nine-tenths of the total Negro
population.
</p>

<p>
Some of the secondary beliefs are:
</p>

<p>
1. That Negroes are lazy; that they are indisposed to, though not incapable
of, sustained physical exertion.
</p>

<p>
2. That they are happy-go-lucky; that their improvidence is demonstrated
in their extravagance, and that their reckless disregard for their welfare is shown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_444' name='Page_444' href='#Page_444'>444</a></span>
in a lack of foresight for the essentials of well-being. It is asserted that they
do not purchase homes and do not save their money; that they spend lavishly
for clothes to the neglect of home comforts and the demands even of their
health; that they work by the day, and before the week is ended confuse bookkeeping
by demanding their pay.
</p>

<p>
3. That they are boisterous. Hilarity in public places and especially in
their own gatherings is thought to be common. They are considered as rude
and coarse in public conveyances and are believed to jostle white passengers
sometimes without thought and sometimes out of pure maliciousness.
</p>

<p>
4. That they are bumptious; that when a Negro is placed in a position of
unaccustomed authority relative to his group he has an unduly exaggerated
sense of his own importance and makes himself unbearable.
</p>

<p>
5. That they are overassertive; that constant harping on constitutional
rights is a habit of Negroes, especially of the newer generation; that in their
demands for equal rights and privileges they are egged on by agitators of their
own race and are overinsistent in their demands; that they resent imaginary
insults and are generally supersensitive.
</p>

<p>
6. That they are lacking in civic consciousness. Absence of community
pride and disregard for community welfare are alleged to be the common failing
of Negroes. It is pointed out that the "Black Belt" has been allowed to run
down and become the most unattractive spot in the city. To this fact is attributed
the tolerance of vice within this region. Negroes generally, it is still
believed, can be bought in elections with money and whiskey. They are
charged with having no pride in the beauty of the city, and with making it
unbeautiful by personal and group habits.
</p>

<p>
7. That they usually carry razors. Whenever a newspaper reporter is in
doubt he gives a razor as the weapon used. Some time ago a woman was found
murdered in a town near Chicago. She had been slashed with a razor, and
the broken blade was left beside her body. The murder was particularly
atrocious, and the murderer left no other clew. Several Negroes were arrested
on suspicion but were released when a white youth confessed the crime.
</p>

<p>
A Negro lawyer said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
During the riot a Negro was arrested for having a razor in his pocket. I was his
attorney, and the evidence showed that he always shaved at work. After having
shaved at this particular time, he put his razor in his pocket and forgot it. He started
home and was accosted by two officers, who searched him and found the razor. The
judge heard the evidence and then whispered to me that he was going to give the
fellow ten days because "you know your people do carry razors." He asked me if
I thought it all right and I said that I did not.
</p>
</div>

<p>
8. That they habitually "shoot craps." The Negro's supposed fondness
for gambling is a phase of the belief concerning his improvidence. It is not
unusual for whites, in conversation with any Negro whom they do not know
well, when they wish merely to be friendly, to refer to dice. Employers frequently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_445' name='Page_445' href='#Page_445'>445</a></span>
say that Negroes never keep money because as soon as it is earned it is
thrown away on gambling with dice. The state's attorney believed that the
riot of July, 1919, began over a beach craps game.
</p>

<p>
Negroes are believed to be flashy in dress, loving brilliant and gaudy colors,
especially vivid red. Again, they are believed by white unionists to be natural
strike breakers with deliberate intentions to undermine white living standards.
Similarly they are believed to be fond of gin. Pauperism among them is
believed to be unduly high, and they are thought to have no home life.
</p>

<h4>
II. BACKGROUND OF PREVAILING BELIEFS CONCERNING NEGROES
</h4>

<p>
Lying back of the current opinions about Negroes is a chain of circumstances
involving the history of divers racial groups over hundreds of years. Slavery
placed a stamp upon Negroes which it will require many more years to erase.
Probably there would have been no doubt at all in the minds of Americans
that essential inequalities existed between white and Negro had not their
emancipation developed numerous unsuspected qualities. Thomas Jefferson
is responsible for the observation that "a Negro could scarcely be found who
was capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid."
John C. Calhoun asserted that if a Negro could be found capable of giving the
syntax of a Greek verb he would be disposed to call him human. The Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution fixed the Negro's status
by law, and as soon afterward as his broader contacts with American institutions
provided an outlet for more human participation, serious questions concerning
his fitness for citizenship were put. The first studies that followed
have been accepted for many years as the standard of judgment.

<p>
<i>Mentality.</i>â€”Regarding Negro mentality, Dr. Jeffries Wyman, anatomist of
Harvard University, about 1870, said: "It cannot be denied that the Negro and
ourang do afford the point where man and the brute, when the totality of their
organization is considered, most nearly approach each other."
</p>

<p>
As a corollary he adds:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Negro may be a man and a worker in some secondary sense; he is not a man
and a brother in the same full sense in which every Western Aryan is a man and a
brother. To me the Negro is repulsive.
</p>

<p>
The Negro is not yet a man and he is not yet a brother to the white. It will take
generations, no man can say how many, to bring him to the level of supreme Caucasian
man. He will have to reduce the facial angle and he will have to have a more spacious
cranium before he can come into brotherhood with the more advanced species of mankind.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Professor A. H. Keane, author of <i>Man Past and Present</i>, at least gave some
sanction to the disposition to regard the Negro and Caucasian races as having
nothing in common. To quote from his book, published in 1890:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
No historic or scientific reason can be alleged why these races, black or white,
should be grouped together under one appellation if by such name it is meant to convey
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_446' name='Page_446' href='#Page_446'>446</a></span>
the idea that the human type can have any sanguinary affiliation. In the Negro
groups it is absolutely shown that certain African races, whether born in Africa or
America, give an internal capacity almost identical of 83 cubic inches. It is demonstrated
through monumental, cranial and other testimonials, that the various types of
mankind have ever been permanent; have been independent of all physical influences
for thousands of years.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Dr. J. C. Nott, scientist and author of <i>Types of Mankind</i> said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is mind and mind alone which constitutes the proudest prerogative of man,
whose excellence should be measured by his intelligence and virtue. The Negro and
other unintellectual types have been shown in another chapter to possess heads
much smaller, by actual measurement in cubic inches, than the white races; and
although metaphysicians may dispute about causes which have debased their intellects
and precluded their expansion, it cannot be denied that these dark races are,
in this particular, greatly inferior to the others of fairer complexion.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This school of anthropology very clearly belongs to the period of slavery
when it was necessary to rationalize the wishes of persons who, in order to treat
Negroes as if they were mentally different, had first to convince, then justify,
themselves in so doing.
</p>

<p>
Following them was another type of scientific writers who, while assuming
that Negroes possessed brains, denied that they were like those of white persons
or ever could be.
</p>

<p>
G. Stanley Hall thought that the Negro's development came to at least
partial standstill at puberty. E. B. Tylor, author of <i>Anthropology</i>, assumed,
from the accounts of European teachers who had taught children of the "lower"
races, that after the age of twelve the colored children fell off and were left
behind by the white children. Odum thought that the Negro child's mental
development ended at the age of thirteen. None of these opinions, however,
was the result of experimentation. A. T. Smith, author of <i>A Study of Race
Psychology</i>, is responsible for the association and memory study of what he
called a "typical" Negro boy of sixteen years. He discovered that "the Negro
child is psychologically different from the white child, superior in automatic
power but decidedly inferior in the power of abstraction, judgment and analysis."
A. McDonald, author of <i>Colored Childrenâ€”A Psycho-physical Study</i>,
gave physical and mental tests in 1899 to ninety-one Negro children and concluded
that dulness in colored children sets in between thirteen and sixteen.
M. J. Mayo, author of <i>The Mental Capacity of the American Negro</i>, in 1913
studied 150 white and 150 colored high-school pupils in the schools of New York,
and found the efficiency of colored pupils 76 per cent of that of the white. His
selection included a large number of emigrants from the South, which, he
explained, would increase the quality of the colored group, since only the more
ambitious Negroes would seek to better their conditions by moving North. No
account was taken of the defective school system of the South. Phillips made
a study of retardation in the schools of Philadelphia and concluded that the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_447' name='Page_447' href='#Page_447'>447</a></span>
course of study was not suited to Negroes, since colored children showed a
greater degree of retardation than the whites.
</p>

<p>
Charles Carroll's book on the Negro points out by texts drawn from the
Bible that the Negro is a beast created with an articulate tongue and hands in
order that he may serve his white master. To bear out this theory Carroll's
book says that man has been created in the image of God, but since, as everyone
knows, God is not a Negro, it follows that the Negro is not in the image of
God; therefore he is not a man.
</p>

<p>
There is a plain explanation of the origin of these beliefs. The science of
anthropology itself has remarkably advanced during the past fifty years.
When Negroes emerged from slavery, illiterate and unaccustomed to freedom,
it was natural that their condition should be accepted as evidence that
they could neither learn nor absorb the standards of the civilization around
them. But although their illiteracy, for example, has decreased from 98 to
27 per cent, the original beliefs persist.
</p>

<p>
<i>Morality.</i>â€”The reputation of Negroes for immorality is based largely on
southern authority and is historically explained by reference to slavery, in
which state immorality is asserted to have been common between the master
and the woman slave. There are many authorities on this character trait.
Perhaps the most pretentious study on this subject is by Howard O. Odum in
"Studies in History, Economics and Public Law," Columbia University, 1910.
It is called <i>A Study in Race Traits, Tendencies and Prospects</i>. Writing of
immorality among Negroes, Odum says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It has generally been assumed that the Negro is differentiated by a distinct sexual
development. It is affirmed that the sex development crowds out the mental growth.
It is affirmed that the period of puberty in boys and girls is marked by special manifestations
of wildness and uncontrol. It is true, too, that the practices of the Negroes
leave little energy for moral and mental regeneration. Their lives are filled with that
which is carnal; their thoughts are most filthy and their morals are generally beyond
description. Again, physical developments from childhood are precocious and the
sex life begins at a ridiculously early period. But granting these truths, it is doubtful
if there is sufficient evidence to warrant such a conclusion. The Negro reveals a
strong physical nature; the sex impulse is naturally predominant. But its manifestations
are probably no more violent and powerful than are the expressions of other
feelings already suggested. The Negro's sensuous enjoyment of eating and drinking
and sleeping, relatively speaking, are no less marked than his sexual propensities.
Likewise lack of control and extreme manifestations characterize the discharge of
other impulses. It is true, again, that the part played by sexual life among the
Negroes is large for a people; but to state that the Negro is inherently differentiated
and hindered by a sexual development out of proportion to other physical qualities
is quite a different proposition. But whether the question here raised is answered in
the affirmative or not, it still remains that in the practical life of the Negro his better
impulses are warped and hindered by his unreasonable abuse of sexual license. And
it is safe to suggest that the Negro need hope for little development of his best qualities
until he has learned to regulate and control his animal impulses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_448' name='Page_448' href='#Page_448'>448</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Statistics on illegitimate births and abortions are frequently quoted as
evidence of Negro immorality. It is further asserted, with rarely an attempt
at correction, that these immoral tendencies are responsible for rape and
attempted rape of white women.
</p>

<p>
Tradition maintains that it is a part of Negro nature to desire a white
woman and similarly a part of his nature to be lacking in those restraints and
inhibitions which might control this desire. C. H. McCord, author of <i>The
American Negro as a Dependent, Defective, and Delinquent</i>, said: "The average
Negro is a child in every essential element of character, exhibiting those characteristics
that indicate a tendency to lawless impulse and weak inhibition."
</p>

<p>
Numerous magazine articles and written studies in the South on this subject
have given weight to this belief through sheer repetition. It is now not
necessary to prove assertions or present an array of instances; they are taken
for granted. Allusions to the "well-known immoral character" of the Negro
or his instinctive tendency to commit sex crimes appear to carry as strong an
impress of certainty as proved conclusions.
</p>

<p>
<i>Other supposed social characteristics.</i>â€”Discussions of each of the characteristics
mentioned and many others are found in the literature on the subject.
It will suffice here to give selections typical of the trend of descriptions to
indicate the manner in which the picture of the Negro in practically every
phase of his life has been set. Of his industrial habits Odum, in the social
study of the Negro, says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In any discussion of the economic situation this (the question of the efficiency
of Negro labor) is an important consideration. A portion of the Negroes wander
about and seek to get a living as best they can without working for it; they must
necessarily live at the expense of the other Negroes and the whites. The number of
vagrants in every community is surprisingly large. They are naturally divided into
several groups; those who never work but wander from place to place, never fixed
and without a home, stealing, begging, and obtaining a living from any source possible.
Such men never work except when forced to do so in little jobs or on the streets or in
the chain gang.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Of the Negro's social affairs he says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The description of one of these [Negro] dances would be repulsive. The Negroes
have "good times" on such occasions and will go a long distance to attend. The whole
trend of the dance is toward physical excitation; they are without order and the influence
is totally bad.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Of the condition of the Negro's home:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It will be seen that there is little orderly home life among the Negroes. Health
conditions and daily habits are no better than the arrangement of the house. Sometimes
an entire family consisting of father, mother, large and small children occupy
the same rooms. Nor do they ventilate, and especially when any of the inmates are
sick they are loath to let in the fresh air. Physicians testify that three or four often
sleep in a bed together; they do not change clothing before going to bed in many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_449' name='Page_449' href='#Page_449'>449</a></span>
cases, and often go for many days without a change of garments. It has been suggested
that the personal habits of the Negroes are filthy; such is the case. Filth and
uncleanness are everywhere predominant.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Of his religion:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In spite of pretentions and superficiality, there is nothing so real to the Negro as
his religion, although it is a different "reality" from what we commonly expect in
religion. The Negro is more excitable in his nature, and yields more readily to excitement
than does the white man. The more a thing excites him, the more reality it
has for him....
</p>

<p>
The criminal instinct appears to overbalance any consciousness which makes
for righteousness, and the Negro has little serene consciousness of a clean record;
he is ready to rush at any surprising or suspicious turn of affairs. The Negro does not
value his word of honor; he apparently cannot always tell the truth. Only about one
in every ten will keep an important engagement made in seriousness.
</p>

<p>
The Negro's conception of heaven and hell, God and the devil are very distinct.
Heaven is an eternal resting-place where he shall occupy the best place. He sings of
his heavenly home in striking contrast to his earthly abode. Perhaps for the reason
that the Negroes have little satisfactory home life, they expect to have a perfect home
in the next life.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Of his finer emotions:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
While it is doubtful if there is enough evidence to warrant a full statement concerning
the affections of the Negroes, it is apparently based on the gregarious impulse
and upon a passive sympathy rather than upon individual emotions intellectually
developed. The emotion is rarely of long duration.... The Negro mother rarely
mourns for her wandering child, or sits up at night waiting for his return or thinking
of him. The father shows little care except that of losing a laborer from his work....
The Negro has no loved ones. Numbers were asked for the names of those
whom they considered friends or whom they loved or those who loved them. The
question was put in various ways with different subjects, but the returns were the
same.... But as a rule the Negro is without friendship among his own people.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It may help to comprehend the range of conclusions found in the literature
on the subject of Negro traits of character to note the array of descriptive adjectives
employed, thus: sensual, lazy, unobservant, shiftless, unresentful, emotional,
shallow, patient, amiable, gregarious, expressive, appropriative, childish,
religious, unmoral, immoral, ignorant, mentally inferior, criminal, excitable,
imitative, repulsive, poetic, irresponsible, filthy, unintellectual, bumptious,
overassertive, superficial, indecent, dependent, untruthful, musical, ungrateful,
loyal, sporty, provincial, anthropomorphic, savage, brutish, happy-go-lucky,
careless, plastic, docile, apish, inferior, cheerful.
</p>

<p>
Much might be said of influences which have operated to counteract the
opinion-making literature as to the utterly hopeless condition of Negroes. The
object of this study, however, is not to attack these conclusions, but merely
to cite them as indicating how certain attitudes detrimental to racial friendliness
and understanding have had their rise.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_450' name='Page_450' href='#Page_450'>450</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In academic circles the more balanced opinions of anthropologists are gaining
some headway. Franz Boaz, probably the foremost anthropologist in the
United States, in <i>The Mind of Primitive Man</i>, maintains:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Our considerations make it probable that the wide differences between the manifestations
of the human mind in various stages of culture may be due almost entirely
to the form of individual experience, which is determined by the geographical and
social environment of the individual. It would seem that, in different races, the
organization of the mind is on the whole alike, and that the variations of mind found
in different races do not exceed, perhaps not even reach, the amount of normal individual
variation in each race. It has been indicated that, notwithstanding this
similarity in the form of individual mental processes, the expression of mental activity
of a community tends to show a characteristic historical development.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This author in an article in the <i>Nation</i> for December, 1920, comments thus
on Lothrop Stoddard's book, <i>The Rising Tide of Color</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Mr. Stoddard's book is one of the long series of publications devoted to the self-admiration
of the white race, which begins with Gobineau and comes down to us
through Chamberlain and, with increasingly passionate appeal, through Madison
Grant to Mr. Stoddard. The newer books of this type try to bolster up their unscientific
theories by an amateurish appeal to misunderstood discoveries relating to heredity
and give in this manner a scientific guise to their dogmatic statements which misleads
the public. For this reason the books must be characterized as vicious propaganda,
and gain an attention not warranted by an intrinsic merit in their learning or their
logic.
</p>

<p>
Each race is exceedingly variable in all of its features, and we find in the white
race, as well as in all other races, all grades of intellectual capacity, from the imbecile
to the man of high intellectual power. It is true that intellectual power is hereditary
in the individual, and that the healthy, the physically and mentally developed individuals
of a race, if they marry among themselves, are liable to have offspring of a
similar excellence; but it is equally true that the inferior individuals in a race will
also have inferior offspring. If, therefore, it were entirely a question of eugenic
development of humanity, then the aid of the eugenist would be to suppress not the
gifted strains of other races, but rather the inferior strains of our own race. A selection
of the intelligent, energetic and highly endowed individuals from all over the
world would not by any means leave the white race as the only survivors, but would
leave an assembly of individuals who would probably represent all the different
races of man now in existence.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Jean Finot, in <i>Race Prejudice</i>, says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
When we go through the list of external differences which appear to divide men,
we find literally nothing which can authorize their division into superior and inferior
beings, into masters and pariahs. If this division exists in our thought, it only came
there as the result of inexact observations and false opinions drawn from them.
</p>

<p>
The science of inequality is emphatically a science of white people. It is they who
have invented it and set it going, who have maintained, cherished, and propagated it,
thanks to their observations and their deductions. Deeming themselves greater
than men of other colours, they have elevated into superior qualities all the traits
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_451' name='Page_451' href='#Page_451'>451</a></span>
which are peculiar to themselves, commencing with the whiteness of the skin and the
pliancy of the hair. But nothing proves that these vaunted traits are traits of real
superiority.
</p>
</div>

<p>
W. I. Thomas, in <i>Sex and Society</i>, concludes his discussion of relative
mentality with this statement:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The real variable is the individual, not the race. In the beginningâ€”perhaps as
the result of a mutation or series of mutationsâ€”a type of brain developed which has
remained relatively fixed in all times and among all races. This brain will never have
any faculty in addition to what it now possesses, because as a type of structure it is
as fixed as the species itself, and is indeed a mark of species. It is not apparent that
we are greatly in need of another faculty, or that we could make use of it even if by a
chance mutation it should emerge, since with the power of abstraction we are able to
do any class of work we know anything about.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
III. TYPES OF SENTIMENTS AND ATTITUDES
</h4>

<p>
In the South the relations between the white and Negro races are
determined by custom as well as law, which, however, permit the close personal
relationships of family servants. In the North, when these relations become
more impersonal and contacts are widened through change of occupation
from domestic service to industry, these close personal ties are weakened.
There is no established rule of conduct binding on whites and Negroes
in their relations with each other; and although traditional beliefs may
influence present relations in the North, they do not always dominate
them. So it happens that there are to be found shades of opinion concerning
Negroes varying from deliberate indifference to vituperative abuse of Negroes,
whatever the subject, depending on one's beliefs about them. The selections
of sentiment which follow are examples collected at random over the cityâ€”through
interviews and discussions, from group publications, speeches and
reports. They illustrate the real sentiments that white persons express when
brought into contact with Negroes, or when their opinions are solicited.
</p>

<h5>
1. THE EMOTIONAL BACKGROUND
</h5>

<p>
<i>Hostile sentiment.</i>â€”The refusal of Policeman Callahan to arrest Stauber, a
white youth accused of throwing stones which resulted in the drowning of
Eugene Williams, is regarded as the significant incident precipitating the riot
of 1919 (see <a href="#Page_4">p. 4</a>). Callahan was dismissed from the force, but reinstated.
One year later, when questioned by an investigator for the Commission, he
gave his racial philosophy freely in the following remarks:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
So far as I can learn the black people have since history began despised the white
people and have always fought them.... It wouldn't take much to start another
riot, and most of the white people of this district are resolved to make a clean-up this
time.... If a Negro should say one word back to me or should say a word to a
white woman in the park, there is a crowd of young men of the district, mostly ex-service
men, who would procure arms and fight shoulder to shoulder with me if trouble
should come from the incident.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_452' name='Page_452' href='#Page_452'>452</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The following is from a letter written by a white employee of Albert Pick
&amp; Company:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Negroes in street cars refuse to double up with others of their race, but seem
to delight in sitting beside some dainty white girl.
</p>

<p>
The Thirty-fifth Street cars are crowded by low-grade "plantation niggers"
who crowd on at Ashland Avenue via windows and doors, then awkwardly step and
fall over passengers; it is maddening. About this time girls from Albert Pick &amp; Company,
the Magnus Company, and the tailoring establishments are crowded together
breast to breast with Negroes. Often he falls asleep and leans on his white seatmate's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Laws should be urged preventing intermarriage.
</p>

<p>
Assaults upon white women are frequent, but hushed up by fear of newspaper
publicity, and the Negro is thus encouraged in his felony.
</p>

<p>
In cases where a white girl is involved in an assault case by a colored man, the
white woman should be shielded, and her name withheld from the newspapers and
public, before and after the trial. This will prevent race riots.
</p>

<p>
A movement is now afoot to declare a silent boycott against employers of colored
help.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A physician living on Oakwood Boulevard said: "The increasing amount
generally of sex immorality is being contributed to by mixing Negroes and
whites in schools and parks."
</p>

<p>
A teacher in the Felsenthal School said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The colored people are coming from the South all the time, for political purposes.
It's propaganda for the colored man to sit down by the white woman, and not to double
up to make room for the whites. Their papers tell them to do it. I was the only white
person in an empty car one day and a colored man came in and took the seat beside me.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Fear.</i>â€”From <i>White Americans</i> circulated in Chicago:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In the United States Negroes not only vote and hold office, but the Negro vote
is the deciding factor in the national elections, and also in many of the northern
cities, and they trade their vote for jobs and offices and other privileges. The Negroes
control the great city of Philadelphia, and the press said the Negro delegates at the
Republican Convention in Chicago openly offered to sell their support to the presidential
candidate who would pay the most money. Just think this thing over, you
sovereign United States citizens: the Negroes control the elections, and thus your
law-makers, judges, and officials; and the Negroes have so much pull and confidence,
that they not only defend their political rights, but they start riots and race wars,
and openly threaten that they are going to make the white folks stand around.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Fear and pity.</i>â€”A resident in the 6600 block on Langley Avenue said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A colored family lives next door north of me, and you'll be surprised when I tell
you that I haven't been able to open my bedroom window on that side to air that
room for three years. I couldn't think of unlocking the windows because their window
is so near somebody could easily step across into this house. It's awful to have to
live in such fear of your life.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_453' name='Page_453' href='#Page_453'>453</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
When asked if she considered her neighbors so dangerous as that, she said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Well, no, the woman seems pretty nice. I see her out in the back yard occasionally
and bid her the time of day out of charity. You can't help but pity them, so I am
charitable and speak. Where the danger really is, is that you never know who's in
their house; they bring such trash to the neighborhood, even if they are good and
decent. How do I know what kind of people this woman next door associates with?
There's awful-looking people sit on the front porch sometimes. Why, I couldn't
sit on my porch on the hottest day because I'd be afraid they would come out any
minute. And what white person will sit on a porch next door to a porch with black
ones on it? Not me, anyhow, nor you either I hope.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Hostile but resigned.</i>â€”A resident near Dorchester Avenue and Sixtieth
Street said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have nothing against the black man as a black man. He comes into my place
of business (drug-store) and I sell him. Not many come in, as there aren't a lot
of colored people around Sixty-third and Woodlawn or Dorchester. But I don't
want to live with niggers any more than you or any other white person does. People
who say, "I like the colored people and don't see why others can't get along with
them" don't talk practical common sense. Theoretically all this talk is all right, but
you get a white man of this sort to come right down and live with a nigger and he
won't do it.
</p>

<p>
Niggers are different from whites and always will be, and that is why white
people don't want them around. But the only thing we can do, it seems to me, is make
the best of it and live peaceably with them. The North can never do what the South
doesâ€”down there it is pure autocracy. I might say like Russia. That might have
worked here in the North from the start, but can't be started now, and we wouldn't
want such autocracy anyway. They are citizens, and it is up to us to teach them to
be good ones. How it can be done I don't knowâ€”it will have to come slow, and no
one can give a solution offhand. Everybody says, "We don't want the niggers with
us." Well, here they are, and we can't do anything. Must let them live where they
want to and go to school where they want to, and we don't want to force their right
away.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is not uncommon to find in some circles and with many individuals a
resolute indisposition to discuss any phase of the Negro problem. Convictions
regarding the race are so firmly set and hostile that no argument or appeal to
fair-mindedness can alter their position.
</p>

<p>
"Eye Witness," a special writer for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, encountered this
state of mind in interviewing whites and Negroes for a series of articles on the
Negro question which appeared in the <i>Tribune</i> in May, 1919. He characterized
it as insensate and dangerous. His own statement, published May 4,
1919, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Among men like publicists and administrators of large affairs, who, when they
discuss the problems and troubles of their race, are wont to speak in a rational, or
at least mannerly way, there was often an unfeeling kind of don't-give-a-damn cry
when they talked on this subject that made one wonder how they had managed so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_454' name='Page_454' href='#Page_454'>454</a></span>
well in maintaining a human and successful relationship with their white associates
in business and with their employees.
</p>

<p>
I heard more, far more, insensate language from the lips of white men than of
black men throughout the series of interviews. The horrible part of that, to me,
was that when a white employer more or less accountable for the well-being of colored
workmen, or a publicist entrusted with a pen that forms and directs opinions, had
railed about "these damn niggers" they appeared to think they had said something
rather gallant and decisive, for they would smile fatuously and expect acquiescence.
</p>

<p>
And more terrible than the language was the insensate state of mind such language
betrayed. The only way one could avoid the suspicion that one was listening to a
potential lunatic or a desperately stupid person without a human or a community
sense, was to allow much for the vehemence of the American tongue and to concede
that these men don't mean one-tenth of what they say. If they did they would be
fomenters of race wars.

2. SENTIMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS
</h5>

<p>
<i>Sentiment for the "old family servants."</i>â€”A white physician born in the
South said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My father owned slaves. He looked out for them; told them what to do. He
loved them and they loved him. I was brought up during and after the war. I had
a "black mammy" and she was devoted to me and I to her; and I played with Negro
children. In a way I'm fond of the Negro; I understand him and he understands me;
but the bond between us is not as close as it was between my father and his slaves.
On the other hand, my children have grown up without black playmates and without
a "black mammy." The attitude of my children is less sympathetic toward the
Negroes than my own. They don't know each other.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Paternal relationship.</i>â€”In testimony before the Commission a witness said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The prejudice against the colored people in the South isn't as strong in some
instances as it is in the North. It's a queer thing, but the white man in the South,
and the white woman, too, has a sort of paternal feeling that he must look after him
and that the colored man's interests are better in his hands than if he is left to drift
for himself. I don't state that as an actual fact, but I believe it is true. That is
their point of view. They don't hate the colored man. They don't dislike him, but I
should say this, that they won't take him into their homes. They don't dislike him,
provided he keeps his place. I believe the white people of the South think more of
the Negro than the white people of the North.

3. ABSTRACT JUSTICE
</h5>

<p>
A trained nurse of Woodlawn said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I meet colored people only on the cars. There are none anywhere around here,
I believe. I don't know how I would feel if they came to Woodlawn to live. But
they must live, and I hear their quarters are getting too small. It seems that Chicago
ought to let them live somewhere. Some people treat Negroes terrible and I think
that is all wrong. Why can't we act respectably toward colored people on the cars
and treat them nice on the street? We surely don't want to be like the people in
the South who make colored persons get off the walk when they come along. But
I see white people here almost that badâ€”can't see a black man live.

<p>
The pastor of a church in Woodlawn said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have come to no final conclusion as to the best policy to pursue in the adjustment
of the race problem. I am thinking about it a great deal and am deeply concerned
over the whole matter. In the present state of popular mind, there is no
doubt but property values are depreciated by the presence of Negro tenants or property
owners in residential sections. However, if everyone felt as I do, it would not
be so. I mean, provided that the same general social standards were observed by all
nationalities in the city. It would be very fine, it seems to me, to maintain certain
standards in each neighborhood. Why not bring pressure to bear on white landlords
and make them keep their property up to a given average standard in the community,
that only such a class of people will rent or buy as are already there? I am very
anxious that the Negro shall be treated fairly. I do not want him to feel that I have
stood in the way of his opportunities and his rights.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A professor at the University of Chicago said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The final solution, it seems to me, must come as a result of honest and successful
efforts for mutual understanding between the races. There must be apparent on the
part of the white race an attempt to treat the Negro with justice, and I feel sure that
he will respond. I do not think the black race, as a race, desires intermarriage more
than the white race, yet the assertion to the contrary is much overworked by the white
opposition in these neighborhoods.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A minister said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
All I want for the Negro is justiceâ€”then I think the economic laws will settle
this problem. Let the people interested try justice; they will find it will solve the
race problem faster than any other course, just as it will solve any other problem.
Treat the bad Negro just as rough as you treat the bad white man, but acclaim the
good Negro after the same manner of your acclamation of the good white man.

<h5>
4. SENTIMENTS STRONGER THAN RACE PREJUDICE
</h5>

<p>
<i>Class kinship stronger than race.</i>â€”A Swedish employee in a department
store said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have quite a number of Negro neighbors where I live, and several black men
work with me, and I want to say I think they are just as good as anybody. There
are classes of people in every race, and of course there is a rough element among the
blacks. Some highbrows try to make out that they are representative, but I think
opposition to the Negro in Chicago comes from the "swell" class. I do not have
any different feeling for them than for the same kind of people in any other race.
I think race relations will get better in Chicago. The workingman has learned that
the Negro will treat him right when he is treated right, and as soon as the other
folks find that out, things will be all right.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The secretary of the Cook County Labor Party said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have thought about this problem a good deal, and I think you will find it is the
so-called middle class that is making all the trouble. The laboring-man does not care
who his neighbor is, so long as he is a good neighbor. I think you can trace most of
the racial activities to jealousy on the part of a certain class of American citizens who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_456' name='Page_456' href='#Page_456'>456</a></span>
are not any too wealthy and feel constrained to maintain a sort of fictitious position
in life at the expense of anybody, in this case the Negroes. You will find that the
very well-to-do are not nearly so much aroused over the problem.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A Japanese said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think it is simply a matter of race prejudice, which of course means first of all
that the color is not acceptable, while, in the second place, they were imported to the
United States as slaves, and thus it always occurs in the American mind that they
are a lower class of people. Furthermore, as they were slaves and the American does
not like them, they don't have equal opportunities to educate themselves up to such a
degree which means no more than environment. In the last place, they want to keep
away from them. I think it might be said that they are willing to receive lower
wages, which tends to lower the wage system; thus the American worker suffers a
good deal. In the whole process the Negroes have been kept out of social and political
activities that would have given them a chance to develop. Allow them to have
these activities in the future and they will make more rapid progress than they have
even in the past.
</p>

<p>
<i>General historical comparisons.</i>â€”A Jewish resident of the West Side said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I believe that the segregation movement is wrong because it is unjust and because
it is devoid of any principle whatever. It has not risen out of the consideration of
the needs of the colored people, nor out of consideration of real advantages that the
whites might thereby gain. What is back of race prejudice? Nothing more than
the spirit of superiority and selfishness which moves the aristocrats to move out of a
neighborhood as soon as a few common people move in. This is here too prevalent.
The segregation movement has its parallel in history. Who does not remember the old
Jewish Ghetto of Amsterdam, Frankfort, etc., or the Pale of Russia? What has this
segregation done for the Jews? It curtailed their rise, depriving them of an opportunity
to develop, and I foresee the same result in the new segregation movement,
and therefore deem it a great public evil and moral issue.

<p>
A window dresser said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I am from the South, and I am used to seeing the Negro kept in his place. I would
colonize them, every one of them, and make them stay where they are put. I would
colonize them in Africa if I had to do it. There's where they came from and there's
where they belong. Of course, some few northern folks say that they were taken
away against their own wills, but I say they ought to go back against their own wills.

<p>
The woman manager of a tailor shop, Fifty-fifth Street, said: "I am a

6. GROUP SENTIMENTS
</h5>

<p>
<i>Fear of social censure.</i>â€”A property owner at Langley Avenue and Fifty-fifth

</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I am not proud to be living on the same street with Negroes, so I never tell my
friendsâ€”they would say: 'You must move out.'"

George L. Giles Post of the American Legion is a Negro post with headquarters
at the South Side Branch of the Community Service. Invitations
to a musicale and dramatic entertainment for the benefit of ex-service men were
sent to all the local posts by the Community Service. It was responded to by
the adjutant of George L. Giles Post, who received a reply from the executive
secretary saying:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

I am quite sure you will understand that our sending one to the George L.

<p>
Similar recognition of the force of public opinion may be found in industry.
The manager of a large industrial plant, speaking of Negro workmen, said: "I
have a feeling that white workers would object to Negroes in any position but
that of common laborers, although I have no basis for this opinion." Another
said: "I have heard whites remark that they wouldn't want to work here if
many colored were employed but none left on that account."

<h5>
7. ATTITUDES DETERMINED BY CONTACTS
</h5>

<p>
<i>No contacts but a hostile attitude.</i>â€”A resident at Drexel Avenue and Sixty-fifth
Street said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I don't see many niggers around here; most of them are west of Cottage Grove
Avenue. I never had any dealings with them, so can't tell you anything much. I
know I don't want niggers living next door to me, but I can't tell you why. Do you
want them next-door neighbors to you? There are some living down in the next
blockâ€”two families of themâ€”between Sixty-fourth and Sixty-fifth, and I guess
they are pretty wild, but I have never seen them. It's just what people tell me. I
never had any dealings with them.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Generalization from a particular experience.</i>â€”A teacher in the Wendell
Phillips High School said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
You can't trust the best of them. The minute you have your back turned something
disappears. They are the worst bunch of little thieves I ever struck. A
few weeks ago I had a colored girl helping me fix costumes in my little office. During
the hour she was in there I was absent about five minutes. She had hardly got out
of the building before I discovered that a dollar had disappeared out of my purse. I
questioned her for thirty minutes next morning, but not a word of confession.
Another time I had small change in the top drawer of my desk. While I was teaching
a class, two girls slipped into the office and helped themselves to half of it. I surprised
them when I unexpectedly entered the office to get something. Everything here
that isn't tied or watched walks off. It didn't used to be this way before the colored
came in so thick; then I never locked my office, and now I have everything under lock.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The proprietor of a woman's dress shop on Sixty-third Street said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Little of my trade is colored, possibly 2 per cent. We do not cater to colored
trade. We do not want it. If colored people come in, we will sell them if they buy
quick and get out. Our trade does not care to deal where colored people are also
accommodated.... You will find it pretty hard to be neutral in Chicago. The
more I know of niggers, the more I am convinced that there is no good nigger but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_458' name='Page_458' href='#Page_458'>458</a></span>
a dead one. I had a colored helper who wanted tips every time he was asked to render
services outside of his recognized regular duties. I gave him a good salary, $18 per
week, and yet he was never satisfied, and one day he got hold of the keys to the cash
drawer and ran away with $300.

<p>
<i>Exaggerated notion of prosperity.</i>â€”A physician said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think that the solution of the race problem can come only by recognition by
white men of the Negroes' potential equality. They are only fifty years out of
slavery, and in that fifty years they have progressed faster than the white race has
done in a hundred years. The Negro man of forty today is less advanced than the
white man of forty, but I expect his son to be almost on a par with our sons, and his
grandson will be every whit as good. The husband of the colored woman who has
been getting our dinners for us for a number of years is making more killing steers for
Armour than I am. He makes $16 a day. They have $12,000 worth of Liberty
bonds. They are sending all of their relatives through high school and declare they
will put them through the University of Chicago. In fact we are compelling the
Negro to get an education, and he cannot help but progress. Colonizing the Negro is
merely making him bitter and postponing the day of settlement. Presently we shall
have with us under such a rÃ©gime a race of comparative equals very much disgruntled
by the unfair treatment accorded them. I think you will find that practically all
the professional men in this building, at least a very large percentage of them, think
as I do on this subject.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Contact with servants.</i>â€”A resident of Woodlawn said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Practically my only contact with Negroes is with servants and laundresses.
I have had colored women working for me for many years, and the majority of them
I could not trust outside my sight. By that I don't mean they would stealâ€”they
just weren't dependable. It is all wrong for colored children and white children to
be in school together. There should be separate schools, because the two races of
children are as different in everything as in their color.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The interviewing of hundreds of white persons, members of practically
every social class, reveals little information regarding the sources of their
beliefs about Negroes. Some think them instinctive; some hold that their
opinions are a result of observation; some, who make discernible effort to stem
the current of prejudiced views and remain fair, have read the books of Negroes.
But by far the greater number either admit or otherwise give evidence of having
absorbed their views from tradition.
</p>

<p>
Information by word of mouth, unquestioned statements, uncorrected
accounts, all continue to add credence to any current interpretation of an act
involving Negroes. The fault lies for the most part at the information source.
Fairly to judge the Negro group, or any member thereof, there should be some
unquestioned basis of fact, yet the assumption is common that almost any
Negro can be judged by what has been observed in the conduct of the family
cook or chauffeur, who no more represents the whole or the majority of Negroes
than a white cook or chauffeur can be said to represent the whole or the majority
of the white race.

<h4>
IV. SELF-ANALYSIS BY FIFTEEN WHITE CITIZENS
</h4>

<p>
To secure definite information upon this background twenty representative
white persons were selected at random, and eighteen carefully prepared suggestive
questions were put to each of them. The purpose was to draw out the
raw material of their unqualified opinions on the question of the Negro, and to
ascertain as far as possible the background in their early experiences. The
questions were suggestive in order to compel a disclosure of mental attitudes.
The only qualification in the selection of persons was their probable capacity
for self-analysis and a willingness to answer. The length and difficulty of the
questions put made it necessary to limit the selection of persons to a few, who
in appreciation of the inquiry, could and would give it a careful study. Fifteen
of these persons entered into the spirit of the inquiry and submitted the results
of their self-scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
These fifteen include business and professional men and women, none of
whom, however, is actively associated with racial movements. They represent
probably a fair sample of sentiment and at the same time ability to analyze
accurately their own feelings and opinions.
</p>

<p>
The questions put were as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. Have you formed definite opinions about Negroes? Briefly, what are they?
</p>

<p>
2. Do Negroes in your opinion possess distinguishing traits of mentality or character?
</p>

<p>
3. As well as you can remember, on what facts, authorities, information, sources, do
you base your opinions?
</p>

<p>
4. What incidents or experiences involving Negroes either in Chicago or elsewhere
stand out in your memory?
</p>

<p>
5. As a child, did you have contacts of any kind with Negroes?
</p>

<p>
6. Can you recall any early prohibitions of association by word or printed warnings
of any sort, implied prohibitions in institutional or social arrangements?
</p>

<p>
7. When were you first conscious of a racial difference?
</p>

<p>
8. Whom of your friends, acquaintances, favorite authors, scholars, etc., do you
regard as best fitted to speak with authority on the question?
</p>

<p>
9. Do you ever inquire for information on this subject? Whom do you ask? What
Negroes do you know whom you would consider leaders among colored people in
Chicago? in the United States?
</p>

<p>
10. Did you ever read a Negro periodical? What did you think of it?
</p>

<p>
11. What subjects of discussion most frequently lead to the Negro?
</p>

<p>
12. In what circles is this subject most frequently discussed?
</p>

<p>
13. If it were in your power to make whatever social adjustment you deemed wise,
what disposition would you make of the Negro population?
</p>

<p>
14. If Negroes obstinately objected to your plan and you still had power, what would
you do?
</p>

<p>
15. What do you think of the following propositions:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>a</i>) When you educate Negroes you increase their demands. Either their education
should be curtailed or modified or their demands granted.
</p>

<p>
<i>b</i>) Prejudice has its principal basis in fear.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_460' name='Page_460' href='#Page_460'>460</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>c</i>) Isolating groups favors the unhampered development of special group prejudices.
Do prejudices form a background of conflicts? The greater the
isolation, the greater the prejudices and, as would naturally follow, the greater
the chances of conflict.
</p>

<p>
<i>d</i>) A minority of the population should not expect complete justice at the hands of
an overwhelming majority.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Their answers are given separately. The letters used to designate the
different persons are arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
Aâ€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have rather definite opinions of Negroes. As a class they cannot be depended
upon. They are shiftless and really must be treated like children. I make allowance
for the fact that they have not the years of education back of them.
</p>

<p>
My opinions are based on visits made to the South and on information obtained
from relatives who live in the South as well as from the colored help we have had. As a
child my contact with Negroes began with our Negro house servants, and my first
consciousness of a racial difference came while visiting relatives in the South. I know
but two persons who might speak with authority on the race question. They are
Edgar A. Bancroft and Miss Mary McDowell. It is very seldom that I inquire for
information on this subject. People whom I know are not interested in the problem.
</p>

<p>
The only Negroes whom I know are my present colored help and those who have
worked for me. I don't know whom to consider leaders among the colored people
either in Chicago or in the United States. Concerning the Negro periodicals, I
have occasionally read copies of one of their newspapers which bore out my opinion
of their simple minds. Discussion of domestic help and of newspaper articles about
Negroes and sociological conditions most frequently lead to the discussion of the Negro
in my circle. If it were in my power to do so, I would segregate Negroes as to living
quarters and do all possible to help them educate and help themselves.
</p>

<p>
Concerning proposition (<i>a</i>) I agree that if you educate Negroes, you increase their
demands, but I also believe that as they become educated, greater demands will arise
in their own groups.
</p>

<p>
In my opinion prejudice has its principal basis in the fact that one can't depend
upon Negroes.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe that it is necessarily true that a minority of the population should
not expect complete justice at the hands of the majority if the proper appeal is made.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Bâ€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have more or less definite opinions about Negroes. I believe that as a race they
are entitled to more leniency and consideration than we would give to adult whites
because as a race they are not as mature as whites. I think it is unfortunate that we
have such a race question to deal with, but we ought to meet it squarely and insist
that under the law Negroes are entitled to equal protection and equal consideration.
I do not believe in any attempt at social equality because the antipathy between
whites and Negroes is so acute that such attempt would not only break down itself
but it would lead to serious race difficulties. I think the Negro race has as much right
to protect its race purity as the white race. I believe Negro women are entitled to the
same protection from white men that we demand on behalf of white women against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_461' name='Page_461' href='#Page_461'>461</a></span>
black men. I believe Negroes should have decent housing conditions, proper social
outlets and opportunities to earn a living at the same wages paid white men for the
same class and character of work. They should share equally in the benefits of government,
with particular reference to schools, bathing-beaches, playgrounds, parks,
etc. They should be protected against exploitation by employers, property owners,
merchants, etc.
</p>

<p>
I do think Negroes possess distinguishing traits of both mentality and character.
For many years now I have come into more or less personal contact with Negroes.
I have been in contact with them in public schools, in colleges, in politics and in civic
work. I cannot say that any particular incidents or experiences stand out in my
memory.
</p>

<p>
My opinions are based upon my personal observation, personal contacts with
Negroes and discussions with other white persons having independent contacts. As a
child I had practically no real contact of any kind with Negroes. I don't recall now
any Negro children in any of my primary grades, and while there were Negroes in my
native city, they were few and in a neighborhood far removed from my own home.
I imagine that I was first conscious of a racial difference when I first saw a Negro.
</p>

<p>
I don't recall any early prohibition against association with Negroes although I
do recall clearly that the attitude of my family and associates, generally, was not one
of approval. Negroes were regarded as an inferior race, and I think as a child I
gathered the impression that contact with them was to be avoided. My feeling is
that if in normal circumstances I had been thrown into more or less contact with
Negroes, prohibition against association, except where absolutely necessary, would
have been forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
I have never formally asked for information on the subject, but I have discussed
the matter with a good many people and have given thought to it. I know a good
many Negroes, not only in Chicago but outside, but I don't know many of them
intimately. Among the leaders of the Negroes in Chicago are Dr. Bentley, Dr.
George C. Hall, Edward H. Morris, Edward H. Wright, Louis B. Anderson, Oscar
De Priest. In the United States, since the death of Booker T. Washington, I imagine
that two of the outstanding men are Mr. Moton and Professor Du Bois.
</p>

<p>
I am a subscriber to the <i>Crisis</i>. In general my feeling is that the tendency of this
periodical is to stimulate and foster race feeling among the Negroes. I don't say this
critically. It may be the best thing to do, considering all the circumstances, and
anything that will make for growth in self-respect, character and initiative on the
part of the Negroes is to be commended even if, at the same time, race spirit is fostered
and developed.
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, I find that discussion most frequently leads to the Negroes
when there are questions of lynching, race riots, crimes or disturbances in which
Negroes are involved. It also comes up in connection with public schools, churches,
parks and public transportation systems. I had it arise recently in connection with
the Naval Academy at Annapolis. My experience is that this subject is most frequently
discussed among those interested in social problems.
</p>

<p>
I used to think that the Negro question might be best solved if the Negroes would
be colonized in some favorable spot in Africa under an American protectorate until
they were capable of self-government. I realize, however, that no such scheme ought
to be attempted if the Negroes obstinately objected, and in that event I would see to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_462' name='Page_462' href='#Page_462'>462</a></span>
it, if I had the power, that they were protected from exploitation, were given a square
deal and had the equal protection of the laws. They should have schools adequate to
their needs and average living conditions.
</p>

<p>
I believe the Negro race should be educated, but I believe at the same time that
the most solid foundation for the race is education in accordance with the ideas of the
late Booker T. Washington as I understand those ideas. While I think this type of
education will mean more for the race in the long run I believe at the same time that
individual Negroes should have an opportunity fully to develop individual capacities.
</p>

<p>
I think there is an element of fear in the prejudice of Negroes, but I don't think this
is the chief element. I think the real basis for this prejudice is a racial antipathy that
is instinctive and fundamental in the white race. I imagine that in individual cases
where this prejudice does not exist it is not because it was not there originally, but
because it has been overcome by reason and education. It isn't unlikely that this
prejudice is in the main grounded upon an instinct in the white race to keep its strain
pure and strong.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that it isn't isolation so much as it is contact that favors the development
of race prejudice. If the Negroes had never been brought out of Africa, we
wouldn't feel the prejudice that we do. Or, if they were restricted to one or two
southern states, prejudice in other parts of the country would rapidly disappear.
A community that has no Negro problem is relatively free from prejudice. It is
when the two races come into contact that prejudices run riot and race conflicts result.
My own opinion is that if you should scatter the Negro population throughout Chicago
and its suburbs and put one or two Negro families in every block, race prejudice
would increase enormously.
</p>

<p>
A minority of the population will not get complete justice at the hands of an
overwhelming majority. But this is true of all minorities, whether racial, political,
or religious. All we can do is to keep working for an approximation to ideal justice.
A minority has the right to demand, and a majority should be willing to grant, substantial
justice and that is all that can be expected in the present state of civilization.

My opinion is that we must cling to the ideal of Lincolnâ€”the right of every
human being to equality in the real sense of the term. I have found, however, that
Negroes are dull and sensitive. These opinions are based upon observation at Tuskegee
and in this schoolâ€”[the Lewis Institute]. Among my outstanding experiences
is a visit made to Tuskegee and meeting Booker T. Washington. The visit showed
great hope for the Negro. As a child I had no contact aside from living in the same
city with them.
</p>

<p>
It has always been considered unwise in the circles in which I moved for whites
and blacks to associate socially. I first became conscious of a race difference when a
very small childâ€”about three years of age.
</p>

<p>
Booker T. Washington, Cable, Dunbar, southerners and northerners who have
traveled in the South are probably best fitted to speak for Negroes. I do inquire of
both Negroes and whites for information. The only Negroes I know are working
people. Robert Jackson, alderman, and Ed. Green, lawyer. Booker T. Washington's
successor. I have read one Negro paper. It was insistent in a very fair way on
the political rights of the Negro. Good. Lynchings, lying, stealing, and the attacking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_463' name='Page_463' href='#Page_463'>463</a></span>
of little girls are the subject of discussion that most frequently lead to the Negro,
and these occur principally among men who have seen Negroes socially and women who
have hired them.
</p>

<p>
As a solution I would colonize them in Africa, and if they objected I would use
all peaceable means to force them to go.

Regarding the propositions: Their education should be increased and the demands
produced by education met.

Prejudice has its basis in race repulsion. Unless the isolation is African colonization,
there will be group prejudices.

Every man or group should demand and get complete justice.

I assume that it is a fact recognized by science that Negroes are so different from
whites that the two races cannot be amalgamated. This fact interposes a barrier to
social relationships. I share in the general dislike of Negroes as neighbors or traveling
companions on the street cars. The white race is responsible for the existence of the
Negro problem in America, and must submit patiently to the penalty for many years
to come. Lincoln's second inaugural is the best expression of this thought. The
Negro race is extraordinarily docile and easy to handle. If surrounded by good living
conditions and given a proper education they would be good citizens. The progress of
their race since slavery, considering their many handicaps, has been very creditable.
The prejudice against them is probably the most deep-seated of all American prejudices,
and must be reckoned with as one of the great factors in the problem.
</p>

<p>
In my opinion they are characterized by distinctly inferior mentality, deficient
moral sense, shiftlessness, good nature, and a happy disposition. I have in mind no
special facts, authorities or sources of information on which I base my opinions. I
do, however, recognize the bearing of Christianity on the problem, and find it impossible
to formulate a viewpoint which I can reconcile with the demands of Christianity.
</p>

<p>
We had a Negro family chauffeur some years ago who misconducted himself so
seriously as to have caused a very considerable increase in the family prejudice against
the race. If he had been an Irish man our prejudice against him would not have
extended to his race. As a child I had no contacts with Negroes, excepting one or two
fellow-pupils in public schools of whom I saw very little, and a few servants in the
neighborhood who were of the old-fashioned type, of pleasant memory.
</p>

<p>
I can recall no early prohibitions of association with Negroes. There were so
few in my neighborhood that they constituted no real problem. As to implied prohibitions,
I suppose I understood at a very early age the existing social difference,
although I remember no instances of this.
</p>

<p>
I cannot remember when I first became conscious of a racial difference, but I
assume it was at a very early age.
</p>

<p>
I do not know that I can cite any friends, acquaintances, favorite authors or
scholars well fitted to speak with authority on the question. Lincoln's views always
seemed true to me, while I have not been so favorably impressed by southern writers.
Every southerner I have ever met, no matter how reasonable on other subjects,
seemed to be incapable of looking at this question with an open mind. His confidence
that he knew all about the Negro and the problem seemed absolute, and therefore he
was not in position to learn. I occasionally inquire for information on this subject.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_464' name='Page_464' href='#Page_464'>464</a></span>
Naturally most of the men of whom I have made inquiries have been white, as I come
in contact with very few Negroes. I have, however, talked with Negroes who have
expressed their willingness to be segregated if the segregation was complete enough
to rid their district of all whites, and give them fair living conditions. I cannot say
that I know any Negroes, although there are a few with whom I have sufficient
acquaintance to talk with them occasionally. As to their leaders in Chicago, I have
assumed that their political leaders and their ministers were their leaders, the ministers
having a larger place of leadership than ministers among white people. I used
to come in contact occasionally with colored lawyers who were capable men, and I
believe leaders of their race, and I understand that there is a colored physician, whose
name I cannot recall, who is the real leader of the best Negroes in Chicago. Nationally
I could not name any since the death of Booker Washington, whom I very much
admired, excepting Du Bois whom I have heard speak, and with whose views I do
not sympathize. I do not remember ever reading a Negro periodical.
</p>

<p>
As I live on the South Side the subject of discussion most frequently leading to
the Negro is their encroachment on white residence districts. Two years ago my
church was given up to a colored congregation, and the church into which we were
transferred is seriously threatened by the same invasion. Property interests in a
large part of the South Side bring up the question, as does the unpleasantness of
meeting them on the street cars. I do not hear serious constructive discussion in
any circle. The invasion is deplored in all circles, social, business, church and
others.
</p>

<p>
I would not undertake to make any social adjustment on my present information,
except segregation of the Negroes in a part of the South Side, and this only if it had
the approval of their own leaders. I do not approve of "Jim Crow" street cars for
Chicago, although I would not insist on their abandonment in southern cities where
they are already used, and I would not favor any radical change if the better
Negroes obstinately objected.
</p>

<p>
I believe in educating Negroes, even though I am not sure to what it will lead. I
hope that as the race progresses the prejudice against it will be modified. Still this
prejudice is so very great that I think it would be foolish for the Negroes ever to seek
a high station through demands. Probably many of their demands should be granted,
but they will make greater progress by reckoning with the prejudice, and continuing
their present conciliatory attitude.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe that prejudice is based on fear. There is, of course, a well-founded
fear of many individual Negroes, but I do not believe that the white race
is conscious of any fear of the Negro race as such. I think the prejudice is based on the
relative inferiority of the Negro race.
</p>

<p>
As a general proposition this is doubtless true that isolation fosters prejudice.
As applied to Negroes, however, it is doubtful whether it would produce more conflict
than the present system. I would feel more hopeful of the overcoming of the
prejudice through more intimate contact with Negroes if the difference between Negroes
and white men were not so fundamental.
</p>

<p>
As an abstract proposition the despotism of a majority cannot be justified. I
would say it is a very bad doctrine to spread among a majority, but has in it a certain
amount of practical truth which the minority would do well to bear in mind.

<p>
Negroes do possess distinguishing traits of mentality and character. My opinions
are based upon my personal observation.
</p>

<p>
As I knew the Negro in the South he was inclined to be indolent, shiftless and
lacking in a high sense of honesty, though religious. His disposition is a happy one,
and often his good will is shown in many ways of gratitude and faithfulness. These
traits I have seen expressed in service as servants, in the cotton fields, in their homes,
and on town streets. In Chicago, when the Negro has long been a resident here,
having larger advantages in education and employment, I find the colored man
honest in business and other transactions, diligent at work, and inoffensive, but
firmly standing for his citizenship rights, and wanting to live peaceably. My Chicago
experience has been principally as a physician visiting in Negro homes.
</p>

<p>
When a boy I worked in the cotton fields with Negroes, and I attended some of
their religious meetings for the sake of amusement. It was a social law in the South
that we must not eat at the same table with Negroes, and we were not to sit with
colored people when riding on street cars or on trains. However, if a Negro was
driver of a horse and buggy, the most beautiful and refined woman might sit on the
same seat with the colored driver. White people visiting a colored church were given
seats to themselves, usually front seats. Colored children could not attend white
schools. At the age of six when I first saw Negroes, I became conscious of a race
difference.
</p>

<p>
I regard Rev. John R. Hayworth as fitted to advise on the question. I have
sought information from about twenty-five Negroes when in their midst as their
physician. I am acquainted with at least a dozen Negro families but can give the
names of only three. I consider Alderman De Priest, Mr. Lucas and Colonel Jackson
leading colored men; Dr. George Hall is also well known. I have never read a
Negro periodical.
</p>

<p>
In Chicago the subject of undesirable neighbors leads to the discussion of Negroes
in our neighborhood improvement clubs.
</p>

<p>
Believing that both black and white people prefer to live separately, I would make
agreeable provision for separate locations in which each might live and in so doing
abide by the wish of the majority and enforce its dictates.
</p>

<p>
The Negro should be given the advantage of education, culture and good employment.
We should expect to grant him better living conditions on account of such
advantages.
</p>

<p>
Prejudice against the Negro has its principal basis in not understanding him, as
well as fear and an inborn dislike for people of another race.
</p>

<p>
There never seemed to be any conflicts in the South because the whites and
blacks occupied separate parts of towns. Colored people in the South seem to prefer
to live in communities to themselves, because a bond of sympathy holds them together.
</p>

<p>
It is better for a minority to bear an injustice than for an overwhelming majority
to bear an injustice.

I know of no distinguishing traits.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_466' name='Page_466' href='#Page_466'>466</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My opinion is based largely on reading, as I never lived in the South. I had no
early contacts. There were few Negroes near, and none in my schools. As authorities
I would mention Professor Du Bois, Fannie B. Williams, Professor
Graham Taylor. I know an able colored woman, a member of the Chicago Woman's
Club and women who have worked in our home.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally I read a Negro periodical.
</p>

<p>
The discussion of lynchings and riots at home and church lead most frequently to
the Negro.
</p>

<p>
Our schools, trades and professions should be opened to Negroes and they be
permitted to take care of themselves. Let them follow their own bent so long as it
injures no one else.
</p>

<p>
Of course, when you educate Negroes you increase their demands. Grant their
demands.
</p>

<p>
Egotism and the jealousy that we whites are better are the basis of prejudice.
</p>

<p>
It is true that a minority has no right to expect complete justice from the majority,
if Negroes reason from experience; but the colored race probably has idealists who
hope for better future treatment.
</p>

The trouble is with the whites; selfishness and pride have caused the situation
and the regulation of the Negro according to faulty concepts of right will always fail.
The Stock Yards riots gave proof of equality in passion, cowardliness, and unfairness
between blacks and whites.
</p>

<p>
Negroes lag in evolution through hinderment. They may put reason above
emotion as they develop mentally, as do cultured whites, but a better evolution may
bring trained intuition from crude emotion.
</p>

<p>
My opinions are based upon short trips South, residence in Louisville and northern
contacts, plus general reading.
</p>

<p>
My only contacts are on the streets.
</p>

<p>
Children's talk and the term "Nigger" just called my attention to a race difference.
</p>

<p>
I know a few highly educated Negro pastors. I never read Negro papers. The
subject of interracial marriage leads to the discussion of the Negro.
</p>

<p>
As a solution they should be distributed without boundaries, among whites, as to
residence, occupation and society. They would not object; it is what they fight forâ€”equality.
</p>

<p>
Negro faults are the result of retarded mental growth. Why further retard them?
The problem ceases to be as their mental level rises. Prejudice is the result of selfishness
in whites. Your third proposition is absolutely true.

Injustice to the minority by the majority is unconstitutional, un-Christian and
unwise.

My opinion is that the Negro is entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
as well as the white. The very fact that his skin is differently colored than mine
is no reason why he should not be free to develop himself mentally, morally, and physically
the same as I do. Observation is basis of my opinion. No contacts or warnings
as a child. No friends particularly familiar with question.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_467' name='Page_467' href='#Page_467'>467</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I have given this matter some little consideration, and have discussed it with
some Negroes as well as many white men. It is my opinion that the consensus of
opinion among Negroes to whom I have talked is that they have no particular desire
to mix socially with the white man, but that they do feel they should be given opportunity
for development along those lines for which they are best fitted. I am not
acquainted particularly with any of the leaders in this movement anywhere.
</p>

<p>
I read no Negro periodical. Racial equality is the subject that leads to the Negro.
</p>

<p>
In all circles where general subjects are usually discussed the question of the
Negro arises.
</p>

<p>
Until the white man is ready to give the Negro a square deal, I would suggest
that he be segregated, and given every opportunity for development possible under
such segregation. If they objected I would insist upon majority rule.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is gained by keeping the Negro ignorant, any more than would be gained
by keeping the white man ignorant. Education of all of our races will bring about
the world's salvation.
</p>

<p>
Prejudice among white women has its basis in fear but not particularly among
men. This is partly due to the publicity given to all acts against women by Negroes,
in my judgment.
</p>

<p>
The history of the world has proved that most of the races on earth tend to group
themselves, which is the natural thing, because of the community of interest.
</p>

<p>
Until the Golden Rule is accepted unanimously majority rule will continue to
be the human law and under our present world political arrangements, it seems to
be about as fair as any arrangement could be.

The Negro seems to me to be evolutionally handicapped, but possesses the
qualities of childrenâ€”imitativeness, affection, loyalty, receptiveness, lack of responsibility,
carelessness, improvidence. They also seem to me to lack racial pride, for
which their history in this country may well account. There are fine Negroes and
those who are as worthless as "poor white trash." To judge them all by either the
best or the worst would be manifestly unfair. I feel that they have, as a race, never
had a fair chance for their finest development.
</p>

<p>
I have lived among them and practiced medicine in their families for ten years.
</p>

<p>
The most tender, loving service, beyond monetary recompense, of one Negro
woman who worked in my family for ten years. Her intimate, gentle, faithful
services to members of my family in health and sickness will always endear her to
us and make us more conscious of the possibilities of members of that race.
</p>

<p>
The community in which I was raised had so few Negroes that there was no occasion
for contacts or prohibitions to association. I suppose as a boy I first became
conscious of race difference.
</p>

<p>
I have discussed this question with intelligent Negroes, have heard some fine
sermons by Negro preachers, and am somewhat familiar with the writings of Booker T.
Washington and Du Bois.
</p>

<p>
I do not read their periodicals.
</p>

<p>
Mention of the servant cited in a foregoing question, newspaper accounts of
lynchings, house-bombings most frequently lead to discussion of Negroes among our
personal friends.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_468' name='Page_468' href='#Page_468'>468</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I feel that Negroes would be happier if segregated in neighborhoods which allowed
contact with the dominant race. I feel that they are as unhappy to be isolated among
whites as the whites would be to be isolated among Negroes. I feel they should have
the right to live under decent conditions, with those things which make life livable
and enjoyable. Probably part of my unwillingness to have them for neighbors lies
in the fear of undesirable neighbors (bad citizens), in the fear of property depreciation
which would follow, and because of the lack of interests in common that make for
neighborly intercourse. I suppose I am as inconsistent as others in this, for in my
heart I have no prejudice of which I am aware, yet I believe I am infected with the
universal indefinite prejudice, if I could but analyze it thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
Their education should not be curtailed, but enlarged. Their demands should
be granted if not incompatible with the common good.
</p>

<p>
It is probably true that prejudice is based on fear, a result of the abuse of female
slaves by the whites in slavery time, and the resultant desire on the part of a few
Negroes engendered during the reconstruction period by the carpet-baggers, to have
social equality. I have discussed this subject of "social equality" with intelligent,
fine Negroes, and believe they meant what they said when they assured me that
among decent Negroes there is no more desire for this than there is among the white
people. I feel that it is a bugaboo, useful in increasing fear and prejudice against
the Negro.
</p>

<p>
By segregation, I did not mean isolation, but the natural grouping together of
Negroes under wholesome conditions, but which permitted their contact through
employment, through meetings for the common good, with the dominant race.
</p>

<p>
Even a minority has the right to expect and demand justice in opportunity
to develop industrial, social and spiritual growth. I recognize that education of
both whites and blacks is necessary to overcome fear and prejudice and make this
possible.

My opinion, which is still open to conviction, is that the Negro race overlaps
the white race throughout the bulk of the frequency curves of distribution of
intelligence of the two races; but the average of the Negro race is probably lower
than that of the white race, and among the extreme varieties the Negroes probably
go lower and the whites higher than the similar varieties of the other race. This
refers to distribution of inherent capacity. But I believe that many of them are
modifiable and differ only in their average distribution from similar qualities in whites.
Also that certain distinguishing traits may be so adjusted to the circumstances under
which Negroes are educated and employed as to be distinctly advantageous, both to
themselves and to society.
</p>

<p>
Aside from my conversation with southerners, I have made a special study of the
Negro problem in connection with my undergraduate work, and again at the University
of Pennsylvania. I am familiar with a number of worth-while sources which
can be listed on request. I lived for four winters in St. Louis, where I saw a great
many Negroes, but knew none. Some excitement was caused there by an instructor
inviting a mulatto school principal to address our sociology class. There was no
protest here in Evanston. I also passed through the South, and stopped twice at
New Orleans.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_469' name='Page_469' href='#Page_469'>469</a></span>

<p>
As a child in Portland, Oregon, I had two Negro nurses. At the age of perhaps
seven or eight years, one of my nurses returned for a visit, and I was teased by companions
for kissing her. That was my first consciousness of a racial difference.
</p>

<p>
My authorities and sources of importance are the N.A.A.C.P., Urban League,
the Race Relations Commission, and certain Negroes. I might also mention the two
Spingarns and Mr. Roger Baldwin. I know C. S. Johnson, T. Arnold Hill and the
colored members of the Commission, together with the union leaders whom I heard.
W. E. B. Du Bois, Haynes, Dr. Roman, J. W. Johnson, T. A. Hill, I regard as leaders
among the Negroes.
</p>

<p>
I read the <i>Crisis</i>, and occasional newspapers. The <i>Crisis</i> is good except the
fiction; the newspapers are rather poor.
</p>

<p>
Race relations, mob action, venereal disease, and housing questions lead to discussion
of the Negro.
</p>

<p>
As a solution I suggest equal facilities, spontaneous segregation, spontaneous
co-operation in common interest, education in matters of sex. In this program there
would be no compulsion involvedâ€”unless possibly upon the whites.
</p>

<p>
Their education should be modified and their demands granted so far as they can
be harmonized with the general good.
</p>

<p>
The main question involved in prejudice seems to me whether it is an interest or
an instinct. If it is an interest then changes in social organization may with comparative
ease abate the fear and the prejudice. If it is an instinct then we can only
deal with it by repression and sublimation of a more deeply psychological character.
</p>

<p>
I question whether the prejudice is greater the greater the isolation. The word
isolation should be analyzed into physical or economic on the one hand, and psychological
on the other.
</p>

<p>
Plato asked, "What is justice?" The answer can never be final, and one's
concept of it is usually colored by interest. A sociological definition of justice is in
terms of harmony or harmonization of interests. Complete harmony never does
exist, else we should have no thought and no progress, but harmonization of interests
can be a continuous process, and is not irreconcilable with the existence of minorities
and majorities.

I have formed no definite opinions about Negroes. I am inclined to the opinion
that generally the balance is found on the side of the white races. In general I believe
they possess distinguishing traits of mentality and character. I find it very difficult,
however, to define my opinion regarding this.
</p>

<p>
When I was in high school in Petersburg, Illinois, from 1895 to 1898, the school
had an attendance of about forty. There were two Negroes, a boy and a girl. The
boy's name was John Gaddie. I have the impression now that they both acted as
though they were out of place. I found John a likeable boy. I think all of the members
of the school liked him. I particularly liked him, so paid considerable attention
to him, to which John reacted in a decided manner. He never forgot it. I do not
like to shake hands with Negroes. I avoid it whenever I can, but I never had any
hesitancy in shaking hands with John. After finishing school, I went to college and
John went to work. His work was some sort of manual labor. From time to time
when I went back to Petersburg I saw John, always spoke to him, shook hands with
him and talked to him. John appreciated this very much and acted as though he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_470' name='Page_470' href='#Page_470'>470</a></span>
regarded it a condescension on my part. I am not aware that I feel toward any
other Negro as I feel toward John Gaddie.
</p>

<p>
I was first conscious of a racial difference when I first knew the Negro, which was
when I was about fifteen years of age. In the small town of Petersburg (about 3,000
inhabitants) the Negroes there, as here in Chicago, lived in a segregated district.
There were no clashes between the Negro and the whites but the racial difference was
obvious enough.
</p>

<p>
I know very few Negroes. I know too little to be in a position to consider anyone
as a leader among the colored people in Chicago or the United States. I never read a
Negro periodical. The subjects most frequently leading to the discussion of the
Negro are riots, housing problems, certain industrial problems, and, here in Chicago,
politics.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the Negroes obstinately objected quite logically would not interfere
with making any adjustment which seemed "wise." The social adjustment
which seemed "wise" would have to be based on the possibility of objection on the
part of the Negro. If the leaders were obstinate, some other solution would have to
be worked out, but if the leaders saw that it was wise and for the best interest of the
masses I would insist that the plan be tried out.
</p>

<p>
I do not comprehend what is meant by "demand." It may mean ambition for
social standing in the sense of intermingling with the whites. It may mean other
things. No matter what it means, I am not impressed, if the statement is true, that
it is any reason for not educating the Negro. I am not impressed that it becomes
necessary either to curtail or modify the Negro's education or to grant their demands
whatever they may be.
</p>

<p>
I do not think it true that prejudice has its basis in fear.
</p>

<p>
So far as I am familiar with it there is naturally a very high degree of segregation
of the Negro as to living quarters everywhere. I am not aware that the segregation
which we now find of habitation brings about the development of special group prejudices.
Undoubtedly, if there are or were such prejudices they would form the background
of conflicts. It doesn't seem to me to follow that the greater the isolation the
greater the prejudice.
</p>

<p>
There never is complete justice; but if a minority may not expect justice at the
hands of an overwhelming majority it can expect no justice at all. The justice, if it
comes at all, will be at the hands of an overwhelming majority. Theoretically, in this
country all are entitled to justice. I know no reason why this should not be true in
a practical sense. Furthermore, I see no reason why a minority may not only expect
but demand, at the hands of an overwhelming majority, justice. It seems to me that
if the overwhelming majority hoped to prosper, it would see to it that justice was dispensed
to the minority. I do not find myself ready to place the Negro on an equal
basis with the white in every respect, that is, socially and otherwise. I do not regard
the failure to so place the Negroes as injustice to them.

In general, I like the Negro, but I lament his presence in this country in large
numbers. I have never heard a solution of the Negro problem. Their distinguishing
traits are ignorance, good nature, mental weakness, and physical strength.
</p>

<p>
I have never heard of good arguments for extensive isolation.

<p>
I have a strong prejudice, but it is undefined. For instance, the hair of Negroes
always holds a peculiar fascination, but under no consideration could I touch it, but
there was always a great curiosity about it. I was undecided whether or not I should
shake hands or in any way touch a colored skin, but I am quite sure I would never
do it from choice. The everyday contacts on street cars are the only personal experiences
I have had. The fascination of watching them is constant.
</p>

<p>
When I was about two years old a family moved into the village bringing with
them an old colored nurse. She was too old to work, and my childish remembrance
is that she always sat in the corner near the fireplace with a pipe in her mouth. I
did not know that the Negro could do anything else.
</p>

<p>
When I was about five years old a Negro came to the village and opened a barber
shop. I remember my father telling mother about the Negro and how he took the
three small children down to see "Snowball" as a matter of curiosity. My reaction
was that the Negro was not a person such as I was accustomed to seeing, although
there was no feeling of classing him as an animal.
</p>

<p>
The third contact came when I was half-grown. My father was prominent in
politics and on election day the table was kept set so that anyone sent from the polls
could have a meal. By some chance a Negro was sent and ate. After he had gone
I remember seeing my mother take the plate and other dishes out in the yard and
scour them with brick dust, evidently with an idea that something had rubbed off.
</p>

<p>
My information is largely taken from the books of Booker T. Washington.
I admired Dunbar's poems when they were current in the newspapers and magazines.
I have not seen any of them for many years but remember vividly, "When the Bread
Won't Raise." I was naturally familiar with <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, both as a book and
a play in Civil War days. I do not consciously seek for information on the subject
of Negroes and do not personally know any Negroes. Outside of the names which
appear in the press I do not know of any Negro leaders and could not be sure of
correct information as to those who are well known.
</p>

<p>
I have never seen a Negro periodical and have so rarely heard Negroes discussed
that no conclusions can be given. The Negro is rarely a topic of conversation
in my circle.
</p>

<p>
As a solution they might be nationalized if possible, somewhere and somehow,
like the Japs. Liberia is a failure largely because of white leadership and policy.
Some portion of the earth should be set aside where the Negroes can be a nation,
perhaps in Africa. They have a right to work out their own problems in their own ways.
</p>

<p>
All Negroes should be educated as highly as possible. They have a right to it
because they are Americans. If demands follow this education, it is right they should
be granted.
</p>

<p>
There is no personal fear of Negroes as a basis of my prejudice.
</p>

<p>
I agree with the third proposition as to isolation.
</p>

<p>
Majority's injustice to minority is always true in politics, religion, everyday
dealings. Is not peculiar to relations between white and colored.
</p>

<p>
My views are more impressions than opinions. I have a distinct aversion to close
association with Negroes generally. On the other hand I have a distinct liking for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_472' name='Page_472' href='#Page_472'>472</a></span>
particular Negroes whom I have been thrown with. Aside from the more educated
ones, they seem to me to be of a sluggish mentality and of somewhat low moral
character. They seem to have more of the animal in them. I am not sure that this
is not an impression rather than an opinion.
</p>

<p>
I have no basis for my views except my own experience and what I have read in
papers and periodicals.
</p>

<p>
I had two Negro classmates in college; I saw a good deal of Negroes as a boy;
and I have known Negroes, some well educated, since I came to Chicago from the
law school.
</p>

<p>
Although my contacts were largely casual, I particularly remember one very old
Negro man whom I regarded as a sort of patriarch and of whom I was a little bit
afraid. Then I recall vividly my impression of the filth and sordidness of "darky-town"
in the small city in which I lived as a boy. I was never forbidden, so far as I
can remember, to associate with Negroes. In public school there was no separation
of the races. As a small boy, it seems to me my playmates in school were partly
Negroes. Of course the Negroes, as is usual, lived in a separate part of the city.
I should say that this seemed to me then to be a natural and necessary arrangement.
Negroes were black and we were white. That was about all there was to it.
</p>

<p>
Very early I became race conscious, I should say along about the fourth or fifth
grade in school, perhaps even before.
</p>

<p>
I regard as authorities on the question teachers or officers of Fisk University,
Tuskegee Institute, those who have to do with criminals; employers of Negroes;
persons who have dealt with Negroes as a class as well as individually. Booker T.
Washington's writings should be an authority.
</p>

<p>
I have made very few inquiries for information. I know few Negroes in Chicago.
Those that I do know are of the better educated type. Some of them, I think, have
been at Fisk University. I do not know the leaders in the city, nor do I know the
leaders in the country; but I should say they are the heads of the great Negro universities
and colleges, like Fisk, Tuskegee, Lincoln Institute. Booker Washington
was, of course, a leader. I do not know who his successors are.
</p>

<p>
So far as I know, I have seen only one Negro periodical, some years ago. The
article I read in it I happened to be interested in because I was dealing with the subject
of it, and it was undoubtedly a prejudiced article founded on misinformation and
a rather wilful disregard of facts. As I recall the paper as a whole its main motive and
purpose was an apparent hatred of the white race. I realize that this is not enough
to base an opinion on.
</p>

<p>
The discussion of labor, politics, especially questions connected with southern
politics, almost any question relating to the South, education, home missions, living
conditions, the servant problem, crime, most frequently lead to the Negro.
</p>

<p>
It would hardly be feasible to send Negroes out of the country as a whole; they are
needed in the industrial world, and it would not be a Christian act to deport them.
Nor does it seem right or practicable or just to segregate them entirely. They need
education and the help that comes from association with those who are further along
in the polite amenities. On the other hand, unless they are somewhat segregated
racial troubles are sure to arise when a Negro tries to settle, say, in the same block with
upper class whites. I am not sure that it might not be a good plan if one or two of
the southern states could be turned over to the Negroes, but if this is done they should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_473' name='Page_473' href='#Page_473'>473</a></span>
be allowed to govern themselves and should be protected from exploitation from unscrupulous
whites.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that race prejudice is not based principally on fear, but rather on a
natural aversion or shrinking from a man of another color. It is almost as elemental
as fear. We fear any uneducated, ignorant and brutal man, whether he be white,
red, black or yellow. We have an aversion, as I have said, to close association with
any man of another color, even though he be educated. I do not know whether this
aversion is curable by any method or not.
</p>

<p>
I am inclined to agree with the third proposition, and I suppose the fourth proposition
is regrettably true.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The outstanding feature in the answers to the queries: "Have you formed
definite opinions about Negroes?" and "Do Negroes, in your opinion, possess
distinguishing traits of mentality or character?" is the great variation in
opinions. As a race they are "shiftless," "childish," "docile," "evolutionarily
handicapped," "undependable," "some of them good," "they have as a
mass a lower level of inherent capacity," "disliked in the mass," "liked as
individuals," "entitled to the same leniency and consideration as whites,"
"entitled to the same rights as whites," "lacking in racial pride," "loyal,"
"imitative," "affectionate," "improvident."
</p>

<p>
The feelings toward Negroes are as varied. There is aversion to close
association, a distinct dislike, a desire that Negroes should have equal rights
and privileges, a desire that they should have the same rights, a feeling that
Negroes have been mistreated and exploited, a feeling that selfishness and pride
of white persons have caused the present racial situation, and a conviction that
present behavior toward the Negro is faulty and wrong. Lincoln is twice
mentioned but with different meanings. The trend of sentiment, while unfavorable
toward Negroes, maintains some sort of ideal. Although childish,
they "must be trained," "although we dislike their presence, we must submit
to our penalty for years to come," etc. Some are not sure of their opinions.
Some call them impressions or regret a lack of knowledge. A general summing
up would show a desire to be fair in spite of unfavorable opinions.
</p>

<p>
The questions regarding the disposition they would make of Negroes if
they could entirely control the situation were put to get views uninfluenced by
considerations of present practicability. The play of circumstances, opinion,
ethical considerations, and difficulties were excluded from consideration. The
trend of replies was toward segregation, even to the extent of colonization in
Africa. There were curious anomalies, like segregation without Jim Crow
and segregation for the Negro's own happiness. Others would distribute them
without boundaries throughout the social system. When segregation is generally
mentioned it is conditioned on the consent of Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Interesting answers are made on propositions (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), and (<i>d</i>), covering
education, prejudice, isolation, and justice. In spite of unforeseen danger, it
is pretty generally agreed that Negroes should be educated, even though their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_474' name='Page_474' href='#Page_474'>474</a></span>
demands are thus increased. There is less agreement on granting demands.
The analysis of prejudice brought a wide variety of opinions. Repulsion,
natural aversion, social equality and the sex complex, selfishness of whites,
egotism and inborn dislike, as well as fear, are accredited as forming the basis
of prejudice.
</p>

<p>
The problem of isolation was essentially a problem of segregation. Strange
to say, although the trend of some was toward isolation, there was a majority
belief that isolation would increase conflict and friction. The ethical problem
developed in general the opinion that there does exist a disparity between what
is and what should be.
</p>

<p>
The unwisdom of an unjust course of social conduct is recognized, but is
for the most part held to be warranted by the peculiar difficulty of present relations.
Here, probably as nowhere else, the problem was compared with other
general problems not involving race.
</p>

<p>
The experiences on which opinions are based divide into definite classes:
</p>

<p>
1. Experiences in the South.
</p>

<p>
2. Experiences with individual Negro servants.
</p>

<p>
3. Experiences with individual Negroes of intelligence.
</p>

<p>
4. General observation.
</p>

<p>
The actual basis of opinions as stated by the persons themselves provides
an interesting question.
</p>

<p>
The question concerning early childhood experiences was put to draw out,
if possible, impressions unconsciously insinuated or consciously obtained but
perhaps discounted and forgotten through subsequent years of intermittent
relations. It was successful in bringing to light incidents of striking significance.
The answers, indeed, show striking elements in the heritage of racial
consciousness. Impressions gained in early life require many facts to unsettle
or remove.
</p>

<p>
Most important in considering the trustworthiness of information sources
are the replies to the question: "Whom of your friends, acquaintances, favorite
authors, scholars, etc., do you regard best fitted to speak with authority on the
question?" There are mentioned seven Negroes and ten white persons. Of
the four local Negroes mentioned, two might be regarded as well informed;
one has been out of public life for fifteen years, and the other, although by no
means an authority, probably could provide interesting information. Of the
Negro national figures, Washington, Du Bois, and Dunbar are mentioned,
Washington three times, Dunbar and Du Bois once. Booker T. Washington
died in 1915. Paul Laurence Dunbar, the poet, died in 1906. Practically all
of the white persons mentioned have been at some time connected with movements
to improve conditions among Negroes. George W. Cable wrote for
the most part stories of the Creole South.
</p>

<p>
It is strange, though, that in answering the question, "Who are the Negro
leaders?" so many gave the names of politicians, who are not the real leaders
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_475' name='Page_475' href='#Page_475'>475</a></span>
of Negroes. About half of those who answered had never read a Negro
periodical, and half of those who had read them considered their influence
pernicious.
</p>

<h4>
V. PUBLIC OPINION AS EXPRESSED BY NEGROES
</h4>

<p>
The practice of "keeping the Negro in his place" or any modification of it
in northern communities has isolated Negroes from all other members of the
community. Though in the midst of an advanced social system and surrounded
by cultural influences, they have hardly been more than exposed to
them. Of full and free participation they know little. The pressure of the
dominant white group in practically every ordinary experience has kept the
attention and interests of Negroes centered upon themselves, and made them
race conscious. Their thinking on general questions is controlled by their
race interests. The opinions of Negroes, therefore, are in large measure a
negative product.
</p>

<p>
It is probably for this reason that most of their expressions of opinion take
the form of protest. This same enforced self-interest warps these opinions,
giving exaggerated values to the unconsidered views of the larger group, increasing
sensitiveness to slights, and keeping Negroes forever on the defensive.
Extreme expressions, unintelligible to those outside the Negro group, are a
natural result of this isolation. The processes of thought by which these opinions
are reached are, by virtue of this very isolation, concealed from outsiders.
Negroes by their words alone may often be judged as radical, pernicious, or
fanatic. Without the background of their experiences it is no more possible
for their views to be completely understood than for Negroes to understand
the confessed prejudices of white persons, or even their ordinary feelings toward
Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Negroes know more of the habits of action and thought of the white group
than white people know of similar habits in the Negro group. For Negroes
read the whites' books and papers, hear them talk, and sometimes see them in
the intimacy of their homes. But this one-sided and partial understanding
serves only to make the behavior of the whites more keenly felt. Until these
differences, long held as taboo, are thoroughly understood and calmly faced,
there is small chance of satisfactory relations.
</p>

<p>
The opinions of Negroes on this question are as various as the white opinions
of the Negro. Their response may reflect, the sentiment of the larger
group; it may take a conciliatory turn, or, it may be exclusively self-centered
in disregard, if indeed not in defiance, of the white group. The rapid growth
of the Garvey movement<a name='FA_80' id='FA_80' href='#FN_80' class='fnanchor'>[80]</a> is a good example of this last type of opinion. There
is harmony of opinion on ultimates, but on programs, processes, and methods
there are differences among Negroes that reach the intensity of abusive conflicts.
</p>

<p>
No Negro is willing to admit that he belongs to a different and lower species,
or that his race is constitutionally weak in character. All Negroes hope for an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_476' name='Page_476' href='#Page_476'>476</a></span>
adjustment by virtue of which they will be freely granted the privileges of
ordinary citizens. They are conscious, however, of an opposition in the traditions
of the country and actually meet it daily. Conflict arises from opinions
as to methods of combating and overcoming the opposition with the greatest
gain and smallest loss to themselves.
</p>

<p>
Thus we come to hear of different schools of thought among Negroes.
Booker T. Washington is contrasted with W. E. B. Du Bois, and Du Bois is
contrasted with Owen, Peyton, and Colson, and they, in turn are contrasted
with Garvey. Among individual Negroes opinion is determined by experience
as well as tradition. The Negro house-servant does not feel toward white
persons as does a Negro common laborer. The independent professional man
holds an opinion essentially different from the social worker. Yet they are all
governed by those trends of sentiment protective of the Negro group, and in
crises either act upon them or suffer the group's censure.
</p>

<p>
An instance of the strength of Negro group opinion appeared in a tragic
by-product of the Chicago riot. A Negro prominent in local political and social
circles was sought out as a leader, and asked for an interview by a reporter of
the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> during the riot. In the published interview he was
reported as saying: "This is a white man's country, and Negroes had better
behave or they will get what rights they have taken away." This aroused
a solid Negro sentiment against him; his life was threatened; for several
weeks he had to have police protection; he was finally ostracized; and in less
than a year he died. His friends asserted that he was slanderously misquoted,
and that his death was due largely to the resulting criticism.
</p>

<p>
The more balanced opinions may be found among Negroes who have
developed a defensive philosophy. Race pride and racial solidarity have sprung
from this necessity. The term radical is used to characterize Negroes whose
views and preachments are in advocacy of changes which to the general white
public appear undesirable. It will be observed that most of the so-called
radicals are southern Negroes now living in the North. They know by experience
the meaning of oppression. Contrasts with them are sharper and the
desire for change is more insistent, because they can appreciate differences.
</p>

<p>
Frequently this "radicalism" is no more than a matter of interpretation by
white persons and possibly an oversuspicion. For example, Attorney-General
A. Mitchell Palmer, in his report on the investigations of his department,
referred to the bitter protests of Negro publications against lynching and disfranchisement
as radical and incendiary documents. This report is headed,
"Radicalism and Sedition among the Negroes as Reflected in Their Publications."
It reads in part as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There can no longer be any question of a well-concerted movement among a
certain class of Negro leaders of thought and action to constitute themselves a determined
and persistent source of a radical opposition to the government, and to the
established rule of law and order.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_477' name='Page_477' href='#Page_477'>477</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Among the more salient points to be noted in the present attitude of the Negro
leaders are, first, the ill-governed reaction toward race rioting; second, the threat of
retaliatory measures in connection with lynching; third, the more openly expressed
demand for social equality, in which demand the sex problem is not infrequently
included; fourth, the identification of the Negro with such radical organizations as
the I.W.W. and an outspoken advocacy of the Bolsheviki or Soviet doctrines; fifth,
the political stand assumed toward the present federal administration, the South in
general, and incidentally, toward the peace treaty and the League of Nations. Underlying
these more salient viewpoints is the increasingly emphasized feeling of a race
consciousness in many of these publications always antagonistic to the white race and
openly, defiantly assertive of its own equality and even superiority. When it is borne
in mind that this boast finds its most frequent expression in the pages of those journals
whose editors are men of education, and in at least one instance, by men holding
degrees conferred by Harvard University, it may be seen that the boast is not to be
dismissed lightly as the ignorant vaporing of untrained minds. Neither is the influence
of the Negro press in general to be reckoned with lightly. The <i>Negro World</i>
for October 18, 1919, states that "there are a dozen Negro papers with a circulation
of over 20,000, and scores with smaller circulation. There are half a dozen magazines
with a large circulation and other magazines with a smaller circulation, and there are
easily over fifty writers who can write interesting editorials and special articles, written
in fine, pure English, with a background of scholarship behind them." Notwithstanding
the clumsiness of expression of this particular assertion, the claim is not an
idle one. It may be added that in several instances the Negro magazines are expensive
in manufacture, being on coated paper throughout, well-printed, and giving evidence
of the possession of ample funds.
</p>

<p>
In all the discussions of the recent race riots there is reflected the note of pride
that the Negro has found himself, that he has "fought back," that never again will
he tamely submit to violence or intimidation. The sense of oppression finds increasingly
bitter expression. Defiance and insolently race-centered condemnation of the
white race is to be met with in every issue of the more radical publications, and this
one in moderateness of denunciation carries its own threat. The Negro is "seeing
red," and it is the prime object of the leading publications to induce a like quality of
vision upon the part of their readers. A few of them deny this, notwithstanding the
evidence of their work. Others of them openly admit the fact. The number of
restrained and conservative publications is relatively negligible, and even some of
these ... have indulged in most intemperate utterance, though it would be unfair
not to state that certain papersâ€”I can think of no magazinesâ€”maintain an attitude
of well-balanced sanity....
</p>

<p>
The <i>Messenger</i> for October is significant for one thing above all others. In it for
the first time a Negro publication comes out openly for sex equality.<a name='FA_81' id='FA_81' href='#FN_81' class='fnanchor'>[81]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is the sentiment briefly sketched in the foregoing pages that summons
attention. What are Negroes actually thinking? How are they being affected
by what the general public is thinking? What do they want? Against what
are their protests directed? What kinds of group sentiments are being developed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_478' name='Page_478' href='#Page_478'>478</a></span>
and how significant are they as to subsequent relations between the
two groups?
</p>

<p>
This report merely sets out examples of those views in the hope of showing
the beliefs that control the conduct of Negroes in Chicago.
</p>

<h5>
1. RACE PROBLEMS
</h5>

<p>
<i>Criticism of Negro leaders.</i>â€”A Negro attorney said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have read numerous articles written by prominent colored men on the subject
of Negroes moving North, and I have heard many of them speak. But few of them,
in my opinion, will bear rigid criticism. They are wanting in genuine expression of
true conditions. Those writers and orators who have some personal motive for their
expression do not necessarily speak with absolute frankness.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A Negro worker said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Our leaders are not interested enough in the welfare of the race. As soon as
they reach some little place of fame they try to get off to themselves.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Contacts as basis for respect.</i>â€”A Negro professional man said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
When in school in Oberlin my professor in debating and oratory was so prejudiced
that he would not let the other colored boy and me be on teams together. We asked
him repeatedly, but he always refused. We decided to work on a debate for all there
was in it and compel him to recognize the fact that we could measure up to the other
members of the class. When we finished he praised our work in the highest terms.
After that he began to take an interest in me and finally told me that he did not know
anything about Negroes and just felt that there was nothing worth while in them.
He tried to persuade me to teach, and when I left he gave me one of the best letters
of recommendation that I have ever seen. That shows what contact can do.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Not a race problem.</i>â€”A Negro business man said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There is no race problem; if the white people would only do as they would be
done by we would not have need of commissions to better conditions. This won't
be done, but an easier plan is to enforce the law. The laws are good enough but they
are not enforced. Riots grow out of hate, jealousy, envy, and prejudice. When a
man becomes a contented citizen there will be little chance of causing him to fight
anyone. Give us those things that are due usâ€”law, protection, and equal rightsâ€”then
we will become contented citizens.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>For better race relations in Chicago.</i>â€”A Negro alderman said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. Pass a vagrancy law that will take the idle, shiftless and intolerant hoodlum
off the streets. Put the burden of proof on the one so arrested.
</p>

<p>
2. Close all vicious poolrooms and dens of vice, and permit no boy under nineteen
years of age to enter poolrooms.
</p>

<p>
3. Forbid loitering on the street corners, especially transfer points.
</p>

<p>
4. Prohibit vicious and race-antagonizing campaign speeches on the streets of
the city and in public halls. Races must not be arrayed against each other.
</p>

<p>
5. Make more rigid the habeas corpus act, tighten up on the parole and probation
laws and enforcement of the truancy law.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_479' name='Page_479' href='#Page_479'>479</a></span>
</p>

<p>
6. Stop the newspapers from referring to the territory occupied by the colored
people as the "Black Belt."
</p>

<p>
7. Inciting and inflammatory headlines in the newspapers must be stopped.
</p>

<p>
8. Open the gates of employment to all races in our public utilities, such as
street-car and elevated-road service, Chicago Telephone Co. exchanges, Peoples
Gas Light &amp; Coke Co., and the Commonwealth Edison Co.
</p>

<p>
9. Better housing for the colored people and improvement of the district in
which a vast majority of them reside by turning certain streets into boulevards,
building small parks and playgrounds, and let the city or South Park Commissioners
build a bathing-beach equal to any other for the benefit and comfort of all races along
the water front, between Twenty-ninth and Thirty-ninth streets. This without
lines or thought of segregation and for the benefit of a neglected part of our tax-paying
community.
</p>

<p>
10. Apprehend and convict the bomb throwers by placing in command of our
police-stations officers who will do their duty and place patrolmen on duty who will
not sympathize with this lawless element of our citizenry. Greater still, insist that
the state's attorney do his full duty in prosecuting the people who are responsible
for inciting these criminal acts.
</p>

<p>
11. Safeguard the rights of all races in our public parks and on the public highways.
</p>

<p>
12. Give us a man's chance in the field of labor, and we will prove that we are
no burden to any other race of people.
</p>
</div>

<h5>
2. THE EMOTIONAL BACKGROUND

<i>An old settler.</i>â€”The sentiment presented below is probably the unpolished
feeling of a Negro who was born in Chicago before the fire of 1871, and has
lived here since. His grandfather owned the property where the post-office
now stands. He was at one time a member of the Central Y.M.C.A. (white).
For two and a half years he was assistant bookkeeper in a white bank in Memphis,
Tennessee. He said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Prejudice has been on the increase in Chicago since 1893. Southerners came to
the World's Exposition and many of them remained. They brought their prejudices
with them. On the cars they would order colored people to get up and give their
seats to them. This resulted in fights, and when the cases were taken to court colored
people won as many cases as whites. I took my grandmother to the fair and on the
street car I had an altercation with a white southerner who called her "Auntie."
He tried to hit me, and I got out my gun to shoot him. A Columbian guard and
detective grabbed me. When the case was called I was discharged.
</p>

<p>
Hyde Park is a nest of prejudice. These southerners moved out there. Southern
clubs are established throughout the country. They get northernized and want
straight-haired mulatto maids for their mistresses and call them typists. The southern
white boys get jobs on newspapers in the North and work for nothing in order that
they may write articles and editorials against Negroes and spread the doctrine of
the South.
</p>

<p>
A good many years ago colored people lived in good homes and the Irish lived in
shanties. They used to call them "flannel mouth," "mick," and "shanty Irish."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_480' name='Page_480' href='#Page_480'>480</a></span>
It used to be that only colored men of light complexion could secure jobs as porters
on certain railroads. In 1908 the Archbishop of the Diocese of the Catholic Church
issued an edict that white communicants should not worship at the Thirty-sixth and
Dearborn streets church. The whites still go there, however. The very fact that the
G.A.R. invited the Confederate veterans to march in the same parade on Memorial
Day goes to show that prejudice against Negroes is increasing. They are combining.
These southern societies in Chicago which foster race prejudice should be exposed.

<p>
<i>Abyssinians.</i>â€”During the summer of 1920 a group of self-styled "Abyssinians,"
in a spectacular demonstration,<a name='FA_82' id='FA_82' href='#FN_82' class='fnanchor'>[82]</a> killed two white men and seriously
wounded two Negroes, one of whom was a policeman. Neither whites nor
Negroes could give any further explanation of the affair than that it was an
ignorant outburst of fanatics. Although the demonstration was announced
as part of a membership drive in a "Back to Africa Movement," there was a
definite racial sentiment in the appeals to unlettered Negroes. This sentiment
was calculated to solidify the fanatic group, while, at the same time, by its
anti-social dogma, it placed this group in opposition to the safety and well-being
of the community. Meetings and speeches and anti-racial dogma,
founded upon unusual interpretations of the Bible, gave their sentiments a religious
fervor and a racial aim. Thus these sentiments grew, uncorrected by
outsiders, and finally expressed themselves in criminal but significant conduct.
The significance of these sentiments is apparent in the attitude of a sympathizer
with the movement, expressed to one of the Commission's investigators several
weeks before the outbreak made the movement unpopular. He is a shopkeeper,
and most of his trade is among Negroes. His business with whites is wholly
with wholesale dealers. In his treatment of those who came into his store
during the interview he was rude and discourteous. He said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I am a radical. I despise and hate the white man. They will always be against
the Ethiopian. I do not want to be called Negro, colored, or "nigger." Either term
is an insult to me or to you. Our rightful name is Ethiopian. White men stole the
black man from Africa and counseled with each other as to what to do with him and
what to call him, for when the Negro learned that he was the first civilized human on
earth he would rise up and rebel against the white man. To keep him from doing
this it was decided to call him Negro after the Niger River in Africa. This was to
keep him from having that knowledge by the Bible, for his right name was Ethiopian.
This was done so we could always be ruled by the white man. I will call your attention
to the Bible. There is not one word of evil against the Children of Israel and
Ethiopia written in it. Ethiopia came out of Israel and God said they are his people
and he will be their God. He also says after the 300 years of punishment he will
never go by [desert] Israel again and will be with him for ever and ever. We find
by the Bible that he, the Ethiopian, is the only child of God.
</p>

<p>
The three hundred years of punishment are up, and this is the year of deliverance.
It started in 1619 when we were stolen from Africa and made slaves. God is taking
care of the black man. Some great destruction will take place, but God's chosen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_481' name='Page_481' href='#Page_481'>481</a></span>
people will be all right. White passers-by from other neighborhoods are the only
people who trouble us. They will call you insulting names or try to annoy you in a
hundred little ways. The white people in the neighborhood are all right. Two white
men ran down an old pet rooster of mine this morning. They were on a motor-cycle and
picked him up, carried him off, paying no heed to me, as I ran two blocks after them.

<i>Ready for trouble.</i>â€”A Negro ex-soldier said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I went to war, served eight months in France; I was married, but I didn't claim
exemption. I wanted to go, but I might as well have stayed here for all the good
it has done me.... No, that ain't so, I'm glad I went. I done my part and I'm
going to fight right here till Uncle Sam does his. I can shoot as good as the next one,
and nobody better start anything. I ain't looking for trouble, but if it comes my
way I ain't dodging.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Agitation and discussion.</i>â€”A Negro lawyer said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Agitation by the press, both white and colored, does nothing but create dissension.
The religious and political leaders have gone from one extreme to the other. Formerly
the Negroes were cringing and ingratiating when dealing with the whites. Now they
are trying to be radical in order to gain notoriety. There is nothing to be gained in
either being servile or radical. I have had indignities heaped upon me by the white
man. Why, my mother was ill when a white man in Georgia took every bit of our
furniture from us, pulling the bed from under her. She screamed with pain each time
they moved the bed, but they left her on the floor. I swore that I would kill that man
and for many years held hatred against him. Now I know it is wrong and only hope
that he has learned better.

<p>
<i>A Negro and a mob.</i>â€”How does a Negro feel when he is being hunted or
chased by a mob? Few persons are able to analyze their emotions under such
stress. It happens, however, that a Negro university student fell victim to the
sportive brutality of a gang of white men in a clash in September, 1920, and
after being chased and hunted for five hours and a half in an unfriendly neighborhood
escaped uninjured. He recounted his experience in an effort at a
purely objective study of his emotions.
</p>

<p>
While at work in a plant just outside Chicago he became ill and was forced
to leave early. Unaware that a riot was in progress, he left a street car to
transfer in a hostile neighborhood. As he neared the corner one of a group of
about twenty young white men yelled: "There's a nigger! Let's get him!"
He boarded a car to escape them. They pulled off the trolley and started into
the car after him. His story follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The motorman opened the door, and before they knew it I jumped out and ran
up Fifty-first Street as fast as my feet could carry me. Gaining about thirty yards on
them was a decided advantage, for one of them saw me and with the shout "There he
goes!" the gang started after me. One, two, three, blocks went past in rapid succession.
They came on shouting, "Stop him! Stop him!" I ran on the sidewalk and
someone tried to trip me, but fortunately I anticipated his intentions and jumped into
the road. As I neared the next street intersection, a husky, fair-haired fellow weighing
about 180 pounds came lunging at me. I have never thought so quickly in all my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_482' name='Page_482' href='#Page_482'>482</a></span>
life as then, I believe. Three things flashed into my mindâ€”to stop suddenly and let
him pass me and then go on; to try to trip him by dropping in front of him; or to keep
running and give him a good football straight arm. The first two I figured would stop
me, and the gang would be that much nearer, so I decided to rely on the last. These
thoughts flashed through my mind as I ran about ten steps. As we came together,
I left my feet, and putting all my weight and strength into a lunge, shot my right
hand at his chin. It landed squarely and by a half-turn the fair-haired would-be
tackler went flying to the road on his face.
</p>

<p>
That was some satisfaction, but it took a lot of my strength, for by this time I
was beginning to feel weak. But determination kept me at it, and I ran on. Then
I came to a corner where a drug-store was open and a woman standing outside. I
slowed down and asked her to let me go in there, that a gang was chasing me; but she
said I would not be safe there, so I turned off Fifty-first Street and ran down the side
street. Here the road had been freshly oiled and I nearly took a "header" as I
stepped in the first pool, but fortunately no accident happened. My strength was
fast failing; the suggestion came into my mind to stop and give up or try to fight it
out with the two or three who were still chasing me, but this would never do, as the
odds were too great, so I kept on. My legs began to wobble, my breath came harder,
and my heart seemed to be pounding like a big pump, while the man nearest me began
to creep up on me. It was then that an old athletic maxim came into my mindâ€”"He's
feeling as tired as you." Besides, I thought, perhaps he smokes and boozes
and his wind is worse than mine. Often in the last hundred yards of a quarter-mile
that thought of my opponent's condition had brought forth the last efforts necessary
for the final spurt. There was more than a medal at stake this time, so I stuck, and
in a few strides more they gave up the chase. One block further on, when I had made
sure that no one was following me on the other side of the street, I slowed down to
walk and regained my breath. Soon I found myself on Forty-sixth Street just
west of Halsted where the street is blind, so I climbed up on the railroad tracks and
walked along them. But I imagined that in crossing a lighted street I could be seen
from below and got down off the tracks, intending to cross a field and take a chance
on the street. But this had to be abandoned, for as I looked over the prospect from
the shadow of a fence I saw an automobile held up at the point of a revolver in the
hands of one member of a gang while they searched the car apparently looking for
colored men.
</p>

<p>
This is no place for a minister's son, I thought, and crept back behind a fence
and lay down among some weeds. Lying there as quietly as could be I reflected on
how close I had come to a severe beating or the possible loss of my life. Fear, which
had caused me to run, now gave place to anger, and a desire to fight, if I could fight
with a square deal. I remembered that as I looked the gang over at Fifty-first and
Ashland I figured I could handle any of them individually with the possible
exception of two, but the whole gang of blood-thirsty hoodlums was too much. Anger
gave place to hatred and a desire for revenge, and I thought if ever I caught a green-buttoned
"Ragen's Colt" on the South Side east of State that one of us would get a
licking. But reason showed me such would be folly and would only lead to reprisals
and some other innocent individual getting a licking on my account. I knew all
"Ragen's" were not rowdies, for I had met some who were pretty decent fellows, but
some othersâ€”ye gods!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_483' name='Page_483' href='#Page_483'>483</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My problem was to get home and to avoid meeting hostile elements. Temporarily
I was safe in hiding, but I could not stay there after daybreak. So I decided to
wait a couple of hours and then try to pass through "No Man's Land"â€”Halsted to
Wentworth. I figured the time to be about 11:30 and so decided to wait until 1:30
or 2:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, before coming out of cover. Shots rang out intermittently; the sky
became illumined; the fire bells rang, and I imagined riot and arson held sway as of
the previous year. It is remarkable how the imagination runs wild under such
conditions.
</p>

<p>
Then the injustice of the whole thing overwhelmed meâ€”emotions ran riot. Had
the ten months I spent in France been all in vain? Were those little white crosses
over the dead bodies of those dark-skinned boys lying in Flanders fields for naught?
Was democracy merely a hollow sentiment? What had I done to deserve such
treatment? I lay there experiencing all the emotions I imagined the innocent victim
of a southern mob must feel when being hunted for some supposed crime. Was this
what I had given up my Canadian citizenship for, to become an American citizen
and soldier? Was the risk of life in a country where such hatred existed worth while?
Must a Negro always suffer merely because of the color of his skin? "There's a
Nigger; let's get him!" Those words rang in my earsâ€”I shall never forget them.
</p>

<p>
Psychologists claim that it is in the face of overwhelming forces that man is prone
to turn to the Supreme Being. I was no longer afraid, only filled with righteous indignation
and a desire to get out of danger. But mingled emotions shook me, and a
flood of tears burst forth. In the midst of it I found myself praying fervently to
God against the injustice of it all, for strength and help to go through safely, and
thanks for my deliverance from the gang which had chased me. Then relief came
from all these pent-up feelings with the determination to get up and try to go throughâ€”and
to fight, if necessary. I began to speculate on means. A freight train came
along, and the impulse came to jump on it and ride out of town until the trouble was
over, but the knowledge of only 15 cents carfare in my pocket compelled the rejection
of this idea. I thought of phoning to a friend to come and get me in his car, but
this was futile, for where could I find a phone and be safe in that neighborhood?
Some clothes on a line in a yard across the field offered a disguise, but even dressed
as a woman I'd need a hat, and that idea had to be abandoned. With resources at an
end, I picked up four rocks for ammunition and started out.
</p>

<p>
For four blocks I glided from shadow to shadow, through alleys. A couple of dogs
nearly "spilled the beans" when they barked just as an automobile came down the
street. I dove for cover until the car had disappeared and then emerged. At Forty-ninth
Street and Union Avenue I climbed up on the railroad tracks and cautiously
walked along them in the darkness. All of a sudden a block ahead appeared what
seemed to be about ten men standing on the tracks, so I dropped to the ground and
made a pair of binoculars out of my hands. For what seemed like five minutes I
watched these forms then decided they were uprights on a bridge and went on. Imagination
and fear can play tricks, and this was one of them.
</p>

<p>
Finally I found myself at Thirty-seventh and Stewart streets, having been
walking northeast instead of east as I thought. I climbed down to the street and
walked through back lanes until I saw the Sox ball park. All was quiet, so I came
out and crossed Wentworth Avenue. At State and Thirty-seventh I saw two colored
fellows waiting for a car and ran up to them. Putting my hands on their shoulders
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_484' name='Page_484' href='#Page_484'>484</a></span>
I said, "Gee! I'm glad to see a dark skin." Then I related my experience. They
assured me the "fun" was all over, and I was thankful. It was twenty-five minutes
to four, just five and a half hours after I had started for home from work. A white
man came along, and my first impulse was to jump on him and beat him up. But
again reason told me he was not responsible for the actions of a gang of rowdies, and
he was as innocent as I had been when set upon.
</p>

<p>
Is such an experience easily forgotten? Recent events would prove to the contrary.
I vowed that morning never to let the sun set on me west of Wentworth
Avenue, and never to go into that section unprotected, even in daytime. On a
recent Sunday the papers came out with an "Extra" about 11:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, announcing a
"Big South Side Fight." I went to the door and hailed a boy. Just then an automobile
with men standing on the running-board came around the corner. The possibility
of another riot flashed through my mind and without looking at the paper I
snapped off the light, closed the door, and prepared for trouble if it came my way.
But the "Fight" had been a gunman's war. This is just indicative of the caution such
an experience develops. It is not a fear, but a wariness in uncertainty.

<h5>
3. DEFENSIVE POLICIES
</h5>

<p>
To stimulate group morale and solidify the sentiments of Negroes for unified
opposition to what they regard as oppressive measures of white people,
many tactics are employed. The most common of these is that of interpreting
the aims and ambitions of Negroes to white persons and of defending
themselves generally against criticism. A selection of types of this "defensive"
sentiment is given.
</p>

<p>
A Negro attorney said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The only way to gain favorable public opinion is to create favorable press notices.
A certain amount of agitation is necessary on the part of colored papers to educate
the race as to what it is entitled to. The American white race has been very successful
in its propaganda that colored people are not entitled to certain things. This
has caused many Negroes to believe that they are not as good as the white people.
</p>

<p>
The press can be a source of evil or of good. It depends upon the point of view.
The difficulty lies in the fact that the white press has the wrong attitude, usually.
A great deal of harm is done by paid workers who will give interviews that will sustain
the viewpoint of the papers. Others desirous of newspaper notoriety are guilty of the
same offense. Usually those interviewed are not capable of giving exact opinions and
viewpoints. Those capable of doing justice to the situation are not sought by
reporters. During the time when there is more calm and people are in a position to
give thoughtful consideration to the question, no effort is made to find out the attitude
of substantial citizens. If this were done the papers would get somewhere.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A letter from a Negro thanking the editor of a northern paper for a fair
editorial said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The colored citizens realize fully the extent to which propaganda is spread against
them in the average newspaper under the guise of news, and when they find someone
who knows that too, and who is strong enough to help, as is the â€”â€” [newspaper],
they thank him with all the strength of their hearts, although their lips may remain
mute.

<i>Negro sentiment regarding racial news in the white press.</i>â€”A Negro weekly
paper said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Whatever be the cause or the motive there is apparently a well organized plan to
discredit the race in America and to bring estrangement between fellow Americans.
A short-sighted ... press is contributing to this estrangement by playing upon
the passions of the undiscriminating and thoughtlessly by its glaring and sensational
headings, emphasizing rumours of alleged crimes by Negroes.

<p>
<i>Flattery as a means of promoting tolerance.</i>â€”A popular Negro orator said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think that the great trouble with us already is that we have allowed the white
people to settle too many things for us. The nation gave you constitutional freedom,
but no man can make you truly free except you yourself. The white man hates
nothing worse than a coward, and the American white man is the most remarkable
human being the world ever knew. He is God's superman. As white and black
have one destiny beneath the Stars and Stripes, so have we the common duties of
citizenship....

<p>
Woodrow Wilson is my leader. What he commands me to do I shall do. Where
he commands me to go I shall go. I had naught of ill will toward Von Bernsdorf
until Wilson pointed him out as a national menace. Whom Woodrow Wilson cannot
receive into fellowship, I cannot receive.

A Negro resident of Chicago for fourteen years, formerly of Louisiana,

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I went to Wilson's last inauguration in Washington and tried to talk to the
President. I got in the gate, but the guard would not let me go farther without a
pass. I went into every place that men were allowed to enter and found no "Jim-Crowing"
in any public place. The nearest approach to it was in the printing department
of the government. There were several colored girls all working at the same
table. In other departments I had seen white and colored together. I went into
every washroom on every floor of one building and must have washed my hands
twenty times.

<i>Negroes, real Americans.</i>â€”A letter from a Negro workman to Governor
Lowden said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Why is it that intelligent colored people, the real Americans and the most humble
and purest nation that ever trod the soil of America since they have been hereâ€”we
have never thrown any bombs; we have never written a black-hand letter and what
disgrace and shameful things we do it was learned to us by our foreparents' masters
down south because they taught them to steal and murder and do all other most
disgraceful things. We have never bombed any white people's homes, but I cannot
see into it why it is that all nations such as the Polish, Japan, Chinaman, Mexican,
German and Russ and now you see what they have done to this country; they have
done everything to overthrow this Government and have got the I.W.W. and the
Red. Where have we done such dirty deeds? We have enriched this soil of America
with our blood in every war for this country and then cannot live where we want to
as an American citizen. We even shed our blood in France to save someone else
money and their homes, and the thanks we got when we come back was a big race
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_486' name='Page_486' href='#Page_486'>486</a></span>
riot which I do believe was started by southern white men to put a disgrace on the
North because the North do not lynch and burn as they do. Of course I know you
cannot do anything by yourself. But if you can get enough men who have got a
backbone to protect the ones who have always protected them this outrage could
be stopped. I read a piece in the <i>Herald-Examiner</i> that it would be a riot here;
that has poisoned the minds of so many people. So now I hope you will try to stop
such trouble.

<i>Defensive philosophy; silence does not mean contentment.</i>â€”A Negro educator
said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Many white men of high intellectual ability and keen discernment have mistaken
the Negro silence for contentment, his facial expression for satisfaction at prevailing
conditions, and his songs and jovial air for happiness. But not always so. These
are his methods of bearing his troubles and keeping his soul sweet under seeming
wrongs. In the absence of a spokesman or means of communication with the whites
over imagined grievances, he has brightened his countenance, smiled and sung to
give ease to his mind. In the midst of it all he is unable to harmonize the teachings
of the Bible which the white Christian placed in his hands with the practices of daily
life. He finds it difficult to harmonize the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of
man, and his faith is put to the test in that "Providence" which enslaved his ancestors,
corrupted his blood and placed upon him stigmas more damaging than to be a leper
or convict by making his color a badge of infamy and his preordained social position
at the bottom of human society. So firmly has his status been fixed by this "Providence"
that neither moral worth, fidelity to trust, love of home, loyalty to country
or faith in God can raise him to human recognition.

<p>
<i>Votes for Negroes.</i>â€”The <i>Crisis</i> for January, 1921, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The astonishing thing about the Bourbon South is its intellectual bankruptcy
when it comes to the Negro. It continually assumes that the Negro is a fool. Some
Negroes are fools, but the proportion among them is steadily decreasing, while that
among the Bourbons seems to increase. When the average white Southerner faces
the problem of racial contact he has absolutely nothing to offer except what he
offered in 1861, namely: the Will of God, Force and Bloodshed, and, "The best friend
in the world to the Negro is the Southern white manâ€”the only one who truly loves
him." We quote from our ever-delightful friend, the editor of the <i>Macon</i> (Ga.)
<i>Telegraph</i>.
</p>

<p>
The tragedy of the situation is that this man believes what he says. He knows
absolutely just the "place" for which God made "niggers"; but to support this sincere
belief he spreads falsehoods. He says that the woman suffrage party by its
secret machinations "probably" caused the blood shed in the Florida elections!
He threatens murder for black men who want to vote, and almost weeps over the misguided
Negroes who have left the Empire State of lynching and gone to Chicago.
</p>

<p>
There seems to be in this man's mind absolutely no conception of the tremendous,
increasing, unswerving development of the Negro. To him all aspiration, unrest,
and complaints of black folk are conspiracies of whites. For the blacks he has no
program, no vision, except that they stay where they have always been, growing more
content with "Jim-Crow" cars, lynching and disfranchisement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_487' name='Page_487' href='#Page_487'>487</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It is inconceivable to the mentality of this section of the white South that such a
program is absolutely impossible. That if, in the end, the price we must pay for
aspiration to modern manhood is death, and death in the most horrible form of public
torture and burning like that in Florida, if to live we must die, then the South will
have us to kill. Any man who does not prefer death to slavery is not worth freedom....
</p>

<p>
The black man must vote. Every Southerner with brains knows this. The
Negro is awaiting his enfranchisement with greater patience than the South has any
right to expect. But he will not wait forever. If he sees gathering signs of sanityâ€”a
willingness to let the intelligent and thrifty vote, an honest effort to establish law
and order and overthrow the rule of the mob, a desire to substitute honest industrial
conditions in place of the organized and entrenched theft of black wealth upon which
southern industry is based todayâ€”such a program, tardy and slow and inadequate
though it be, may count on the infinite patience and long suffering of Ethiopia.

4. RACE CONSCIOUSNESS

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">To My Kinsmen.</span>â€”In a broad sense, the words "Negro" and "Nigger" have no
historical significance. They are used synonymously in the white man's dictionary.
"Negro" is a pure Spanish word meaning "black." The word "Negro," therefore,
may be descriptive of a race, but not the name of it. In reality "Negro" is an alias,
or nickname applied to us originally, in much the same contemptuous spirit as the
black boy is called "Rastus" or "Sambo."
</p>

<p>
The white man writes his history for us to study, makes his scenario with his heroes
and heroines for us to admire, and supplies our newspapers. Through these instrumentalities
he almost entirely controls our thought.

Remember that "a word is the sign of an idea." The kind of an "idea" that
the "sign" stands for depends upon our teaching. If we associate a word, then, with
a noble or degraded idea, we have been taught to do so.
</p>

<p>
You can easily prove this by experimenting with certain words for yourself.
After repeating each word tell what your idea is and what you see: (1) Roman,
(2) Paradise, (3) Statesmen, (4) General. Is the idea or picture you get degraded?
No. The White Press, history, reel and teacher have taken care of that.
</p>

<p>
Now take the following words: (1) Lynched, (2) Jim Crow, (3) Disfranchised,
(4) Negro.
</p>

<p>
What is the result? The words "Lynched," "Jim Crow," "Disfranchised,"
are the signs of degraded ideas. Moreover, "Negro" is very apt to creep into each
one of the three mind pictures and conversely one of the three into the "Negro"
mind picture.
</p>

<p>
Do you understand? Now why is that? That is what Ethiopic culture teaches,
through the "Ancient Order of Ethiopian Princes."
</p>

<p>
If we believe that we come from nowhere and have no history but that of a slave,
our substance will be the charity of our oppressors, and our future handicapped by
doubts and fears.
</p>

<p>
Ancient history knows no "Negro," but ancient history does know Ethiopia and
Ethiopians. Change a family's name and in a generation you cannot tell whether
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_488' name='Page_488' href='#Page_488'>488</a></span>
its foreparents were rogues or saints. It is the same with a race. You cannot trace
your ancestors through the name "Negro."
</p>

<p>
Take away our birthright, our ancient honorable name, "Ethiopian" and you
have stopped the very fountain of our inspiration. If we are "Negroes" we are by
the same dictionary also, "Niggers." The moment we realize, however, that we are
"Ethiopians," we can see the beams from the lamps of Ethiopian culture lighting a
pathway down the shadowy ages, and the fires of ambition are rekindled in our hearts,
because we know that we came from the builders of temples and founders of civilization.

<i>Contrasts of North and South.</i>â€”An investigator's report on home conditions
of retarded children said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The mother is eager to learn, and constantly talks of wanting to attend night
school if the opportunity ever offers itself. She is eager for her girl to complete her
education and wants her to take a business course so she will be independent. "A
white man can take everything from the colored man but his learning," Mrs. â€”â€”
said repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
In coming to Chicago she wasn't sure what she would find, but she had heard
that colored people had a show here. She brought her child here to give her one.
Chicago seems like heaven to her now when she thinks of what she had been through
in the South.
</p>

<p>
When the investigator asked her about the church to which she belonged she
said: "Olivet. I goes every Sunday and Wednesday nights to prayer meeting just to
thank God that he let me live to go to a place of worship like that, a place where my
people worship and ain't pestered by the white men."
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Chicago riot provoked probably the first full expressions of sentiment
from Negroes in their own press. Underlying them are attitudes toward present
race relations. There is a strong note of resentment, and the announcement
of the birth of a "New Negro."
</p>

<p>
The war is credited with bringing about this change. More than 250,000
young Negroes, the pick of the race in health and intelligence, had returned
to the United States, presumably with changed ideas, and perhaps with growing
cynicism as to promises of fair treatment. Perhaps for the first time in
American history the Negro group fought in the 1919 riot as a body against
mob violence. The idea that these disorders are a result of active opposition
to distasteful practices is prominent in practically every Negro discussion.
"The Negro race is facing about" is a familiar statement. Said one Negro
newspaper:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is the utter ignoring of the Negro in the community life that is responsible for
these outbreaks. The controlling whites were absolutely out of touch with the
Negroes, and the races came together in a quarrel and there was no means by which
the trouble could be settled.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_489' name='Page_489' href='#Page_489'>489</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
A monthly magazine, the <i>Favorite</i>, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
If the white man thinks that the rights, privileges and ordinary pursuits of the
Negro can now be annulled at this stage of the world's affairs, he certainly has "another
thought coming." This Washington revolt is only the "handwriting on the wall."
Don't squeeze the Negro too hard; if you do you squeeze him to the bursting point.
The young Negro of today is far different from his foreparents, and will not be content
with anything less than a fair deal.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>New York American</i> said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The dangerous enemy of his race is the colored man that advocates force as a
remedy. There is such a thing as being outnumbered beyond any hope.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A Negro newspaper replied:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There is such a thing, too, as a noble preference of death to a life of slavery. Do
Hearst and Arthur Brisbane think the sentiment of "Give me Liberty or Give me
Death" belongs exclusively to a white skin?
</p>
</div>

<p>
A poem in the <i>Crusader</i> and republished in the <i>Messenger</i> and several other

<i>Defensive measures justified.</i>â€”The general belief among Negroes is that
resistance to violence is justified. Some view this display of counterviolence
as simply defensive measures, some as retaliation, which in substance means
the same.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Washington Eagle</i>, a Negro newspaper, commenting on the beginning
of the Washington riot, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Notwithstanding the fact that these mobs, increasing in number and in violence
each evening, were allowed to harass law-abiding colored citizens for three consecutive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_490' name='Page_490' href='#Page_490'>490</a></span>
evenings, the colored citizens showed no signs of revenge or retaliation. But
when the situation became so terrible that colored citizens could endure it no longer
they rose up almost as one man, and, adhering to the first law of human nature, which
says that self-preservation is the first law of nature, they armed themselves "to the
teeth," to use the phrase of one of the local newspapers. It was only when they
showed this disposition to fight back that the riot ceased.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Messenger</i>, a Negro magazine, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The world knows not that the new Negroes are determined to observe the primal
law of self-preservation whenever civil laws break down; to assist the authorities
to preserve order and prevent themselves and families from being murdered in cold
blood. Surely, no one can easily object to this new and laudable determination.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Opinions of Negroes regarding the conduct of the police.</i>â€”Negro condemnation
of the police seems general. From a large selection of comments two are
given. The <i>Favorite</i> said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

History proves that nearly all race riots are started by white policemen. East
St. Louis, Houston and Washington, D.C., have had terrible cataclysms provoked by
white bluecoats who in nine cases out of ten carry their prejudices with them whenever
they enter black belts. Instead of acting in behalf of law and order white policemen
usually act in behalf of some passion that tells them Negroes are convenient brutes.
For the safety of the twenty-five thousand colored and ten thousand whites in the
Second Ward of Chicago we ask that every white patrolman in the district be replaced
by a colored bluecoat. Chicago must not be added to the list of American cities cut
off from civilization by race riots, and it is up to Mayor William Hale Thompson
and Chief Garrity to see that the honor of that city is preserved.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Washington Eagle</i> thought most of the trouble was due to the overbearing
attitude of the police. It said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Bishop Cottrell, wiring from Holly Springs, Miss., wants the President to call a
conference of representatives of both races to consider the matter of mob law. We
doubt if the President will take the trouble to do anything of the kind: while he is
thinking it over the police in every place had better be instructed to have more
respect for the rights and feelings of the Afro-American people. Most of the trouble
is to be found in the insolent and overbearing attitude of the police.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Negro opinions regarding white newspapers.</i>â€”It is asserted by numerous
Negro papers that certain white papers spurred the rioters to greater lawlessness
in the Washington outbreak, and in some cases settled the date and place
of assembly for attacking parties. The <i>Afro-American</i> quoted from the <i>Washington
Post</i> an excerpt headed "Mobilizing for Tonight," and reading:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It was learned that a mobilization of every available service man stationed in or
near Washington or on leave here has been ordered for tomorrow evening near the
Knights of Columbus hut on Pennsylvania Avenue, between Seventh and Eighth
streets. The hour of assembly is 9 o'clock and the purpose is a "cleanup" that will
cause the events of the last two evenings to pale into insignificance. Whether official
cognizance of this assemblage and its intent will bring about its forestalling cannot be
told.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_491' name='Page_491' href='#Page_491'>491</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Afro-American</i> added:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Commenting on this article Secretary Shillady of the National Association
declares: "In view of the fact that the 'mobilization' announced by the <i>Washington
Post</i> had not been ordered by any authority, military or civil, does not the passage
show intent by the <i>Washington Post</i> to bring about such mobilization?"
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another Negro paper in Washington carried the criticism farther:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

Editorials are supposed to concern those topics that are most important to the
community in which they are written. No one can deny the importance of the race
riots that disgraced the name of fair America's Capital during the present week;
yet two of the leading daily papers of the city found everything to fill their editorial
columns but the proper attempts to discourage mob violence and a disposition to
place the blame where it justly belongs. The rioting, in itself, was a deplorable disgrace,
but a greater disgrace is that the daily newspapers should have encouraged the
rioting by the glaring, ugly headlines that they gave it, rather than discourage the
riots in editorials.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>National Defender and Sun</i> replied to an editorial of the <i>Chicago
Tribune</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

In a recent edition of the <i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i>, which calls itself the world's
greatest newspaper, in discussing the recent race riot in Chicago, it had this to say:
"Can the two races continue to live in peace in Chicago without segregation? We
have for some time criticized the South for its treatment of its black citizens. We
believe since the race riot in Chicago that segregation, separate cars, will be the only
cure to prevent race riots in the future." We are very much surprised at the statement
of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. Does the world's greatest newspaper forget that
Atlanta, Ga., Memphis, Tenn., Arkansas and Texas, had great race riots, and
that all of the above-named states have their Jim Crow laws and segregated
district?
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>New York Age</i> had this to say:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

So much clamor and bad blood have been aroused by the repeated charge of
assaults attempted upon women in the city of Washington, that more than ordinary
significance attaches to a news item found tucked away in an inconspicuous position
on an inside page of the <i>Washington Times</i>. It was headed: "Woman Now Denies
She Was Attacked," and read as follows: "The case of an alleged attack on Mrs.
Minnie Franklin, 1361 K. Street Southeast, by two Negroes near Fifteenth and H.
Sts., Northeast, Thursday night, was closed last night when according to detectives,
the woman said the story was a fabrication. Several headquarters detectives questioned
the woman yesterday and then went over the ground where the alleged attack
was supposed to have occurred, but could find no evidence of a struggle."
</p>

<p>
This reported case of "assault" had "scare" headlines at the time it was supposed
to have occurred, and it looked as if the daily papers were trying to provoke
another riot. Later, by the admission of the accuser, the police and the press, the
charge was shown to be groundless. Time and again these charges of assaults have
been shown to be "faked," and the most credulous should be brought to see the
necessity of searching investigation before pronouncing the accused guilty. Hysteria,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_492' name='Page_492' href='#Page_492'>492</a></span>
by newspaper suggestion, may be at the foundation of many a case of reported
"assault."
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Charges of southern propaganda in the North.</i>â€”A wide distinction has been
made by Negro observers between the Washington and Chicago riots, the former
being called a typical southern, and the latter a typical northern, riot.
Reasons for this are given in the different forms of incentive to rioting. The
Washington reasons were largely sentimental and bore a striking resemblance
to the Atlanta riot about 1906. Reports of attacks on white women, played up
in the newspapers, were sufficient to set the current going. The sentiment
of the South is said to have been behind this outbreak. Said the <i>Chicago
Defender</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

It is easy to see that the southern white man is at the bottom of race riots in the
northern cities to which we have migrated in recent years.... It is idle to suppose
that the black man was the only migrator from the South; every northern community
is practically overrun with southern whites of both sexes. In many of the northern
cities a majority of the white women employed as clerks and saleswomen in department
stores, telephone operators and other fields of industry are from the South.
In every place where men are utilized, including public officials, judges and prosecuting
attorneys, some of them are also from the South.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Remedies.</i>â€”The <i>Chicago Defender</i> said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

To emphasize the fact that no self-respecting citizen had anything to do with the
disgraceful affairs recently witnessed here and in Washington, thousands of circulars
have been distributed by our people and to our people filled with good, wholesome
advice as to being good, law-abiding citizens. Our only salvation lies in harmony,
and both elements must come to understand that each is necessary to the other,
and that with all pulling together, democracy for America will no longer be a theory,
but a reality.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The foregoing examples of sentiment by no means cover the varieties of
Negro opinion. They are merely illustrative of different types. The peculiarities
of group behavior which appear to be the attributes of the Negro group
would doubtless show themselves in any other groups similarly placed in the
social scale. There would at the same time be no more likelihood of their
being understood. Situations develop which appear to the uninitiated white
observer strange and even dangerous. That they do represent very definite
and calculated programs of action within certain circles of the Negro group may
be illustrated by a few examples.
</p>

<p>
At a garment manufacturer's plant thirty colored girls were employed in
a separate unit. When a white girl was employed, the colored girls walked
out. They explained that when they first began work in a plant employing
white girls a precedent for this action was given. If white girls were too proud
to work with colored girls, then colored girls should be too proud to work with
white girls. It required much effort on the part of the Urban League to correct
their viewpoints.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_493' name='Page_493' href='#Page_493'>493</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A short time ago there was considerable agitation among certain groups
of Negroes over the appointment of a Negro principal for one of the elementary
schools. His appointment was strongly opposed by Negroes. Although this
may have seemed inexplicable to white people, the action was not wholly illogical
from the viewpoint of Negroes. The school in question, near the Negro
residential area, had an attendance of about 70 per cent Negro children.
Negroes reasoned thus: If a Negro principal were appointed the white teachers
would eventually resign or for one reason or another be transferred; the white
parents then would withdraw their children because there would be no white
teachers, and so the first step would be accomplished toward segregation of
Negroes in the public schools. It was segregation that was opposed, although
the advancement of one of their number must be sacrificed.
</p>

<p>
Marcus Garvey, a West Indian Negro, with a remarkable genius for organization,
four years ago began a venture on a commercial basis and developed it
into a definite racial movement. He conceived the notion of establishing trade
relations with Africa, and accordingly organized a steamship line. It was a
large undertaking. There were few large Negro investors, and if money was to
be raised it had to come in numerous small amounts rather than in a few large
ones. Again, if commercial relations were to be established, there must be
intelligent Negroes at the African end. The effort grew into another "Back
to Africa" movement. To increase interest it was necessary to campaign
actively, using appeals calculated to arouse the great mass of Negroes. This
Garvey did with such success that his "Back to Africa" slogans created a far
larger movement than his original commercial proposition. The Universal
Negro Improvement Association attracted more interest and members. The
<i>Negro World</i>, a newspaper with a constant and powerful appeal to racial
pride, racial solidarity, and racial independence, is the organ of the movement.
During the summer of 1920 a great convention was held. A provisional president
of the Black Republic was elected, and was acclaimed the recognized
leader of the black people of the world. The women were organized into
"Black Cross" nurses and it was planned to establish a "Black House" in
Washington. The movement has been widened to include the black peoples of
the British colonies and Africa. An alliance of sympathy has been declared
with peoples similarly disadvantaged. Thus Ireland's contention for home
rule is supported, in spite of the supposed general hostility between the Negroes
and the Irish in the United States. The movement is credited with 4,000,000
followers in different parts of the world.
</p>

<h4>
VI. OPINIONS OF FIFTEEN NEGROES ON DEFINITE RACIAL PROBLEMS
</h4>

<p>
What are Negroes thinking? Few white persons know the intimate reactions
of Negroes to problems which they face daily. Yet it is obvious that the
conduct of Negroes in practically every phase of life is determined by these
very sentiments, which for the white world remain a closed book.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_494' name='Page_494' href='#Page_494'>494</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was with this in mind that a series of questions was put to seventeen
Negroes whose intelligence and public-mindedness qualified them for critical
self-analysis as well as dispassionate examination of racial issues as they affect
the minds, behavior, and policies of Negroes as a group. Ten of these Negroes
lived in Chicago and represented an ordinary type of the intelligent Negro.
Five of them lived outside of Chicago. Included in this latter number were
two Negroes whose writings have been widely read and who may be said to
exercise some influence over the thinking of Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The fifteen whose replies are presented here included business men, physicians,
ministers, school teachers, lawyers, and social workers. Two were
women.

<h5>
ARE RACE RELATIONS IMPROVING?
</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: Putting aside for the moment the question of right and wrong and the
iniquity of the causes back of present relations, do you believe that the
relations are becoming better or worse, or are they at a standstill?
</p>

<p class="tdh">
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. Better, decidedly better. If it becomes unprofitable to lynch Negroes, or
unprofitable to shoot them up in riots, they will probably more and more be
let alone. The riots in Chicago and Washington mean that not only Negroes
will lose their lives. They also indicate to me that the Negro feels that his
back is more and more to the wall, and he is bestirring himself. So long as
he is satisfied, his case is hopeless. When he begins to force respect he will
usher in the dawn of a new day. Again there is an increasing number of
evidences that white people are waking up to the conditions. Negroes feel
that some of the "Study Groups" are ineffective, but the fact remains that
at one time the race question was not deemed worthy of study except
by Negroes. When all is said, I would rather be living in 1920 than in
1870.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. The relations are becoming worse. Relatively speaking, race relations
in America have not kept pace with progress in many fields along other lines.
The great desideratum is that the Negro change his point of view.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. The present relations between the races seem more tense than formerly.
This is due to the fact that Negroes have developed within the past few years
a greater race consciousness, a great race respect. The immigration from
the South which permitted him to enter into the industrial life of the North
with very few hindrances, to partake of its civic life without an ever-constant
reminder of race, was one of the main factors in increasing race consciousness
and race respect. Another factor was the treatment as equals and fellow
human beings of the Negro soldiers by the French soldiery and people.
These things have caused the Negro to demand the respect which he is entitled
to as a man and the privileges due him as a citizen. The whites at the present
time still object to giving him these. This causes friction. I believe, however,
that it will be lessened as soon as the whites realize that these demands
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_495' name='Page_495' href='#Page_495'>495</a></span>
of the Negro will not be withdrawn but will continue to be made with greater
insistence.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. Better.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. Much was gained through the war. However, at the present time things
seem to be at a standstill.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. Racial relations between all races were never more acute nor more keenly
felt and resented than during the present day.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. Conditions, I believe, are getting a little better.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. I don't believe that consideration of right and wrong influences fundamental
reactions. One's conception of advantage and disadvantage determines
the character of every act. I believe that all social relations are in a state
of flux and that with the improvement of mankind which is coming with the
evolution of a sense of higher values there will be an improvement in human
relationships.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. Race relations on the whole are growing worse instead of better, and they are
crystallizing in the wrong direction. The whites are adjusting their conscience
to their conduct, and are consciously or unconsciously justifying violation
of the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, the Sermon on the Mount,
the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States
at the behest of race prejudice.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. They are becoming distinctly worse as each year solidifies the hatred and
crystallizes the opinions of the whites which immediately subsequent to the
Civil War were in a chaotic state.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. The last year or so has shown that riots are more quickly started. In our
opinion race relations are likely to get much worse, especially if the present
flood of European immigration continues. But getting worse to become
better is much like a boil which, after it gathers and breaks, leaves the body
in a healthier condition. Negroes are becoming more and more determined
to enjoy their constitutional rights.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. I am in doubt.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
13. I am an optimist. I believe relations are becoming better.
</p>

<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. Yes, money and wealth are the root of all good and evil. In North Carolina,
a rich Negro, McCary, who, it was alleged, had been caught in intimate relations
with a leading white woman, was sued for money damages instead of
being lynched. Money and wealth must be widely diffused enough to make
an appreciable difference, however; isolated cases of wealth ordinarily engender
friction and hatred.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. No, because I personally know many who are highly respected and kindly
treated in their communities though in very humble circumstances.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. I believe that money or wealth causes more respect to be accorded within
white people's hearts, but it is more likely to increase racial feeling than to
lessen it. The element of jealousy among poorer whites probably gives rise
to such statements as keeping the Negro in his place. The whites of better
circumstances merely use these existing feelings to gain their own selfish ends.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. Yes, and no. Money is power. The power over a man's subsistence is the
power over his will. The individual who has money is sought because he is
in a position to confer advantages. He is likewise hated because he can
inflict pain. Were race prejudice logical and based upon reason and not
hysteria, the procurement of money and the consequent demonstration of
basic equality would improve conditions. However, the majority of persons
do not think but are exploited. Religious dogmas and racial antipathies
being useful adjuncts in the process are sufficient to outweigh material
or rational considerations.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. Absolutely.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. The possession of money causes whites to accord the Negro more respect and
better treatment if the particular Negro can intelligently handle his affluent
situation so as to demand such.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. I think that money and the acquisition of wealth make an appreciable
difference in the degree of respect in which Negroes are held by their white
neighbors; not that the prejudice against the race is reduced considerably
or possibly to any extent, but because men worship dollars, and if they are
possessed by Negroes, Negroes fall in for additional respect as the holders
of wealth.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. I believe that the acquisition of wealth causes marked increase in respect,
provided that a fairly large group of Negroes in that community respectively
are the possessors; but for merely one or two persons to acquire wealth in a
community is not likely to inspire respect. It may cause its opposite. I
assume, of course, that a fair intelligence was necessary to secure the wealth.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. Intelligence and wealth are necessary to the self-respect of the Negro. I
doubt not that in many instances they would increase racial friction for the
time being; but the time must come and is now near at hand, when the white
race must recognize that the whole is greater than any of its parts. A community
like Chicago, for instance, cannot be intelligent if the Negro is ignorant;
it cannot be competent if the Negro is inefficient; it cannot be virtuous
if the Negro is vicious; it cannot be healthy if the Negro is diseased. Intelligence
and wealth will not of themselves solve the race problem, but the
problem cannot be solved without intelligence and wealth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_497' name='Page_497' href='#Page_497'>497</a></span>
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. Money and wealth do make a difference in the amount of respect accorded
to individuals, as they lessen the causes for class antagonism. The white
man accords esteem to those who are able to secure good clothing, decent
homes, education, and indulge in what are considered luxuries. These things,
too, increase the respect the Negro has for himself and make him demand
respect from others. The treatment accorded him is not likely to be changed
as his advancement tends to increase hatred among the whites whom he
rises above, and a desire not to treat him as an equal among those whose
level he reaches.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. Money, commerce, rule the world. The average white man is happiest when
he sees the Negro down. But if the Negro has money he is willing to conceal
his prejudice and trade with him. Money, in the possession of no matter
whom, commands fear, which is the nearest most human beings get to having
respect for others. While one rich Negro in a town, in most instances,
would receive pretty much the same treatment as other Negroes, yet a
hundred rich Negroes in that same town would certainly make a big difference.
Apply this ratio to the nation. A rich Negro, even in Georgia or
Mississippi, certainly has a far pleasanter lot than a poor white.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. Yes.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
13. Yes, it does for white people. To quote a friend, "It is easy for anybody to
be respectful and courteous to a million dollars." This is especially true of
Americans.

<i>Question</i>: Do you believe that if Negroes were 100 per cent literate it would make
any great difference in race relations? Are general and higher education
likely to widen the breach between Negroes and white persons, increase intolerance,
resentment, sensitiveness to insults, or can a quieted process of adjustment
or complete fusion of interests be expected?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. Education will help decidedly, especially that kind of education which gives
Negroes a command of some special accomplishment in any field of endeavor.
Higher education will not in my opinion widen the breach if Negroes will
consciously and deliberately set out to educate white people as to their ideals,
ability and character, and at the same time labor to increase the spirit of
self-help and self-confidence among their own group which will serve to decrease
ignorance and irresponsibility among the less fortunate and untrained
members of the race.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_498' name='Page_498' href='#Page_498'>498</a></span>
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. I conceive that literacy in itself is a cure for nothing except illiteracy. One-hundred-per-cent
literate Negroes without proper use of their literacy may
even make matters worse. General and higher education may be expected
to make matters better only if there is general and higher education among
whites and the education on both sides is of the right kind. In America, at
present, education, where it touches race lines, appears to be more propaganda
than education. It is reported that some histories of reconstruction taught to
Negroes by the state in parts of the United States emphasize and detail their
shortcomings and omit their virtues. Obviously such education is education
for mistrust, unrest, conflict. It educates the races apart, and its logical
consequence is conflict. I am ready to answer, then, that general and higher
education which emphasizes likeness and passes over without undue attention
unlikeness, education which aims to have men live in harmony and cooperation
and does not aim to array classes against classes and races against
races by omissions and emphasis, may be expected to better our race relations
in the United States provided it finds lodgment in the school systems of both
races.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. If 10,000,000 literate Negroes were environed with 100,000,000 white men,
the majority of whom were below their cultural level, the dominant minds
among the whites would arouse ethnic antagonisms as an economic weapon
to be used in promoting their selfish ends. I believe that there is not a
single force, ethical, religious, or of any type, sufficiently powerful to cause
an individual to forego what he believes to be his highest advantage, and the
appeal to group instincts is the easiest method of securing mass action.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. If Negroes were 100 per cent literate they would certainly be more sensitive
to insults and more resentful. I should expect a great increase in racial
differences, unless those Negroes imbibed a tendency to non-resistance.
That, however, is far from likely. With universal literacy, a larger acquaintance
with current events and conditions, Negroes could immeasurably
improve their living conditions, but their contacts with the whites would be
far more unpleasant.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. One hundred per cent literacy among Negroes would make a huge difference.
In the long run it would lessen the breach between Negroes and white persons,
for Negroes would strive for equality. The most essential thing is to produce
a change in the mental equipment of the Negro. The white man's mind will
take care of itself. What is needed is a more balanced and equal meeting
of the minds. But there would be bloodshed at the beginning.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. Resentment and sensitiveness to insults will increase on the part of Negroes
as they grow in intelligence, but as their spirits rebel more insistently and
positively against insults, it cannot help but have its effect upon white men
who ignorantly mistreat them, and if the respect growing out of love does not
follow, the respect growing out of tolerance, as in the case of the Jews in
America, will ensue and result in recognition of equal intelligence and culture.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. Literacy must be 100 per cent on both sides to bring about a "complete fusion
of interests" or a "quieted process of adjustment." Intelligent Negroes
among uneducated whites would aggravate the situation.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. If Negroes were 100 per cent literate they would command more respect,
because men always command more respect when they are intelligent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_499' name='Page_499' href='#Page_499'>499</a></span>
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. I believe in education first, last, and always as a leveller and as a bulwark
of defense. There is no race prejudice among broadly cultured people. Art
knows no such distinctions.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. (<i>a</i>) Yes. (<i>b</i>) Not, if at the same time the education of the whites is broadened
and made more general. (<i>c</i>) Better education of both races will facilitate a
fusion of interests, beginning probably in economic relations.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. It would make them much more bitter, for (<i>a</i>) the Negro would be more
sensitive to injustice and have more of the combative spirit which literacy
usually gives, and (<i>b</i>) whites would be more jealous and anxious to show the
Negro his place. I believe that such an intensification of the struggle is
desirable and necessary, as I don't believe that the brilliant ideas necessary
for solution of the race problem can come other than as the children of the most
intense and bitter racial conflict. Of course it would defeat its purpose if
such a conflict were bloody, as then we would have a long period of the
nauseating burden such as America suffers with today, viz.: the North
attempting to reconcile the South.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. Literacy will make a difference also in race relations. The difference will
increase in degree as literacy advances beyond the mere ability to read and
write to a wider participation in every field of educational or intellectual
endeavor. As far as I have been able to observe, the breach between whites
and Negroes is widened as Negroes advance in education and culture. The
educated Negro rarely comes in contact with the white man as a menial or
laborerâ€”the only point of contact which the great majority of white people
want. He will respect the Negro teacher, lawyer, doctor, or business man
who knows his work thoroughly and can do as well as he. He is not likely,
however, to find any reason to co-operate with this class of Negroes, and
the Negroes do seek such co-operation.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
13. (<i>a</i>) Yes. (<i>b</i>) In slavery times whites made it a crime to teach Negroes to
read. That desire, in up-to-date garb, remains in the breast of most whites
today. To many white persons a Negro of superior talent and refinement
is a more detestable production than the most pronounced rogue. Most
white persons, even of the best quality, are secretly displeased at a Negro of
this type. They were brought up to regard Negroes as being below them, and
the sight is a blow to their vanity. (<i>c</i>) A dollar talks much more sweetly
than Emerson or Shakespeare and even Christ to most men, therefore a
process of adjustment or complete fusion of interests will be effected chiefly
through trade relationship, not esthetics.

<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: If unrestricted suffrage were given Negroes throughout the United States,
would matters be helped?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. Equal suffrage between the races in some parts of the country would doubtless
precipitate a temporary disturbance, but it is not thinkable that under
democratic institutions any group or class can be permanently or for a
long while refused equal participation in the government under which they
live and by which they are controlled. Shall we do evil that good may come?
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. Every appreciable increase in power among Negroes will be met with jealousy
and repression by the whites. Unrestricted suffrage does not mean
much when people have guns at the polls and dare other people to vote. Its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_500' name='Page_500' href='#Page_500'>500</a></span>
inception would mean acute racial trouble, I think, but if the Negroes used
the same means and methods to register their vote as the whites do to keep
them from registering it, and kept it up long enough, ultimately conditions
would be very much improved where Negroes constitute about half the population
of a unit.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. Yes. Even though Negroes might not vote intelligently at the outset, they
would tend to vote for their own welfare. The Negro does not feel wholeheartedly
that he is a part of the American people. But with the vote
he would be in a better position to work for common ends. Though voting
for the capitalist parties would not mean much to the Negro, a vote for the
money barons is better than no vote at all.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. Unrestricted suffrage is a right as well as a privilege. It is essential for
building up the sense of responsibility and loyalty among any group of people
in a democracy founded on the ideals of the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. Yes, the ballot is a protection which the Negro now is intelligent enough to
use and keep. In the present segregated condition of the Negro, the ballot
has a genuine property value. Police protection, better lighted and better
paved streets, I am convinced, must come to him through the ballot or
else he does not get them.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. Unrestricted Negro suffrage would help a great deal in securing for Negroes
the things it is possible to secure through the use of the ballot. Political
parties, as well as the Negro himself, would realize the power of Negro suffrage
and would doubtless be inclined to cater to that vote. The exercise of such
unlimited suffrage is likely to increase for a time the tenseness in race relations,
as the whites would not readily give up the domination they have secured.
The agitation in Ohio and in the Middle West over the exercise by the
Negro of his suffrage shows how clearly the white man fears the power of
the ballot when used by the Negro.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. Other things remaining the same, it would not.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. Not necessarily by that fact alone. The ultimate value of the right of suffrage
is conditioned by the intelligence with which that right is used.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. This goes without saying. In Chicago, Negroes exercise considerable
influence in the city administration, because of their strong political power.
The same is true of New York and Cleveland. Apply this to the nation.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. Yes.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. Yes, if we had a third party with racial cohesion.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. Suffrage to be effective must be taken and not conferred. "Who would be
free, himself must strike the blow." A man has no right that he can't protect
and defend.

<p class="tdh">
1. Religion, if it ever becomes a vital force in the everyday affairs of people,
will be one of the greatest forces in solving race difficulties. At the present
time its influence is practically nil. The average church is still calling worn-out
theology religion; those which have adopted a more modern and practical
view of religion are too few to exert any influence in race problems.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. Religion per se, to my mind, has failed, but Christianity, the spirit manifested
by Jesus Christ in his life and which he commanded his followers to
imitate, if adopted in its vital truth and simplicity by all professing Christians,
could solve all the difficulties.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. Religion might be helpful in solving racial difficulties if it were triedâ€”but it
has not been very largely tried yet.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. Religion as a solvent of racial difficulties is necessary, but both groups will
need to practice it to the same degree.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. The religion of America, or of any other country, is merely an index to the
national character. Religion expresses itself in the church, and the church
is a capitalistic institution. Expressed religion in America, because its
pecuniary existence largely depends upon the rank and file of the people who
support it, will not rise above the prejudices and folkways of that rank and
file. Religion will not solve many racial difficulties or differences.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. Religion hardly touches the deeper motivations. It may regulate details,
but usually the priest-craft succeeds by sophistry, emphasis or omission in
avoiding certain fundamental issues in their religious exhortations. It
often appears that the preacher is retained to idealize the crassness of the
world, and unpleasant things are simply taboo. He must look to his salary.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. It has no utility. It had no utility in the world war and so a fortiori could
have no utility in our race problem where more bitter issues are involved.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. Unfortunately religion has little sanction over the social conduct where
interest and passions are involved. This was too sadly manifested in the
world war. It is to be hoped, however, that there may arise a moral and
spiritual renaissance under whose sanction religion may exercise controlling
influence over the frictional relations among men.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. Very much overestimated is religion as a solvent of racial differences. Neither
Negroes nor whites have enough confidence in it to put it into practical application.
No one thing will bring about the Negro's real emancipation. The
fight must be carried on in every sphere where prejudice has vitiated relations.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. Religion has failed to solve the racial difficulties and differences in America
because its principles have never been practiced by the people. Religion
has remained a beautiful theory. If the religious principles were practiced
there would be no racial difficulties.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. Utterly valueless. The average individual cannot think. He lives only in
the concrete. Material advantages outweigh philosophical benefits. Deprive
religion of the moving force of fear which its exponents engender, and it will
entirely cease to be dynamic.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. The religion of Christ will prove a solvent if men ever give it a trial.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
13. Religion, in our opinion, has never settled any question. Nothing else contains
so much the germs of strife. Mankind, throughout the ages, has never
been able to agree on it. The history of Europe, Asia and Northern Africa
is one long record of warring religions.

<h5>
SOCIAL ADJUSTMENTS
</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: What are some of the most pronounced mental complexes experienced in
adjusting your personal desires and expectations to the present social system?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. A constant haunting feeling when in the presence of white persons that they
desire to shun me because of my color; that they are eager to use me to further
their ends under the guise of piety or patronizing the "good-feeling-toward-your-people"
attitude. I suffer from time to time an acute embarrassment
because of uncouth conduct in the presence of white persons on the part
of uncultured Negroes. Such conduct embarrasses me generally, but the
presence of white persons who are supposed to be inimical seems to be the
dominant element in the situation.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. The most pronounced mental complex which I experience in adjusting my
desires and expectations to the present social system is not the "inferiority
complex" with which most Negroes are charged by the whites. I desire all
that the social system affords; but as to expectation it is necessary for me to
use auto-hypnotism to make myself expect it in order that I can present to
the white man the front of optimism, the necessary air of expectancy to secure
success. The shocks and disappointments which a Negro must constantly
experience tend to get him in the attitude of expecting nothing.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. I can't describe the mental complexes, but some are caused by situations such
as these: I go to the library to get a book, and I am told that I must sit in
a seat among dusty shelves of newspaper files at a table marked "For colored
people"; in order to see a play I have to sit in the gallery. I submit to that
and when I get to the theater, I am told that no seats are reserved for colored
people. I go to a lecture by the Hon. Mr. So and So (white) and he discusses
the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, creating much enthusiasm
among the unthinking and some of the thinking. Then the next morning
I take up the paper of which the same gentleman is the editor, and read a
sneering editorial on the race question, and so on.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. Personally, I am able to impersonalize my relation to the situation, and
experience no mental perplexities. I try to preserve a rational attitude in an
irrational environment and objectify cruelty, injustice and wrong. I know
that I as an individual am not Jim Crowed, or disfranchised or socially isolated;
it is the race to which I belong. My only perplexity is how to remove
these racial, not personal, disqualifications.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. Determination to fulfill my personal desires in spite of the present social
system; a loss of respect for the white man's sense of justice.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. The arrogance of the poor ignorant white man and the snobbishness of the
middle class. This is the stumbling-block for the future of our race to
overcome.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. Trying to get white persons, as employers, etc., to accept me as a man first
of all, then to judge me on my merits, irrespective of my color. Trying to
attain to the same degree of success and liberty of any other man of my
training and experience in spite of the world in which I live.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. Amused and almost cynical tolerance. A desire to reap the greatest possible
advantages from the system, without permitting my intelligence to admit
that it is right because it is personally advantageous.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_503' name='Page_503' href='#Page_503'>503</a></span>
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. My desires are never adjusted to the present "social system"; they are constantly
out of harmony with the practices of our so-called democracy, as these
practices relate to the Negro.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. If this question means what I think it does, space will not permit an intelligent
answer.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. A hyper-sensitiveness in regard to the subject Negro; a tendency to see
racial antagonism as a motive of conduct in every act of white persons when
perhaps it is sometimes absent; a hesitancy about entering public places or
approaching individuals for fear of rebuff or insult; a withdrawal into a Negro
world in which almost every thought and act are colored by a racial aspect
before a humanitarian one, are some of the mental complexes experienced in
a greater or less degree by almost every colored person.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: Do you believe that Negroes are prejudiced against white persons?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. Some are, but the prejudice is due to nurture rather than to nature.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. Prejudice means pre-judgment. Negroes come into the world to find most
white persons disliking them. They grow up in an atmosphere where they
find whites ready to insult them because of the color Nature saw fit to give
them. Therefore, knowledge, not prejudice, causes Negroes to dislike whites.
Human beings, and even dumb animals, love only those who love them. The
average Negro is, however, quick to drop this defensive attitude when he
meets a fair-minded white person. Perhaps too easily, as he is often taken
advantage of by shrewd whites disguised as friends.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. I do not believe that Negroes are inherently prejudiced against the white
race. Personally, I have absolutely no such prejudice. I do not believe
that the white race is inherently prejudiced against the Negro, but that it is
wholly a feeling stimulated by social opinion which can be modified and controlled.
I put in evidence the facts: First, when social pressure is removed,
white women marry Negro men, and white men marry Negro women.
Second, the superior always shows prejudice against the inferior, whether
superiority is claimed on basis of wealth, culture, birth, or position. The
prejudices of inferior against superior is never so pronounced as that of
superior against inferior. Natural antipathy is mutually reciprocal. Third,
some white persons are less influenced by it than others. Fourth, race
antagonism as such is scarcely discernible where Latin civilization and the
Catholic religion are in control. Fifth, it does not exist in the Mohammedan
dispensation. Sixth, the experience of thousands of Negro soldiers in
France proves its comparative absence. Seventh, race prejudice seems to be
principally the vice of the Teuton and the Anglo-Saxon, which must be subject
to ultimate control. It will not be quite so strong among Germans as
it was before the war.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. I do not believe that Negroes as a race are prejudiced against white people,
although I am conscious of an increasing prejudice against white people on the
part of many individual Negroes, especially educated colored women who live
in the South and resent keenly the indiscriminate approaches of white men.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. Many Negroes are cynical of all the professions of white men. They often
express their hatred of white people openly. I think, however, that feeling
is more prevalent among the younger Negroes than among the older ones.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_504' name='Page_504' href='#Page_504'>504</a></span>
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. Many pretend to be. Most of them are not.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. Yes, 98 per cent of them are.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. Not as individuals. They are affected by the spirit of mass hostility to dissimilar
masses based upon the desire to appropriate and retain advantages.
Racial prejudices are the products of the will of dominant individuals evoking
responses from weaker intelligences and serving the purpose of the dominating
mind.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. If so, to a very slight extent. What feeling most Negroes have is created
almost solely to offset the prejudice and antagonism of the whites. The prejudice
of the whites I might describe as primary; that of the colored, secondary.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. Yes; too much so among some groups.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. Negroes in most cases are very much prejudiced against whites.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. Yes. The difference lies in the degree. Prejudice is artificial. It is learned.
The white boy and girl have been "taught" more prejudice than the Negro.
Negroes seldom teach prejudice outright. When they learn it, it is inescapable.
America is a school, I fear, at present where even the most backward
learns something of prejudice whether he will it or not.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
13. I believe there is a strong prejudice against white persons. This antipathy is,
I believe, not based on racial unlikeness, but on resentment because of cruel
treatment as an inferior.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: Are you ever conscious of a feeling of racial inferiority or even the desire
to compensate for a supposed inferiority?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. I attribute inferiority and superiority alike to individuals, not race. I have
every confidence that my race is capable of producing as great men, and proportionately
as many of them, as any other race under the sun. I trace to
environment the responsibility for not releasing their energy upon constructive
work, but concentrating it upon gaining a living or a chance to gain a
living. Many times I feel the desire to compensate for a supposed inferiority,
because I believe in nailing a lie wherever possible.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. I never have a feeling of racial inferiority or a desire to compensate for a
supposed inferiority (with reservations). I am usually cognizant of the fact
that most white people consider the Negro an inferior. This often causes the
bristles to rise on my back.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. Personally, at no moment of our lives. The Negro is really superior in
stamina. His race is progressing, while the whites appear to be standing still.
The white race has had seven thousand years or more of education and civilization,
yet in this prosperous republic today the average white person is
comparatively poor and possesses little education. The Negro, in spite of
the oppressive handicap due to color, is progressing along all lines, commercial,
professional and artistic.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. I am never conscious of racial inferiority, but I am a firm believer in the theory
that any human being will be whatever his environment and his heredity
will make of him, regardless of the color of his skin or the form of his skull.
One in considering this point of view should be sure not to confuse the words
"inferiority" and "inequality."
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. No.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_505' name='Page_505' href='#Page_505'>505</a></span>
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. I feel no desire to apologize to the world because I am a colored woman; I
had to be of some race, and here I am.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. No. I believe that accidents of environment determine relative positions.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. Decidedly no! I believe absolutely in my own worth as a man and as a Negro
and defer only to wider experience, knowledge, or skill, whether possessed
by white persons or Negroes.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. No!
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. No.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. I never have a feeling of racial inferiority or a desire to compensate for a
supposed inferiority.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. Personally, I am absolutely unconscious of any feeling of racial inferiority.
I recognize the control of social forces and influences which may seem too
strong to be overcome at present. I simply suffer it to be so now.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
13. I have never felt any racial inferiority, though always when thrown in
school work or business with white people the desire to do my work as well
or better than they is very strong. This desire comes primarily from a desire
to show that the Negro is not inferior in his ability.

<h5>
NEGRO PROBLEMS
</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: Do you believe that there should be recognized leaders of Negroes? Are
there such persons whom you regard as qualified for leadership? Discuss
their merits and demerits.
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. As long as the dominant power treats with us as with Negroes rather than as
with American citizens, there will be need of recognized leaders; but these
leaders should be chosen by the Negroes themselves, not chosen and imposed
by others.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. Yes and no. Theoretically and ultimately, no. Practically and immediately,
yes. In any clearly differentiated group the spokesman should come
from and grow out of conditions within the group. In a community in which
there were cultural and not ethnic divisions there would be no need for Negro
leaders. What was good for the hive would be for the good of each bee.
However, in a community in which color is a target, defensive alliances under
the best possible leadership are a <i>sine qua non</i>. I am too close to the problem
to have sufficient perspective to attempt the discussion of personalities.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. Logically, no. Practically, under present conditions it is imperative to have
Negro leaders. Where people do not read much, do not study much, they
are incapable of doing much thinking. Better a bad leader under such
circumstances than no leader at all. The very clashes between rival leaders
with their several points of view force the rank and file to attend to conditions
and compare conflicting views. This often marks the beginning of
interests in striving to improve conditions. The merits of leaders are considered
in another place.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. I do not think that it will be possible, or advisable, to attempt to appoint or
elect leaders for Negroes. Naturally men and women of exceptional powers
will be recognized by those of less developed powers as leaders of thought
in various connections in their several localities.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_506' name='Page_506' href='#Page_506'>506</a></span>
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. There should be no recognized leaders of Negroes except those who are
selected from groups or bodies of Negroesâ€”selected by them for a particular
purpose or a particular cause. I do not believe in Negro leadership secured
by members of the white race and then handed to our group as a leader without
first having had the endorsement of the Negroes themselves.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. Yes. Emmet Scott, Dr. Du Bois and Mr. Grimke. Mr. Scott has great
executive ability. Dr. Du Bois is a great philosopher and an ardent race
rights advocate. Mr. Grimke a scholar and wise counsellor. This combination
as Leaders' Council would, in my opinion, conserve our best interests.
Mr. Scott is too much of an opportunist for an ideal leader, Dr. Du Bois is
too radical at times, Mr. Grimke is too much of an intellectual recluse.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. There should be recognized leaders of Negroes, recognized by Negroes because
of their merits in their particular fields of endeavor. There are Negroes
qualified for such leadership today, but their affiliations with organizations
largely or partly supported by philanthropic whites negative their usefulness.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. I believe every community should develop its own leadership. A great deal
of our present leadership is too largely clerical and political and therefore not
free, broad, and independent. We need a leadership which is free, courageous,
and which possesses a program and definite objective.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. I do not approve self-appointed leadership or leadership bestowed by white
friends because they can command funds. If there are to be leaders, they
should be chosen by selection so that there can be "solemn referendum."
With this qualification, there are a large number of Negroes whom I would
vote for as leaders. The trouble now is that our so-called leaders are not
responsible to those whom they are supposed to represent.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. There should not be; as soon as one appears, destructive influences are
brought to bear upon him both from within and without, making of him
within a short period an extremely artificial and useless guide, but who is
followed, nevertheless, by Negroes blindly to their own great injury.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. I believe firmly in the capacity of the race for self-leadership. Any people
can govern themselves better than an outsider is apt to govern them, unless
the alien is willing to become naturalized in the group he aspires to lead.
The white race at present is unable or unwilling to become naturalized in the
Negro group.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. The basis of Negro leadership should rest on the ability to develop within
the masses a desire and the power to obtain better homes, education and their
privileges as citizens without belittling themselves or adopting the toadying
attitude. Any individual who is striving in a community to secure these
things for his people should be considered a leader. The mere ability to
write a book, edit a magazine, or publicly express the cause of the Negro is
not a sufficient qualification for leadership even though it does bring national
prominence.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
13. (<i>a</i>) Under the circumstances, yes. (<i>b</i>) Useless to discuss this. People
usually choose as their leaders those who express most strongly prevailing
sentiments. (<i>c</i>) The followers are their own judges of merit and demerit.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: What, in your opinion, are some of the greatest mistakes of prominent
Negroes in their policies or stand on racial issues?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_507' name='Page_507' href='#Page_507'>507</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. Most are honest, I think, but emphasize too much some one pet solution,
such as "Get Property," "Industrial Education," etc. Many are insincere,
using their influence to feather their own nests, letting the race go hang.
An intolerance among Negroes themselves for those among their number
who have different opinions as to the wisest courses in arriving at the better
conditions which they equally are trying to bring about. Some characteristics
possessed by most of the so-called leaders may be summed as follows:
</p>

<p class="i2">
Don't bother and leave all in the hands of God.
</p>

<p class="i2">
Overestimation of the Negroes' present attainments, eulogies instead of
information.
</p>

<p class="i2">
Oratory of denunciation only, raising prejudice against whites but
offering no course of action or thought leading to improvement either of
Negroes personally or individually, or as a race.
</p>

<p class="i2">
A disinclination to tell the blunt truth when interracial conferences offer
the opportunity for an exchange of views.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. The greatest mistake that leaders usually make is that of failing to study the
problems towards the solution of which they are working. They also are
not willing to co-operate with leaders along other lines.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. Selfishness and lack of moral backbone in the face of possible financial loss.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. To accept that there is a purely racial psychology. And to think, act, or
accept as a Negro and not as a man.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. (<i>a</i>) Compromising attitude; (<i>b</i>) depending on support of white people financially
and morally; (<i>c</i>) failure to co-operate freely with all cases among the
Negroes themselves.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. Lack of absolute frankness with white people about mind and feeling of
Negroes; lack of absolute frankness with Negroes about their own shortcomings
and failure. I believe that many men are overcoming this weakness.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. Short-sightedness. They seem not to look ahead and see the consequence
of their arrangements and concessions. Most of them, because of the manner
of their selections, are unacquainted with history, sociology, etc. They see
the present, not even the present generation. They fall into advices and
concessions today which prove a noose tomorrow. There is lack of poise.
Often they seem to know nothing of a means. There is no intermediate
ground; it simply is or it is not. This absolutism inevitably leads to trouble.
This of course does not apply to all of our leaders.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. The greatest mistakes of prominent Negroes in their stands: A statesman is
supposed to be the fusion of two necessary elements: (1) the theorist, such
as we have in our college professors and most of our writers; and (2) the
practical politician who can get things done. The main fault with most of
our prominent Negroes in their policies and behavior is that they never
accomplish this fusion; all fall very definitely into either group one or group
two, and either group by itself is helpless.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. The greatest mistake of prominent Negroes, in my judgment, is that they pay
too great a deference to the attitude of the white race rather than to the
inherent demands of humanity. Jesus refused to defer to the arrogance of
Pilate, although he exercised the power of life or death.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_508' name='Page_508' href='#Page_508'>508</a></span>
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. Faulty perspective due to improper training; failure to grasp the economic
significance of race prejudice; and a tendency to preach the doctrine of non-resistance
when they get rich and fat. The younger crop of Negroes, armed
with modern scientific education are remedying the first two. Time will
show whether they will prove more unselfish.
</p>
</div>

<h5>
DEFENSIVE PHILOSOPHY
</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: If it may be assumed that there are conditions which are intolerable, or,
at least, a constant source of irritation to Negroes, it is to be expected that
some defensive philosophy is necessary to give poise, dignity, and self-respect.
What is your philosophy? What basic philosophical considerations,
even if not crystallized into dogma, support your outlook on life, or
that of Negroes of your acquaintance and general point of view?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. I believe racial solidarity, as I conceive it, to be the defensive philosophy of
many Negroes. My own philosophy, if I have one, is summed up in the
belief that potentially the Negro has the same qualities making for success
and usefulness as any other group. All he needs is an even break. I believe
in an offensive program to teach pride in their achievements and prepare
themselves for keen, hard competition all along the line. I believe in
attacking the indifference and ignorance of white people which is largely the
basis of prejudice, by educating them to respect and believe in the self-defending,
non-favor-asking, justice-demanding Negro.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. My philosophy rests upon two propositions. The first is borrowed from the
Latin "I am a man; nothing human is foreign to me." The second is: A
man is entirely the product of his environment. (Heredity is the sum of our
former environments.) Given, then, an essential equality in all men,
temporary advantages are the results of environment. Self-preservation
and its corollary, the desire for the preservation of species, are fundamental
traits, and the Israelites, killing those who said Sibboleth and not Shibboleth,
have their prototype in those who make non-conformity in hair,
color, speech or culture, a crime and inferiority stamp. It seems rational
to suppose, however, that man may evolve sufficient mentality, and far
enough away from the brute, to make differences in culture and not physical
characteristics the basis of distinctions. Until then the pursuit of pleasure
and advantage is the proper aim of life.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. The Negro maintains his self-respect and dignity in the face of intolerable
conditions because of his natural optimism and his hope for and belief in
the approach of a better day. I teach my children that they should not
seek companionship with any other children who reluctantly associate with
them, not that my children should consider themselves in any way inferior
or unequal, but that they should be possessed of too much personal pride to
wish association with those who would not be pleasant and agreeable.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. My philosophy is a pessimistic one. There is often a sense of hopelessness.
To live in the white group makes it incumbent on me to overcome many
presumptions on their part. On the other hand, to create mutual understandability
is a phase of aggressive conduct I follow. To conduct one's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_509' name='Page_509' href='#Page_509'>509</a></span>
self in a more socially acceptable way, viz., to do a certain thing better than
any member of the dominant group, is another excellent mode of enhancing
social values. But the best way of all is to assume an offensive attack, and
place the white group or individual on the defensive at all times. This can
be accomplished only by a superior type of mind.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. Never submit passively to unnecessary indignities. Keep alive the spirit
of protest against all injustice from black or white. I am just as good or at
least my right to decent treatment is as good as that of any other man. I
am what I think and do, not what some other person does to me or thinks
about me.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. My experience with the segregation tendency has taught me to look down
upon the system. It bristles with contradictions, being foolishly fastidious,
fanatically unreasonable, and usually carried out by the uncultured element.
Moreover, the promoters of the system are not ready to discuss the matter;
it is simply taboo. The immoral forays of members of this super-sensitive
"superior race" coupled with criminal economical advantages maintained by
intimidation aside from being tragic lends a subtle hypocrisy which does not
escape even the casual observer. Add to this the hysteria of the thing and
you have a medley of the ludicrous hypocritical, illogical, and hysterical.
Any man then who is honest and self-respecting easily comes to feel himself
superior to the promoters of the institutions. One moves among these
conditions with a feeling probably not unlike that of Socrates among the
Athenians, although, if he chances to be a man of color, with far less freedom
of conduct and speech.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. My philosophy would be that by our conduct as a group we will be able to
disprove the principles upon which the white man's intolerance is based; we
should assert our rights and use propaganda to change the white man's point
of view civically, morally and in the economic world.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. I am firmly convinced that a dignified friendly attitude towards the white
race is the wisest course for the Negro: education, industry, and good manners
will win for us more real tolerance and consideration than continued
agitation and bitterness. Truth and justice will demand fair play in time,
and sentiment must be molded by appeal to intelligence and finer sentiments
through undisputable facts.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. Cultivate a wholesome discontent with untoward conditions and use every
lawful means to improve these conditions, so that it may not be said that we
are satisfied with unjust discriminations. "The talent for misery is the
fulcrum of progress."
</p>
</div>

<h5>
SEGREGATION AND RACIAL SOLIDARITY
</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: What, to your mind, is the distinction, either in point of view or definite
racial aim, between segregation and "racial solidarity"?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. Segregation implies coercion by the dominant group. Racial solidarity
implies certain subjective tendencies of like-mindedness. Racial solidarity
may be enhanced by segregation but it thrives best if its causes have their
roots in the will to progress rather than the will to exist amidst oppression.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_510' name='Page_510' href='#Page_510'>510</a></span>
Though segregation may aid the tendency toward racial solidarity, neither
segregation nor racial solidarity are to be advised in a modern civilization.
Racial solidarity for protective reasons with strong limitations (never legal)
may be advisable today in America.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. The definite racial aim of segregation is to prevent the contact of races physically;
to prevent Negroes from living with the whites in their neighborhoods
and vice versa; to keep themselves separate as a group, thus making segregation
of schools and other institutions a natural sequence. Whereas, the aim of
racial solidarity is to focus the financial, economic, political and social
strength of the group for the purpose of meeting the attacks of the white
race as well as for the solution of group problems; for example, solid
financial strength would mean Negro business houses of every description,
banks, etc.; it would mean that the race as a unit would withdraw its patronage
and support from any institution or business that discriminated against
members of their group; they would boycott as a unit any brand of goods
made by a firm dealing unjustly with colored patrons, etc. It means that
politically the group would throw its strength to the party whose principles
are in harmony with the welfare of the Negro.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. Segregation presupposes a force from without which seeks to compel those
of the same race or nationality or religious belief to remain among themselves,
separated from those of another group supposedly superior. Grouping
together either for purposes of living or of religious worship or for other purposes,
with the idea of developing a group or race consciousness and thus to
develop "pride of race," presupposes a force from withinâ€”that is a conscious
desire of the people themselves to develop the latent powers within their
own group through intensive application.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. Negroes tend to flock together as do members of other racial groups. I do
not regard this as segregation. When an effort is made from without to group
them together, which carries along with it restrictions of movement, residence
or activity, we have segregation. Racial solidarity seems to me to be the
conscious or unconscious reaction to segregation. It is a doctrine of revolt.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. Segregation means to me regulation of racial contacts by law or force between
white and colored people. Racial solidarity is a natural development of
massing because of race congeniality.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. Segregation and racial solidarity differ fundamentally and essentially in
the motive prompting the individual act to be discussed. Segregation is
the forcing apart of any group into a less favorable environment in order that
advantage or position may accrue to those in authority. Race solidarity represents
the active part in the same rÃ´le, and is the effort of individuals to utilize
similarity of aims or of situation as the basis of an offensive or defensive alliance.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. Racial segregation is harmful as a social aim. Racial segregation is the
result of the attempt of a more powerful group to impose its ideas of racial
inferiority upon a weaker group. The weaker group in its attempt to defeat
this program rightly adopts racial solidarity as a definite aim in order to
strengthen itself both to resist discrimination which usually follows segregation
and to attack the vicious and narrow-minded motives of proponents of
racial segregation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_511' name='Page_511' href='#Page_511'>511</a></span>
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. Voluntary segregation is a step, consciously or unconsciously taken, toward
racial solidarity.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. It seems to me that segregation and racial solidarity differ in that the latter
is merely a mental attitude whereas the former, though it includes a certain
mental attitude, is chiefly characterized by a sort of hysterical physical
separation. Racial solidarity obviously can exist among groups separated
by considerable distance, as among Jews. When the mental attitude is not,
or is felt not to be, adequate to effect the desired separation among races,
then a sort of hysteria ensues and separation is one of the forms in which this
hysteria expresses itself. On the whole we may have reason to doubt its
efficacy, for it bears a relation to race solidarity akin to that which legal
restraint bears to moral restraint.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
It seems probable that both racial solidarity and segregation aim at
the same thing. Segregation, it seems to me, in the long run must prove a
poor means to the end, and it would not require a very imaginative person
to think that in its crass forms it may destroy the very end it aims to achieve
by creating a prejudice of a violent and consuming sort.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. The term "segregation" in current discussion connotes legal compulsion,
whereas "racial solidarity" implies voluntary union of the colored group
under the compulsion of internal feeling or social influences.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. Segregation, either voluntary or forced, is purely an objective situation, a
setting apart in a definite location from one's fellows. Racial solidarity is
subjective and is the feeling of cohesion between persons of the same race.
Segregation is undoubtedly a factor in intensifying this feeling of the consciousness
of kind.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. The distinction between segregation and "racial solidarity" is in a point of
view, viz.: racial solidarity concerns the interior of the Negro, his psychosis,
as to its inclusion of a cohesive spirit; segregation concerns the exterior of the
Negro, is looking at the situation from the viewpoint of the whites and relates
to the barriers opposed by the whites to his unlimited expansion. Voluntary
segregation may seem to point to the mind and viewpoint of the Negro
rather than the whites, but voluntary segregation does not become a practical
problem until the whites attempt to use it as a precedent, in which case it
becomes after all a matter of the viewpoint of the whites.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
13. It would appear that there is a very fundamental difference between segregation
and racial solidarity as the terms are now used in the United States
relative to the Negro. By racial solidarity it is generally understood that
there is some sort of a physical separation which has been decreed by a law,
as for example: the various residential segregation laws enacted some years
ago and the segregation laws relative to the separation of races in public
conveyances, etc. Racial solidarity, it may be said, is largely volitional,
whereas segregation, as the term now is generally used, has back of it an
enacted law or the idea of having an enacted law.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
A still more fundamental distinction is that racial solidarity does not
turn upon the receiving of benefits from privileges or things that are for all
the public; segregation, on the other hand, has to do almost exclusively with
the restriction of privileges relating to the free use of things that are for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_512' name='Page_512' href='#Page_512'>512</a></span>
all the public, as for example, the free use of public conveyances, public
places, the establishing of residences, etc.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
14. Segregation aims to herd Negroes together in order that they may be cheated
of the rights of citizenship the more easily. Racial solidarity urges Negroes
to get together in order that they may fight segregation the more effectively.
"National solidarity" is, to our thinking, a far better weapon. Negroes
should endeavor to find out those whites who are their friends and ask them
to join in the fight for the enforcement of the Constitution.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: A large number of Negroes are in agreement on the matter of separate
colored churches with colored pastors, and, more recently, colored bishops.
Yet this is an argument used by many exponents of the segregation idea,
both whole and partial, for other separate institutions. Candidly, what is
your opinion on the subject?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. Separate churches, etc., are but a part of the system of segregation inherent
in the social fabric of America. This question is therefore not fundamental
or basic enough. As a matter of logic and sociological analysis, since I do
not favor legal or customary segregation, I cannot favor separate churches,
which are but a reflex of enforced segregation. Therefore I do not favor
other separate institutions. Yet, I at all times favor free assemblage and
organization whatever the social system is or may be. If separate institutions
are "desired" by the group and this "want" is not cramped by such
considerations as factors like American public opinion, then separate institutions
are in order. The test is the free and unimpaired development of the
group.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. The "colored" church is itself an anomaly. The very idea is logically ridiculous.
From the practical standpoint it is the result of the un-Christian
attitude of churches which preceded it and largely brought it into being.
If I had to join a church now, I hope I should decide according to the doctrines
and tenets rather than according to the race of the pastor and communicants.
If any consideration should guide me rather than the doctrines,
it would be to go where I could do the most good.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. The idea of using the fact of the Negro's preference for his own church,
governed by its own ministry, as a reason for segregation not only is absurd
but is a weak reason for the manifestation of race prejudice. That Negroes
prefer to be together in religious worship is a well-established fact; that they
wish their church to be governed by their own ministers and bishops is equally
well established; that such desire is natural and human, one must admit; but
that this perfectly normal desire should become a reason for forcing upon the
Negro other separate institutions is not justifiable. There is a fine distinction
between the performance of one's religious rites and the activities necessary
to maintain and foster these (which becomes social in character), and the
business arrangements of getting an education, being conveyed somewhere,
buying a meal, or paying to hear a world-famed artist. The former is part
of one's private life and as such is a matter of choice and should be confined
to those who are closest to him by race and spiritual conception. The latter
are affairs of business wherein one wishes something and pays for it; and as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_513' name='Page_513' href='#Page_513'>513</a></span>
long as he has the necessary greenback, expects to be accorded the rights and
courtesies given any citizen of the city or state. The French, the Italian,
nearly every nationality, have their own churches, their own ministers, and
worship in their own tongue. But no one ever hears anything about segregating
the Frenchman or the Italian for that reason.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. The latter plan, racial solidarity, is not at all inconsistent with the spirit of
democracy even when it means the development of separate colored churches
or the appointment of colored bishops for colored churches in the denominations
where the color line is not so sharply drawn.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. In my opinion, the Negroes as a whole are not in harmony and agreement on
colored churches as such. It is a condition that has been pushed upon them;
a means to the end. If Negroes were treated just as any other member of a
white church, and given the same opportunity to advance to positions of
honor within the church, ministers, priests, bishops, etc., regardless of color,
there would be no Negro churches.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
6. It is this universal spirit which causes Negroes to desire Negro churches
and Negro bishops, because the dominant minds can more easily secure
advantages when in an environment in which they conform to the majority
pattern and are not parts of a clearly differentiated minority.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
7. Separate colored churches in some degree are necessary in order to build up
racial solidarity as described above. In other words, a strong defensive many
times makes for an effective offensive.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
8. Separate colored churches have never seemed to me to be necessary.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
9. I am convinced that a limited race separation is not only desirable but
unavoidable. There is a wide stretch of possibilities between absolute segregation
and unlimited social communication. To argue that because Negroes
have and want ministers and teachers of their own color, therefore they should
want absolute segregation, strikes me as a bit absurd. There are at least
two justifications: it may be thought that the Negro ministers and teachers
understand our racial aspirations better and can better impart instructions
leading to a realization of them.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
10. Wherever Negroes find themselves segregated in schools and churches by
choice or control, they should have teachers, preachers and overseers of their
own race. Long distance leadership is neither desirable nor effective. This
leadership will acquire requisite efficiency by survival of the fittest.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
11. The motivation of any separate institutions should be the basis of its approval
or disapproval. If Negroes of their own volition develop Negro churches,
banks, clubs, stores or other organizations as a means of developing enterprise
or initiative, or for providing better opportunities of work for young men
and women of our race, I am in accord with such separation. If, however,
such separation is forced on them especially in public places, such as hotels,
restaurants, theaters and railroads, a separation which sets the Negro apart
from the general public, I believe it should be condemned and fought against.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
12. It is argued that if many of our leading Negroes agree upon the expediency
of complete racial separation in church life, they are inconsistent in not
applying it to all matters concerning the Negro. The answer to this is as
follows: The highest end of the Negro is the same as that of the man of any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_514' name='Page_514' href='#Page_514'>514</a></span>
other race, viz.: complete self-expression and development of his individuality;
in deciding upon what he shall accept or reject in any case this
must be his guiding principle; between being a nonentity in the "white"
church and partially expressing himself in a Negro church, he naturally
chooses the latter, choosing it not as the <i>summun bonum</i>, but solely as the
lesser of two evils; between having the Negro officers in the world war and
having Negro officers who are trained in a separate camp, he considers
the latter less injurious. But give the Negro a choice between a separate
church where only partial self-expression can be possible, and a "white"
church which would give him full opportunity for individual expression,
and he would not hesitate a moment in choosing such a "white" church.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
13. Separate colored churches, colored pastors and colored bishops represent
more or less a voluntary action of colored people and are indicative of racial
solidarity in just the same way as Jewish churches having Jewish rabbis
represent Jewish solidarity.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
14. As a slave the Negro was welcome to worship at the white church. As a
citizen he is not. The white church is a semi-public institution, being more
social than religious in its tone. Since Negroes are not wanted, their only
recourse is to have their own churches. And if their own churches, why a
white pastor or bishop, when Negro preachers quite as competent can be
found?

OPINION-MAKING
</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="tdh">
<i>Question</i>: On what instruments ordinarily responsible for the making of public
opinion do you rely for your opinions? With what reservations do you
accept what you read in the white press? To what degree are you influenced
by the opinions of colored persons?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p class="tdh">
1. Of course I read daily papers, magazines and books and attend lectures and
seek every possible means to learn the trend of thought and philosophy of
life as it develops throughout civilization. However, whenever the Negro
question is treated, I always approach with suspicion the arguments presented
by white people. I always read expressions forecasting the approach
of democracy with the knowledge that but few white writers and speakers
think of the colored races in their utterances. The colored newspapers are
much more fair than the whites, but even they, at times, are inclined to
bias.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
2. Magazines, colored and white papers, public speakers. I accept with great
reservation what I read in the white press. I am influenced to a small degree
by the opinions of the colored papers.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
3. The daily papers, the <i>Nation</i>, the <i>New Republic</i>, the <i>Crisis</i>, the <i>Messenger</i>,
the <i>Literary Digest</i>, the <i>Socialist Review</i>, the colored papers, and other
scattered organs from here, there and everywhere. The dependence I put
upon these white papers is hard to state in words. If in a white paper I
see something favorable to the Negro on a question of fact, I take it at face
value. On questions of opinion, I draw my own conclusions from my own
study and experience, wherever possible. Likewise in a colored paper I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_515' name='Page_515' href='#Page_515'>515</a></span>
take at face value on a question of fact anything favorable to the white view.
Otherwise I draw my own conclusions.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
4. (<i>a</i>) Daily papers, lectures and magazines. (<i>b</i>) Always with reservations on
any subject, especially on race records. (<i>c</i>) Not very much outside of a few
good magazines.
</p>

<p class="tdh">
5. Every article in white or Negro press is read with the idea that the bias of
the writer must be discounted and that the conclusions cannot be accepted,
but that one's conclusions must be made from the aggregate of the facts
gleaned from every available source bearing upon the subject under
discussion.

</p>
</div>

<p>
6. Newspapers, magazines, legislative action, personal contacts. The white
press will always justify suspicion and the traditional grain of salt with
reference to its news concerning Negroes. White news reporters know
too few actual facts about Negroes and are too hemmed about by traditional
prejudices to be reliable news gatherers in this field. Colored newspapers
are, in my opinion, becoming increasingly more reliable in their expression
of the thoughts and mind of Negroes, although many times they suffer from
the same disease with reference to white people which besets white reporters.
</p>

<p>
7. History and observation. I habitually question unfavorable comment,
because the prejudice and the training of the writers must be considered.
Colored papers, unless paid to do otherwise, are more likely to exaggerate
reports favorable to the Negro. Therefore some reservations must be
made on account of the prejudice and the lack of training of many of the
writers.
</p>

<p>
8. I believe that the information I get from the instruments ordinarily responsible
for public opinion influences my opinion but little at any particular moment.
I seem to have a theory of present-day tendencies in American institutions
with reference to the Negro, and I accept items from these instruments merely
as confirmations or negations of my opinions. Usually the negations are
so few and far between that I can look upon them as sports or the "exception
that proves the rule." Perhaps the <i>Crisis</i> figures most prominently in forming
my opinion. At least when my opinion is formed, I am unable to account
for it by any small number of books, or other publications. I read regularly
the <i>New York Age</i>, the <i>Negro World</i>, and from time to time many other Negro
newspapers; I read the <i>Crisis</i>, the <i>Messenger</i>, the <i>Century</i>, <i>Review of Reviews</i>,
<i>World's Work</i>, <i>Outlook</i>, <i>Independent</i>, and various scientific articles bearing on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_516' name='Page_516' href='#Page_516'>516</a></span>
the Negro and such reviews of an even larger number of articles as appear in
the <i>Psychological Bulletin</i> and similar publications from time to time.
</p>

<p>
Nearly always when I read, the white press items concerning the Negro
are looked upon as carefully selected and shaped for propaganda. By a
careful and studied system of emphasis and omission such items can be
made to prove most any point. There are exceptions, such as the <i>Independent</i>
editorials, etc. Colored newspapers influence my opinion little
directly. The items of real news are accepted at face value, there being no
appeal, and these are referred to a more or less stable theory of the situation.
The theory changes so gradually that I am unable to tell what items exert
the greatest influence.
</p>

<p>
9. I read the dailies and the <i>Crisis</i>, <i>Messenger</i> and <i>Amsterdam News</i>. I accept
what all of them say with great reservation, though I naturally give more
credence to report of Negro topics in Negro papers than in white papers.
</p>

<p>
10. I regret to say that the Christian church and the religious press, which should
be the chief reliance in shaping public opinion in the moral direction, are
all but negligible factors. More race prejudice will be shown in Chicago
in the churches on next Sunday morning than in the schools on the following
Monday. Religion failing, the chief reliance for the present must be upon
the secular agencies such as science, politics, trade, business and the public
press and platform. The Negro himself must shape and direct righteous
public opinion. Moral reform comes through the public, who feel the need
of it. The Negro press is greatly hampered by restrictive and controlling
influences, but on the whole it is, perhaps, the most righteous voice in
America now crying in the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
11. I rely on books, magazines and newspapers for facts on which to base opinions.
With the exception of a few weeklies, and a few radical newspapers and magazines,
I believe the white press is hostile towards the Negro. Whatever I
read concerning him, in the daily papers especially, I take with a grain of salt.
In matters of race problems the Negro papers usually present the facts of the
case fairly. I am inclined to accept their views about such matters. Their
opinions about other phases of life, in which race is not predominant concern,
I take also with a grain of salt or not at all.
</p>

<p>
12. Personally we rely on facts, not opinions. Hardly anything in the white
press regarding Negroes is to be believed. It rarely, if ever, mentions
good about Negroes. The white press is the chief instrument used for fostering
the exploitations of Negroes. Most of the news is cooked and doctored
to fan race hatred. A few white editors would perhaps write more fairly were
they free. Personally very little. Nearly every Negro newspaper that we
know, though, aims sincerely to benefit Negroes. While the judgment of
the Negro editor is often at fault, his heart is honest. It is infinitely
safer for Negroes to accept the judgment of a Negro editor than that of
a white one.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: Specifically what constitutes the offensiveness in the manner in which the
subject "Negro" is handled in some of the local white papers and what sensitive
spots do these methods of handling touch?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_517' name='Page_517' href='#Page_517'>517</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Answers</i>:
</p>

<p>
1. There is a suggestion of inferiority and degradation in the usual handling
of the subject "Negro" by the local white papers; they generally use the
subject in connection with something evil or unlovely; seldom discussed
with credit or praise. This affects race honor, race pride, and race love.
</p>

<p>
2. Withholding the titles Miss and Mrs. from the names of colored women.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="i2">

Crime headlines, parading Negro crime and criminals.
</p>

<p class="i2">
Printing misstatements of facts but not the denials of them.
</p>

<p class="i2">
Continual suggestions of "proper limitations upon Negro activity"
along lines innocent where other races are concerned.
</p>

<p class="i2">
A patronizing attitude toward the Negro and his activities.
</p>
</div>

<p>
3. I detest the use of the word "Negro" as it is spelled with a small <i>n</i>. I shrink
from the feminine "Negress." "A colored American" is not distasteful to
me at any time.
</p>

<p>
4. The realization that an inferior man whose face is white can, by appealing to
white racial consciousness, outstrip his superior by the utilization of mass
cohesion. My feeling is one of thwarted ambition rather than offended sensibilities.
</p>

<p>
5. Spelling of "Negro" with a small <i>n</i>.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="i2">
Negro caricaturesâ€”always a joke and easily handled.
</p>

<p class="i2">
The Negro as criminal is the general view.
</p>

<p class="i2">
Nothing said about the Negro on the progressive side.
</p>

<p class="i2">
Negro naturally inferior. I need only refer to the Harding episode.
</p>
</div>

<p>
6. The assumption that all Negroes are intellectually and morally inferior. The
implication that certain crimes are peculiar to the Negro. The application
of opprobrious epithets, so common in some papers. The statement that
the race is satisfied with the treatment it receives in public places.
</p>

<p>
7. Undue prominence and emphasis upon the social aspect of news which is
purely personal. Evident failure to obtain or give expression to the Negro
point of view.
</p>

<p>
8. The tendency in my community to connect the Negro in public print with
some offensive or boorish or irresponsibly humorous incident is the most
annoying use of the word "Negro." By careful emphasis and omissions, the
word "Negro" comes to be associated with irresponsible, apish, or silly conduct
on the one hand or criminality on the other.
</p>

<p>
9. Among the other things I take offense at the way the local white papers cannot
report crimes committed by Negroes without a big headline, often on the
front page, stating that "Brutal Negro Commits Outrage"; I object to the
use of the word "Negress," to spelling Negro with a small <i>n</i>; and particularly
I object to the sins of omission of these newspapers in that they never attempt
any news which may construct better relations, e.g., such as could be obtained
if they secured on their reportorial staff an intelligent Negro who knew the
needs and aspirations of his people. My sensitiveness upon this results from
two things: (1) it wounds my self-respect, and (2) I hate to see race struggle
consciously and effectively fomented by the powerful press.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_518' name='Page_518' href='#Page_518'>518</a></span>
</p>

<p>
10. The white race as a whole seems to disregard the just sensibilities of the Negro
race, and does not scruple to use offensive terms and epithets which would be
violently resented by any other group of American citizens. I have no objection
to the term Negro used in a descriptive sense for the entire racial group.
</p>

<p>
11. The word Negro is still printed in many papers with a small <i>n</i>. A general
attitude to ridicule Negroes is sometimes evident. Recently a baby contest
was held in New York in which there were entered several Negro babes;
some of them took prizes. One paper spoke of them as "dusky belles."
Very often when a colored woman is mentioned in the papers it is written in
this manner: "Katherine Jones, a negress." The recent discussion of
Senator Harding's lineage showed that most of the papers considered it a
"vile and contemptuous slander"; the possession of Negro blood seemed to
be a polluting element which could only mean degradation.
</p>

<p>
12. The word Negro is wrong, altogether. Prejudice is the only reason for its
use. Capitalizing might help, but does it modify the treatment?
</p>
</div>

<p>
The editor of the <i>Crisis</i>, whose opinions are read by millions of Negroes,
was one of the five Negroes living outside of Chicago to whom the foregoing
questions were put. He sensed in them an insidious attempt to make Negroes
confess that they preferred ill treatment, riots, segregation by proscription,
and Negro Ghettos. Acting upon this conviction, he warned the Negroes of
the country to watch the white members of this Commission. The article is
given as it appeared in the January 1921 issue of the <i>Crisis</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>
</p>

<p>
We would advise our Chicago friends to watch narrowly the work and forthcoming
report of the Interracial Commission appointed by the Governor of Illinois after
the late riot. The Commission consists of colored men who apparently have a much
too complacent trust in their white friends; of white men who are too busy to know;
and of enemies of the Negro race who under the guise of impartiality and good will
are pushing insidiously but unswervingly a program of racial segregation. They
have, for instance, sent a "questionnaire" to prominent colored men, consisting of
fifteen questions, which with all their surface frankness and innocence seek to betray
black folk by means of the logical dilemma of "segregation" and racial "solidarity."
By subtle suggestion these queries say: If you believe in colored churches, why not
in colored ghettos? Does not Negro advancement increase anti-Negro hatred?
Are not Negroes prejudiced against whites? Are not the mistakes of Negro leaders
manifest? And so on.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, if a professed enemy of black folk and their progress had set out to start
a controversy so as to divide the Negroes and their friends in counsel and throw the
whole burden of such hasty outbreaks of race hate as the East St. Louis, Washington,
and Chicago riots upon them, he would have framed just such a questionnaire as
has been sent out by this Commission.

At the time of this article the Commission had made no report of its findings
whatever, and there was no possible basis for the accusation of bias. When
a Negro living in Chicago explained that the questionnaire was prepared by a
Negro member of the Commission's staff, the editor of the <i>Crisis</i> replied that
"whoever framed the questionnaire of which I speak in the <i>Crisis</i> or advised
its framing had a bias against Negroes. Of that I have not the slightest
doubt, and what I was doing was simply to warn the public of this bias."

<h3>
I. THE PRESS
</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We cannot escape the conclusion that the press is the most powerful institution in
this country. It can make men, it can destroy men. It can conduct crusades; it
can put an end to crusades. It can create propaganda; it can stifle propaganda. It
can subvert the Government; it can practically uphold the Government. It is at
once the most powerful agency for good in the United States and the most dangerous
institution known under our system of Government. More than all this, despite theoretical
laws which restrain abuses of the Press, so determined are the American people
that its freedom shall not be abridged that they have written into the Constitution
of the United States (Amend. I) the express provision that "Congress shall make no
law ... abridging the freedom ... of the press," and in practice the Press is
free to destroy men, institutions and races, or to make them live, the power being
limited only by the conscience and sagacity of the men who compose this powerful
Fourth Estate.

Sound opinions depend always upon accurate statements of facts. Upon
the objective information which the press is supposed to provide, the public
depends to guide its thinking. If the information source is polluted, pollution
may be expected in the opinions based upon it. When the public is
deluded by distortions of fact, one-sided presentations, exaggerations, and
interpretations of fact controlled by definite policies of whatever sort, a situation
is created which will inevitably accomplish great damage.
</p>

<p>
Race relations are at all times dependent upon the public opinion of the
community. Considering the great number of delicate issues involved, the
careful handling of this kind of news is a question of great concern and has
been the subject of much comment and criticism both by Negroes and whites.
These criticisms are frequent and vehement. Negroes in Chicago almost without
exception point to the Chicago press as the responsible agent for many of
their present difficulties. Throughout the country it is pointed out by both
whites and Negroes that the policies of newspapers on racial matters have made
relations more difficult, at times fostering new antagonism and enmities
and even precipitating riots by inflaming the public against Negroes. For
example, the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, in its
report on the church and social work, makes this comment: "We observe also
with regret and deep concern ... the continuing incitement to riot by
certain public officials and periodicals, especially the partisan press with its
misrepresentation and inflaming spirit."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_521' name='Page_521' href='#Page_521'>521</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Said the <i>Survey</i> magazine, May 15, 1920: "The custom of newspapers to
ridicule the efforts of colored people is a gratuitous insult that they have to
meet on every hand."
</p>

<p>
The <i>New Republic</i> observes editorially: "Race riots within a week of one
another occurred in Washington and Chicago.... The press made a race
question of individual crime, and the mob, led by marines and soldiers, took
up the issue which the press had presented to them."
</p>

<p>
Negroes are loud in their condemnation of the press throughout the country.
Says one Negro newspaper:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Whatever be the cause of the motive, there is apparently a well-organized plan
to discredit the race in America and to bring estrangement between fellow-Americans.
A short-sighted ... press is contributing to this estrangement by playing upon the
passions of the undiscriminating, and thoughtlessly, by its glaring and sensational
headlines, emphasizing rumors of alleged crimes by Negroes.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Associated Negro Press accuses the Associated Press of fostering ill
feeling and hatred between whites and Negroes. It says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Associated Press (white) ... always in its first paragraph ... attributes
the source of trouble to our people "molesting white women." That, the Associated
Press knows, is always fuel for the fire of the fury.... It arouses certain
elements of whites to indignation by the thoughts of the ever "burly black brutes,"
and it stirs the people of our group to a state of fighting, mad by the folly of it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Philadelphia Tribune</i>, a Negro paper, said: "Daily papers keep up
mob sentiment. They continue to fan the riot flames into a destructive blaze."
</p>

<p>
The method of news handling now in practice in the Chicago Press, white
and Negro, appears to contribute in effect to strained relations between the
races. This condition prompts a more than casual inquiry into these methods.
</p>

<p>
A few examples will illustrate. On the night of July 20, 1920, following
the demonstration of a group of Negro fanatics, the self-styled
"Abyssinians," a prominent newspaper printed in large headlines: "Race
Riotâ€”Two Whites Slain." The paper was an extra and widely distributed.
At Sixty-third and Halsted streets four Negro ministers returning from a
church conference in Gary, Indiana, were set upon by a mob of whites who had
merely read the report, and were beaten unmercifully.
</p>

<p>
On January 23, 1920, the following article appeared in the <i>Chicago Herald-Examiner</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Students Defy Negro Teacher</span>
<br />
Pupils' Strike Starts at Altgeld School over Substitute;
<br />
Parents Support Them
</p>

<p>
A revolt which threatened to require settlement by the Board of Education
developed yesterday in the eighth grade of the Altgeld School, Seventy-first and
Loomis streets. Two of the pupils have been suspended, others threaten a general
walkout. Pickets are to be established about the school today, several students
promised tonight to urge a general strike. The regular teacher was ill with influenza
yesterday.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_522' name='Page_522' href='#Page_522'>522</a></span>
</p>

<p class="center">
PUT NEGRO GIRL IN CHARGE
</p>

<p>
The only available substitute was a Negro girl, Effie Stewart, normal graduate
and accredited eighth-grade instructor. She was taken to the schoolroom by Principal
J. W. Brooks and given charge. As the principal left pandemonium broke loose.
Disregarding the efforts of the teacher to restore calm, several of the boys arose and
harangued the class to ignore the substitute. Half a dozen of the pupils left the room.
</p>

<p class="center">
REFUSE TO OBEY HER
</p>

<p>
The teacher directed one of the pupils, Paul Brissono, to summon Principal Brooks
to the room. Paul flatly refused. He walked out and reported the trouble to his
parents at 1406 West Seventy-third Street. Genevieve Lindy, 6744 Laflin Street,
next was told to go to the Principal's office for help. She declined and went home.
Principal Brooks ordered both pupils suspended. He said the facts would be placed
before the district superintendent, John A. Long. In the meantime many of the
parents of eighth-grade pupils took a stand supporting their children.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Commission sent investigators to check up the facts as a thorough test
of a report which most whites believed and most Negroes did not believe.
The Negro teacher in question, the school principal, the superintendent of
schools, and some of the parents of white children in the school were interviewed.
The following is the result of the Commission's investigation:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>a</i>) Every item noted by the press in this case was contradicted by the principal
and teachers.
</p>

<p>
<i>b</i>) Principal Brooks stated that "the only part of the story that the newspapers
gave straight was the color of the young lady teacher."
</p>

<p>
<i>c</i>) Superintendent of Schools Mortensen stated that there was no basis whatever
for the story, and that no more trouble happened than often happened when mischievous
boys took advantage of the absence of the regular teacher.
</p>

<p>
<i>d</i>) Miss Stewart, the colored substitute teacher involved, stated that she was
assigned to the Altgeld School on Monday, to the Pullman School Tuesday, and
back to the Altgeld Wednesday. On Monday she had charge of the eighth grade.
About twenty-five minutes before recess five or six boys came to her stating that they
had been appointed as monitors for that day and asked to be excused. This request
was granted by Miss Stewart. Shortly afterward Miss Deneen, a white teacher,
brought the boys back into the room, stating that they had been disorderly; she
deprived them of their monitorship. One boy, Paul, mentioned in the article, resented
this and was impudent to Miss Deneen. He was suspended by Miss Deneen to
take effect the next day and to return only on condition that he made apologies for
his conduct. He was present in the room on the same afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Miss Stewart first knew about the supposed strike when she read it in the morning
paper. She stated that she had no trouble with any of the students during the entire
day, and there was no occasion to call in the principal, Mr. Brooks. Miss Deneen
also had some trouble with a girl in the same room. Miss Stewart had no trouble
either with Paul or the girl mentioned in the case. Mr. Brooks at no time during
that day was called into the room.
</p>

<p>
<i>e</i>) The parents of the children were incensed over the false publicity given them.
</p>

<p>
<i>f</i>) The suggestive effect of this report was immediate. At the Coleman School,
according to the principal, the children were greatly excited over the account and
looked upon it as a precedent which had not occurred to them. She thought that such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_523' name='Page_523' href='#Page_523'>523</a></span>
publicity, even if true, could have no good effect upon the minds and conduct of the
children.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The prominence given to the idea of "striking" also had its effect. Discussions
of strikes for other causes followed in the Pullman School. Later, in
February the students of the Crane Technical School threatened a strike
because of the removal of a teacher from the junior staff to the high-school staff.
</p>

<p>
On June 18, 1918, a Negro organization expressed the views of Negroes on
the <i>Chicago Tribune's</i> handling of a news article entitled: "Negro Benefit
Carries Mammy to Pearly Gates." The occasion of the article was a musical
recital given by Negro artists at the Auditorium and patronized by many
cultured whites and Negroes. It was a benefit performance in aid of the
families of Negro soldiers. The letter of protest to the editor of the <i>Tribune</i> read:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
On Saturday, June 15, there appeared in your paper what purported to be an
account of a meeting and concert at the Auditorium held for the benefit of Negro
soldiers' families. Despite the fact that it was distinctly a patriotic affair, presenting
on its program colored artists of unquestioned talent, and rendered in such a manner as
to evoke the warmest praise from an appreciative and music loving audience, your
reporter saw fit to tell of it by reciting what he knew or thought he knew about
Negro "mammies."
</p>

<p>
The body of the article contains sixty-two lines. Thirteen of these are devoted to
mention of the names of the colored artists, ten to a description of the crowd, which,
by the way, was inaccurate, fourteen to another list of notables in attendance and
twenty-five to an enraptured dissertation on "mammies." Not only is this reference
grossly irrelevant, but to colored people it is positively distasteful as everyone should
know by now.
</p>

<p>
The caption of the article "Negro Benefit Carries Mammy to Pearly Gates"
could by no stretch of fancy be taken as the heading for an account of a musical
concert.... There is no complaint against the limited appreciations of your
reporter, neither do we protest against his fondness for the adolescent idol of his
black mammy; but as a news item the account is ridiculously improper and out of
place.
</p>

<p>
The patriotic endeavors of the colored people of this city have more than once been
discouraged by just such thoughtlessness and incomprehension. You would do a
great service to colored people and to our government in the prosecution of the war
if in such accounts as appear you cause to be eliminated such personal reminiscences
and irritating irrelevancies as are calculated to make patriotism difficult and racial
relationship unsettled.

<h4>
1. GENERAL SURVEY OF CHICAGO NEWSPAPERS
</h4>

<p>
It was assumed by the Commission that so far as the ordinary reading
public is concerned the study of the three Chicago white daily papers with
the largest circulation and the three Negro weekly papers most widely read
would provide an adequate basis for a test of news handling, and for measuring
the effect on the public of accounts of racial happenings. The papers selected
are listed in Table XXX.

<p>
These figures do not represent all articles appearing on racial issues during
the two-year period. Many additional articles appeared in early editions and
not in the editions examined.
</p>

<p>
Generally these articles indicated hastily acquired and partial information,
giving high lights and picturing hysteria. Frequently they showed gross
exaggeration. The less sensational articles, permitting a glimpse of the stabler
side of Negro life, were less than seventy-five. The subjects receiving most
frequent and extended treatment in these three papers were: crime, housing,
politics, riots, and soldiers. In analyzing the articles themselves, under these
specific headings, it appears that the appeal to the interests of the public is
founded on definite assumptions in the public mind. It has come to be
recognized by both whites and Negroes, but more especially by the latter,
that crime is most often associated with the publication of Negro news in
white newspapers.
</p>

<p>
<i>Crime.</i>â€”The University Commission on Southern Race Problems in a
recommendation to the white college men of the South said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_525' name='Page_525' href='#Page_525'>525</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Colored people feel very keenly about the way crime committed, or alleged to have
been committed, by Negroes is played up in the newspapers. We never see the
Negro's good qualities mentioned. As a rule, when a Negro's name appears in the
newspapers he has done something to somebody, or somebody has done something to
him. It may be true that the newspaper's attitude toward the Negro does not
influence white public opinion as much as the Negro thinks, but it is bound to affect
the point of view of those white people who do not know the Negro.
</p>
</div>

<p>
As between North and South this press handling of racial matter seems
but a question of degree. For a public which depends upon newspapers for
its information an inordinately one-sided picture is presented. This emphasis
on individual crimes specifying Negroes in each offense tends to stamp the
entire Negro group as criminal. The following headings in white newspapers
will suggest the inference of the public as to whether or not Negroes are criminally
inclined:
</p>

</p>

<p>
The frequent mention of Negroes in connection with crime by the white
press has the following effects:
</p>

<p>
1. It plays upon the popular belief that Negroes are naturally criminal.
</p>

<p>
2. The constant recounting of crimes of Negroes, always naming the race
of the offender, effects an association of Negroes with criminality.
</p>

<p>
3. It frequently involves reference to sex matters which provides a powerful
stimulant to public interest.
</p>

<p>
4. It provides sensational and sometimes amusing material, and at the
same time fixes the crimes upon a group with supposed criminal traits.
</p>

<p>
The beliefs handed down through tradition concerning the weak moral
character of Negroes and their emotional nature are thus constantly and steadily
held before the public. Police officers, judges, and other public officials are
similarly affected, consciously or unconsciously, by these beliefs and by the
constant mention of Negroes in relation to crime. Arrest on suspicion, conviction
on scanty evidence, and severe punishments are the results. A vicious
circle is thus created.
</p>

<p>
Crimes involving only Negroes as offenders and victims receive little
newspaper attention. It might be supposed that they are uninteresting because
there is no element of race conflict. As long as crimes are committed within
the group, and this group is regarded as an isolated appendix of the community,
there is little public interest in them, and consequently little news value.
When, however, a member of the isolated group comes into conflict with the
community group, whether in industry, housing, or any relation, it assumes a
wider significance, and the information appears to become news of importance
in the judgment of the press.
</p>

<p>
Instances of purely Negro crime, which in the community at large would
have a strong appeal to public interest, take on news value only when the
ludicrous or grotesque can be pictured. For the most part, this type of article
is written by a reporter with some reputation for wit. He inserts the expected
Negro dialect, whether with or without warrant, and proceeds to make an
amusing story.
</p>

<p>
<i>Negro soldiers.</i>â€”News interest in articles on Negro soldiers appears to be
founded largely on sentiment. During the war Negro soldiers, especially from
Illinois, were given unstinted praise by the public and the newspapers. Illustrative
headlines follow:

<i>Housing.</i>â€”The subject of the housing of the Negro is interesting because
of its peculiar connection with: (<i>a</i>) segregation; (<i>b</i>) bombing; (<i>c</i>) neighborhood
antagonisms; (<i>d</i>) alleged depreciation of property; (<i>e</i>) Hyde Park-Kenwood
efforts to keep Negroes out of the district.
</p>

<p>
During 1917 the <i>Tribune</i> carried six articles on Negro housing. One was
the mention of the purchase of a $75,000 lot by Mme. C. J. Walker, a colored
woman living in New York. Two related to the efforts of white residents to
keep Negroes out of white residence districts; two were devoted to the effort
of white residents to put Negroes out of white districts; and one to a meeting
of realty men at which, it was alleged, angry Negroes "blasted harmony on a
housing plan." The plan in question was a segregated Negro district to which
Negroes objected. Trends of subjects treated in news items are given:

<i>The migration.</i>â€”The migration provided a subject of sufficient interest to
stimulate a number of articles. Hordes of illiterate and impecunious Negroes
were pouring into the city, according to some reports, at the rate of forty carloads
a day; they brought smallpox and low living standards, imperiled health,
and created a dangerous problem for the city. The combined estimates from
day to day in the press would give a number of arrivals in Chicago, equal to
or even more than the migration to the entire North. Thus the articles ran:

<i>Racial contacts.</i>â€”Aside from the riots and clashes the most intensively

with intermarriage, positions of authority for Negroes, intermingling of the
races in resorts, and love affairsâ€”in fact, the usual taboo themes and "forbidden"
interracial practices. Some of these subjects are thus indicated:

2. INTENSIVE STUDY OF CHICAGO NEWSPAPERS
</h4>

<p>
A careful study of the three selected white daily papers was made covering
1918, the year preceding the riot, to note relative space, prominence, importance,
and the type of articles on racial matters. During the year 534 articles
appeared on racial matters distributed among the three papers as follows:

<p>
Most of the published information concerning the Negro and issues involving
him magnifies his crimes and mistakes beyond all reasonable proportions.
The Chicago public is aware of the sentiment against morons created by the
newspaper practice of calling persons who attack women or girls moronsâ€”an
unscientific classification, of course, since all who attack women are not morons.
Negroes frequently say that if each crime committed by a "red-headed" man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_532' name='Page_532' href='#Page_532'>532</a></span>
were listed as a crime committed by a "red-headed" man, a sentiment
would soon be created sufficiently hostile to provoke prejudice against all red-headed
men.
</p>

<p>
In 1918 there were more than 90,000 Negroes in Chicago. Practically all
of the more serious crimes in this group, especially those involving whites and
Negroes, were given publicity. This simple notation of crimes may be a
part of the routine of journalism. It does not, however, explain the obvious
appeal to passion found in many of them or even the prominence given to
articles of a certain type. Crimes, riots, intermarriage, lynchings, and radicalism
were the subjects of articles which, in their repetition and accumulative
significance, presented a disproportionately unfavorable aspect of the Negro
population.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> published, in 1918, 145 articles which, because of their
emphasis on crimes, clashes, political corruption, and efforts to "invade white
neighborhoods" definitely placed Negroes in an unfavorable light. Of this
number, twenty-three appeared on the first page of the first section and
twenty on the first page of the second section. It also published eighty-four
articles dealing with Negro soldiers, sports, industry, and personalities, which,
aside from flippancy in treatment, did not place Negroes in an unfavorable
light. Of this number, two were on the first page of the first section and three
on the first page of the second section. The relative length of articles indicates
another possible effect on the public. The unfavorable 145 articles contained
487 inches of printed matter, while the less colorful items contained 223 inches.
</p>

<p>
Front-page space amounting to eleven inches was given to favorable
articles, and 158 inches to unfavorable. Of the articles concerning Negro
soldiers appearing on the first page, four of the eleven inches concerned a report
that two Negro soldiers had been killed following a dispute at Camp Merritt
between a white sergeant and a Negro trooper.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Herald-Examiner</i> published ninety-seven unfavorable and thirty
favorable articles. Of this number, thirty-one unfavorable and six favorable
appeared on the front page.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Chicago Daily News</i> devoted thirty-three articles to unfavorable publicity
and fifty-one to publicity of a favorable sort. Of these, eighteen unfavorable
and eighteen favorable appeared on the first page.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bombing publicity.</i>â€”The bombing of the homes of Negroes is an expression
of lawlessness which in an orderly community should not be tolerated. The
primary function of the newspaper is to report the facts. Upon this basis the
public may then pass its judgment. In the case of a bombing it might be
supposed that an orderly community would wish to know the persons involved,
the damage effected, the motive, the action of the police and the result of
efforts to capture the perpetrators of the act. Ordinarily this is done in most
cases of lawlessness and in bombings not involving racial issues.
</p>

<p>
Of the forty-five racial bombings which took place in Chicago between
July 1, 1917, and June 18, 1920, fourteen were not mentioned in any of the six
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_533' name='Page_533' href='#Page_533'>533</a></span>
large dailies of the city.<a name='FA_88' id='FA_88' href='#FN_88' class='fnanchor'>[88]</a> Of the remaining thirty-one, seven were reported in one
paper, ten in two papers, nine in three papers, while five appeared in four
papers. Not one of the forty-five cases appeared in more than four papers.
Although there might have been a total of 270 news reports of these
bombings only seventy-four actually appeared. Of the forty-five bombings
the <i>Tribune</i> and <i>Herald-Examiner</i> each reported twenty, the <i>Post</i> fourteen,
the <i>News</i> eleven, the <i>Journal</i> eight, and the <i>American</i> one. In all cases the
reports openly recognized that these bombings were not the result of individual
grievances but involved organized effort and activity on the part of groups
or communities in the practice of throwing racial bombs. It was generally
referred to as a "race bomb" or "race war bombs." Typical headings were:

<p>
In two instances a racial bombing was considered significant enough to
occupy more than nine inches of one column. This space was given by the
<i>Tribune</i> and the <i>Herald-Examiner</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_534' name='Page_534' href='#Page_534'>534</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Jesse Binga, a Negro banker, was bombed five times. The article in the
<i>Daily News</i> was five inches long. In the <i>Herald-Examiner</i>, April 20, 1919, there
appeared an article, "Curious Boy Drops Bomb as It Explodes." The article
covered eleven inches, of which eight inches were given to the story of a boy who
picked up a bomb in the street and dropped it as a lady signaled him to drop
it because it might be an explosive. At the end of this article were appended
three inches containing a narrative of a racial bombing at 4722 Indiana Avenue
where Wimes &amp; Lassiter, Negro real-estate dealers, had an office.
</p>

<p>
The fifth bombing directed against Mr. Binga is treated humorously in
spite of the serious damage done to his home.
</p>

<p>
The average length of racial bombing articles was about four and one-half
inches. The explanations of motive offered were stereotyped in character and
involved assumptions which it is not considered necessary here to analyze.
It was explained that the person bombed was a Negro or that he had moved
into a "distinctly white residential district," against which encroachment
bombing had been instituted as an intimidating or expulsive measure. It was
sometimes stated that the person was a real estate agent negotiating with
Negroes concerning property in "restricted" districts. This sort of explanation
was either stated in the headline or appended at the end in a brief sentence.
The reports in the papers apparently undertook merely to notify the public
that bombings had happened. The following are examples of press treatment
of race bombings:

<p>
A typical example of newspaper reports of the bombings of Negro homes
appeared in the <i>Herald-Examiner</i> of April 4, 1920:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Bomb Blasts in Front of Negro Flat Building</span>
</p>

<p>
A black powder bomb was exploded last night in front of the vestibule of a four-story
flat building 423 E. 48th Place, occupied by Negroes. The building is owned
by Robert B. Jackson, who lives on the second floor. He recently purchased it from
Louis Cohen. The apartment is in the neighborhood peopled mainly by whites, and
the police believe racial differences are responsible for the bomb. The explosion did
slight damages. No one was hurt.
</p>
</div>

<p>
One of the typical shorter reports also appeared in the same paper May 25,
1918:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">

<span class="smcap">Bomb Explodes before Home of Negro Families</span>
</p>

<p>
A bomb exploded in the front of 4529 Vincennes Avenue early this morning,
wrecked the front porch of the structure and broke windows for a block around.
The building is occupied by Negro families. White residents objected to the Negroes.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Similar language was used in all the articles.
</p>

<p>
Most of the articles carried a suggestion of a race war on the South Side.
Many of the reports helped to contribute to popular anticipation of future
trouble. For example, in the <i>Post</i> of January 6, 1920, page 1, column 3, a
bombing was reported thus: "A bomb early today damaged the residence at
4404 Grand Boulevard which was said to have been a Negro 'sniping-post'
during the race riot last summer."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_536' name='Page_536' href='#Page_536'>536</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The home at 4404 Grand Boulevard was owned and occupied by Mrs.
Byron Clarke, and was not a sniping-post during the riot. It had been bombed
four times, once while officers were guarding it. All papers used the expression,
"No one was hurt." Property destruction was usually dismissed with statements
like these: "All the glass was shattered"; "the front porch was demolished";
"about $â€”â€” damage was done"; or "the damages were slight."
The <i>Daily News</i> was exceptional in using the word "outrage" three times.
</p>

<p>
Two reports gave accounts of arrests, and all others in which police activity
was mentioned merely said, "The police are investigating." None of the
articles gave the results of any such investigation, other than that the police
generally attributed the "hurling of the bomb" to the occupants of a black
touring-car. The articles contained no condemnation of the bombings as
lawlessness or crime except in the case of a bombing at 3401 Indiana Avenue,
where a child was killed May 1, 1919. The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> spoke of this
death as an incident of that bombing.
</p>

<p>
One of the two arrests above referred to was that of a janitor who was not
able to explain sufficiently his presence in or about a building which had just
been bombed. He was taken into custody but was soon dismissed. The other
arrest was that of the nephew of a prominent business man living in the neighborhood
of the bombed property.
</p>

<p>
During the time from February, 1918, to February, 1919, prior to the Chicago
riot, there were eleven bombings in the city. If each paper had reported each
bombing there would have been sixty-six reports. Only seven reports actually
appeared. During the six weeks immediately preceding the Chicago race riot,
there were seven racial bombings. Of a possible forty-two reports, only four
appeared, or two bombings in two papers. Thus violent and criminal expressions
of hostility which might have been checked by arousing the public
conscience silently continued. The resentment of Negroes increased, and the
ignorance of the larger white public remained undisturbed. The articles were
apparently written without much investigation. Upon the fifth bombing of
Mr. Binga's home, the <i>American</i>, <i>Herald-Examiner</i>, and <i>Chicago Daily News</i>
quoted Mr. Binga as saying, "This is the limit; I am going." Mr. Binga
declares that he did not say this, that he did not even see a reporter, and that
he had not moved.
</p>

<p>
During the nine months following the riot, publicity on bombings increased
to several times the former amount. Beginning in March, 1920, the articles
again showed slackened interest. The <i>Tribune</i> and <i>Herald-Examiner</i>, usually
giving most frequent publicity to such matters, missed about every other one.
The <i>Post</i> had no reports, the <i>Journal</i> two, the <i>News</i> four, and the <i>American</i>
none. Seven bombings took place from March 1 to July 1.
</p>

<p>
The apparent indifference toward race bombings in the minds of editors,
officials, and the public was indicated by the relative prominence given to a
race bomb which threatened life and damaged property as compared with
an "odor bomb" dropped in a moving-picture theater.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_537' name='Page_537' href='#Page_537'>537</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On the first page of the <i>Tribune</i> of February 11, 1921, under the caption
"Crow Raid Opens Inquiry into Bombs," were seventeen inches of space
reporting cases of "odor bombs" and emphasizing the determination of the
state's attorney to make investigation. At the bottom of the adjoining column
were four inches devoted to a dynamite race bomb which damaged a three-story
apartment and involved menace to life. No reference was made to any
effort by the state's attorney or the police to investigate. Similar prominence
was given to the "odor bomb" in the <i>Herald-Examiner</i>.
</p>

<p>
An editorial in the <i>Tribune</i>, February 14, 1921, condemning bombing made
no reference to the fifty-six race bombings of recent record, but did refer to
other bombing aimed at white citizens. The editorial reads:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">The Business of Bombing</span>
</p>

<p>
Anthony D'Andrea, whose aldermanic campaign meeting Friday night was broken
up by a bomb which injured seventeen persons, speaks with some indignation on the
matter as indicating a bad moral slump in political methods. If it had been a union
labor bomb, apparently, it would have been of no great importance.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a union man myself," he explains. "I wouldn't care if they threw a bomb
at my house. That's all in the game."
</p>

<p>
On the latter point D'Andrea is right. It is "all in the game," but the game is
one which gets out of control of the players. It is because bomb throwing has come
to be accepted as "all in the game" of union labor warfare that it is now being extended
to political warfare. The man, the gang, or the organization which sanctions or adopts
bombing as a method of obtaining results in ordinary activities cannot expect to be
able to restrict the use of such methods to one line of business.
</p>

<p>
Originally the bomb was a political weapon, as in the hands of the Russian nihilists.
In late years it has grown popular with labor leaders of a certain class. Such bombings
as the recent one at the Tyson apartments, ascribed by the police to labor troubles,
and the repeated odor bomb outrages at movie theaters, are sufficient illustrations
of its use by labor. The post-office bombing in 1918 and the numerous so-called
race-bombs exploded on the South Side are illustrative of the widening use of bombs.
In such progress D'Andrea should not be surprised that the bomb is being adopted by
ward politicians. Properly applied, a good bomb can be expected to neutralize half
a dozen or so precinct captains. Bomb throwing is becoming a business.
</p>

<p>
Friday night's bombing is a perfectly logical development. As a result several
men may be cripples for life, if they do not die. It is time such logical developments
are stopped. Among the scores of bomb outrages of the last few years, so far as we
recall, there has not been a single case of punishment of the perpetrators. They are
justified in believing that they are safe. As long as they retain that belief they will
continue to extend the business of bombing. One thing will stop it. That is drastic
punishment. Any person who throws a bomb is a potential murderer. Life in prison
is none too severe a penalty. Good detectives can trap some of these men and good
prosecution can send them to prison. It should be done and done now.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>The Abyssinian affair.</i>â€”The "Abyssinian affair" referred to earlier in this
part of the report, was treated with remarkably good judgment by the press.
It is to be believed that further clashes were avoided by the effective way in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_538' name='Page_538' href='#Page_538'>538</a></span>
which the newspapers pointed out that the demonstration was the work of fanatics
rather than a race riot. Two days later, however, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>
published an article ascribing the Abyssinian murders to "racial reds." The
article ran:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">"Abyssinian" Murders Bare Racial "Reds"</span>
<br />
Leaders Lay Unrest to Du Bois Creed
</p>

<p>
Shocked by the fantastic violence of Sunday night, when a United States sailor
and a citizen were killed by pseudo-Abyssinian zealots, thoughtful colored leaders
began a determined effort yesterday to stamp out anti-white exploitation and to
bring about better understanding....
</p>

<p>
This type of exploitation, they say, is aimed at the more ignorant among the
colored masses. It carries the same appeal as the glittering promises of the I.W.W.
and the Communists to the illiterate and ignorant among the whites.
</p>

<p>
According to Negro leaders, this exploitation is based upon the theory of <i>social
equality</i>. Its motive can be seen, they say, in recent utterances and writings of Negro
intellectuals, in which a high pitch of "social equality" fervor is established as a panacea
for the ills of the race. This theory, translated and exaggerated into ambiguous
prophecies by the soap-box orator, is slowly being percolated through the masses of
a race as yet generally unprepared by education to understand it.
</p>

<p>
Chief among the writers whose works have been of this intellectual caliber is
Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois.... His latest volume, a "best seller" entitled <i>Darkwater</i>,
has been widely circulated. It is a volume of almost super-intellectual caliber, and
is bitter in tone.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Darkwater</i>, which is taken simply as a typical volume, are found the teachings,
colored leaders say, which have been seized upon by those who, under the shadow
of Dr. Du Bois' reputation among colored folk, would seek to incite and exploit.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The "colored leaders" quoted were F. L. Barnett, R. S. Abbott, and
A. H. Roberts. They did not impute any such danger to Mr. Du Bois'
books. Mr. Barnett, for example, mentioned the exploitation of the "Back
to Africa" movement by Jonas and Redding, while Mr. Abbott and Mr.
Roberts spoke of the lack of sympathy among Negroes for criminal types like
Jonas and Redding. The article then stated the "Du Bois Creed," saying:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The agitators have used considerable skill in exploiting the Negroes by use of
doctrines which they have taken from Dr. Du Bois, as expressed in <i>Darkwater</i>. Here
are some of them:
</p>

<p>
"The world market most widely and desperately sought today is the market where
labor is cheapest and most helpless and profit is most abundant. This labor is kept
cheap and helpless because the white world despises 'darkies.'"
</p>

<p>
This is given as the underlying premise for the late war.
</p>

<p>
"But what of the darker world that watches?" the author continues. "Most
men belong to this world. With Negro and Negroid, East Indian, Chinese, and Japanese
they form two-thirds of the population of the world. A belief in humanity is a
belief in colored men. If the uplift in mankind must be done by men, then the destinies
of the world will rest ultimately in the hands of darker nations."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_539' name='Page_539' href='#Page_539'>539</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The article quoted from <i>Darkwater</i> a chapter, which, by cutting the text, left a
suggestion of sex intimacy between a colored bank messenger and a white girl
very different from the intention of the author. The entire article was calculated,
through its suggestion and insinuation, to rouse racial antagonism.
It is doubtful whether the "Abyssinian" leaders, who were ignorant fanatics
little known within the Negro group, had read Du Bois' books. With all its
wildness and fatuousness the movement was directed away from America and
from whites. A photograph of Du Bois was published with the caption:
</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Karl Marx of Negroes</span><br />

Noted Colored Philosopher Whose Works Are Used by Agitators to<br />

</p>

<p>
<i>Miscegenation.</i>â€”Similarly dangerous treatment is apparent in an article
which appeared in the <i>Tribune</i> of November 6, 1920, under the heading:
"Miscegenation is O.K.'d in New Constitution."
</p>

<p>
The article called attention to a proposed provision in the new state
constitution of Illinois against public discrimination on account of color,
which was intended to put into the constitution rights already guaranteed by
state laws. According to the article this law was tentatively agreed upon
"during the newsy days surrounding the Republican National Convention and
escaped the notice of the public generally." The article said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Under the basic law, if adopted, a colored man and woman will be entitled to buy
vacant seats of a grand opera box, otherwise occupied by whites. A Mongolianâ€”if a
citizenâ€”and a mesochromic bride cannot be denied a vacant flat in the most "exclusive"
apartment building.
</p>

<p>
A law prohibiting the Japanese, as in California, from owning land, will be illegal.
Two colored people may take two of the four seats in the Blackstone restaurant beside
the wives of two packers.
</p>

<p>
A member of the convention said yesterday that it is as broad and comprehensive
as it can be made. He claimed that this sentence in the constitution will prevent the
Legislature from prohibiting in any way the colored citizen from getting all the rights
and privileges accorded to other citizens. According to this constitutional delegate
and lawyer the new constitution, as now worded, will prevent segregation of the
Negroes, Jim-Crow cars, or special schools for the colored.
</p>

<p>
A Negro lawyer said that the Morris section only recognizes openly the rights of
equality which were settled by the Civil War and enunciated in an amendment to the
federal Constitution.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The remainder of the article dealt in brief with fifteen other decisions of
the Convention. These decisions were merely stated and not commented
upon.
</p>

<p>
<i>Newspaper handling of the "back of the Yards" fire.</i>â€”At the close of the
Chicago riot fire was set to a large number of houses back of the Stock Yards.
Since these were the homes of white persons, principally Lithuanians, it was
generally assumed that it was an act of retaliation by Negroes. Articles in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_540' name='Page_540' href='#Page_540'>540</a></span>
the newspapers strengthened the belief. The <i>Chicago Daily News</i> article gave
a full account of statements made by Fire Marshal O'Connor to the effect that
Negroes were responsible. It stated that the police and militia were combing
the South Side for a band of eight Negroes, alleged automobile fire bugs.
These men, it was said, were stalled in an automobile at West Fifty-fifth and
South Wood streets ten blocks south of the fire; when the police reached Fifty-fifth
Street the Negroes had repaired their car and fled. John R. McCabe,
Fire Department attorney, was reported as being positive that the fire was
started by Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Investigation was made by the Commission to ascertain the facts concerning
Negro responsibility for these incendiary fires. The state's attorney declared
that no records had come to his office implicating Negroes, and that he had no
information, except rumors which he seriously questioned. The records, he
thought, were held at the Stock Yards police court. Inquiry at this police
station disclosed the fact that no Negroes had been apprehended on this charge,
and the belief was expressed that the act was committed by white men with
blackened faces. The fire marshal's office had no record other than unsubstantiated
rumors spread by persons living in the district. The matter had
been dropped for lack of evidence.
</p>

<p>
<i>Negro revolt.</i>â€”On January 4, 1920, during the general crusade against
"reds" the <i>Herald-Examiner</i> published a two-inch headline across the top
of the first page saying:
</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Reds Plot Negro Revolt</span><br />
I.W.W. Bomb Plant Found on South Side
</p>

<p>
The article mentioned below alleged secret activities of Negroes and their
plans to revolt against the government. The bomb plant and many of their
secret plans were reported to have been discovered by the state's attorney's
office. The article further stated: "In Chicago it was learned that the
headquarters for Negro revolutionary propaganda are centered in these four
organizations: The Free Thought Society, Universal Negro Improvement
Association, Negro Protective League, and Soldiers and Sailors Club."
</p>

<p>
Each organization named was, as a matter of fact, open to the public,
though patronized almost entirely by Negroes. The Negro Improvement
Association was by no means secret in its plans; it published a newspaper in
which they were set forth. The slogan of this organization was then and is
now, "Back to Africa," and not "Down with the United States."
</p>

<p>
The Free Thought Society mentioned is the Chicago Free Thought Educational
Society. The following is a declaration of its principles:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In order to achieve a better understanding of the phenomena of nature, for ourselves
and for such of our fellow-men as shall care to become affiliated with us, we do
hereby bind ourselves by the following declaration of principles.
</p>

<p>
First: That the attainment of truth shall be the fundamental purpose of the work
of this society and all its members.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_541' name='Page_541' href='#Page_541'>541</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Second: That truth shall be recognized as that body of conclusions which may be
logically drawn from the facts of nature as evidence by the five senses, or may be
demonstrated mathematically.
</p>

<p>
Third: That we abstain from all dogma, insisting upon a fair and impartial
investigation of all subjects and at all times.
</p>

<p>
Fourth: That we do recognize a universal kinship binding together in one common
band all members of the human society regardless of race, color or sex.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Among its members are W. E. Mollison, F. D. Summers, and among its
honorary members are F. Percy Ward, lecturer for the Chicago Rationalist
Society, and Clarence S. Darrow. The Negro Protective League is an employment
office and day nursery. The full name of the organization is the Negro
Equal Rights and Protective Association.
</p>

<p>
The Soldiers and Sailors Club is a community house located on the South
Side and a branch of the local War Camp Community Service. It served
during war time as a recreational and social center for returning soldiers, and
in 1920 became the South Side Branch of Community Service, Incorporated.
At the time of the article it was under the general supervision of the Chicago
Community Service, of which Eugene T. Lies, formerly of the United Charities,
was director.
</p>

<p>
<i>Newspaper handling of the Waukegan riot.</i>â€”Considerable excitement was
occasioned by reports in all the Chicago daily papers of a race riot in Waukegan,
about thirty-six miles north of Chicago. The first news reports gave the
following versions:

THE BEGINNING OF THE RIOT
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Tribune</i>, June 1, 1920:
</p>

<p>
A group of Negro boys in Sheridan Road stood about stoning passing automobiles
for several hours, finally shattering a windshield on the car of Lieut.
H. B. Blazier and injuring Mrs. Blazier.
</p>

<p>
<i>A throng of sailors and marines were passing when Mrs. Blazier was injured
and they immediately chased the Negro boys. The chase led to the Sherman House,
a rooming place for Negroes, and when the persons living there defended the boys and
sought to drive off the sailors, there was a prospect of serious trouble.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Daily News</i>, June 1, 1920:
</p>

<p>
According to the police a thirteen-year-old colored boy and his little sister
had been in ambush near Sheridan Road throwing stones at passing automobiles.
<i>One of the stones</i> struck the windshield of a car driven by a coal dealer, Chas.
Bairscow, according to Assistant Chief of Police Thomas Tyrrell, and injured a
woman occupant of the car. Another shattered the windshield of the car of
Lieut. A. F. Blasier a naval officer. Mrs. Blasier was cut by flying glass. When he
drove into the city Lieut. Blasier told several sailors of the affair and the news
quickly spread. The town was alive with marines and sailors on "shore leave."
They concentrated in the town square and upon a signal made an attack on the
Sherman House, a hostelry occupied by Negroes.

CLASHES
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Tribune</i>, June 1, 1920:
</p>

<p>
For hours there were individual instances of attacks by both whites and
Negroes in various parts of the town.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Daily News</i>, June 1, 1920:
</p>

<p>
A general man hunt ensued. One group stormed the postoffice and tried
to break open the doors, as it was thought a Negro was hiding there. Another made
an attack on the house of Ike Franklin, colored. Ike had fled. Another group
chased a Negro across the Genesee bridge in the center of the town. It had nearly
captured him when the blue-jacket guards arrived in trucks. Under command
of Provost Marshall Lieut. A. C. Fisher the town was quickly cleared. The police
arrested the following six marines: Thomas Levinger, Charles Thrawle, John Smith,
Burney Poston, Herman Blockhouse and Harold Denning.

RACE RIOTS AND THE POLICE
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Daily News</i>, June 1, 1920:
</p>

<p>
Acting Chief Tyrrell, after a cursory investigation, said that, as far as he
could learn, Policeman Frank Bence, on whose beat the trouble started, was not
in the vicinity at the outbreak. He said that if this proved true the man would
be dismissed. The policeman said he was making a tour of alleys at the time of
the stone throwing and knew nothing of it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Inquiry by the Commission brought out the following facts: The first
newspaper accounts of the riot indicated that Lieutenant Blazier and his
wife were driving in one automobile, and that Mr. Bairscow was driving in
another automobile. The story was that Mrs. Blazier was injured by glass
from the windshield broken by stones, and that a woman occupant of the
Bairscow car was similarly injured. Lieutenant Blazier and Mr. Bairscow
were driving in the same car, the windshield of which was broken, instead of
separate cars. There was no woman in the car and Lieutenant Blazier has
no wife.
</p>

<p>
The story was telephoned into the <i>Tribune</i> by a member of the staff of
the <i>Waukegan Sun</i>. This was the source of the report of the woman being
injured.
</p>

<p>
The stoning occurred one block away from the Sherman House, occupied
by Negroes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Negro housing in Chicago.</i>â€”The housing situation has frequently occasioned
alarm on the part of whites and bitterness of feeling toward Negroes. Many
newspaper articles, by their play upon racial fears, have increased the tension
between the two groups. An example of this type of article is given:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">White Tenants Fear Negroes Will Buy Block. Fire Chief's
Residence One of Those in Danger</span>
</p>

<p>
Twenty-six houses on the old Chicago university campus in East Thirty-fourth
Street, between Cottage Grove Avenue and Rhodes Avenue, are about to be sold to
colored people, according to the tenants....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_543' name='Page_543' href='#Page_543'>543</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to offer the houses to the present occupants at prices ranging from
$6,000 to $7,000 on easy terms," Mr. O'Brien said. "Of course if they don't accept
I'm going to do the best I can. I can't predict how things will turn out until the
tenants have given me their reply. They'll be around tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
"Among the residents of the block are Fire Chief Thomas O'Connor, Dr. William
E. Hall, and Dr. M. J. Moth.
</p>

<p>
"The tenants are all worried. Colored people have learned of this sale and for
days have been walking up and down and pointing out houses, discussing, apparently,
what they intended doing and where they planned to live. Unless every one of the
twenty-six buys his house it will not remain a white neighborhood. And I don't
believe we can get everyone to buy" [<i>Chicago Tribune</i>, February, 1920].
</p>
</div>

<p>
Inquiry by the Commission disclosed a situation similar to that underlying
many discussions of "exclusive areas." The article was written by a member
of the <i>Tribune</i> staff. It was learned at Mr. O'Brien's office that he had come
to that office inquiring about the matter. A member of the O'Brien firm
stated to him that he did not think the matter had any racial significance
because the firm intended to sell the houses to present tenants, all of whom
happened to be white.
</p>

<p>
<i>Labeling fights as "riots."</i>â€”Attention might be called to the suggestion in
articles which treat trivial disputes and street fights as race riots. On August
4, 1920, the <i>Evening Post</i> published an article headed: "Negroes Held to Grand
Jury after Riot in Street Car."
</p>

<p>
The article related a dispute over a car seat ending in a fight in which one
man was stabbed. The entire article is given:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Six Negroes were arraigned in the South Chicago court today, charged with
having started a "near" race riot in a Cottage Grove Avenue car last night. They
were: Isaac Nelson, 3256 South Park Avenue; Henry Broadnax, 3235 Calumet
Avenue; Samuel Bound, 3127 Cottage Grove Avenue; Albert McMurry, 3027 Cottage
Grove Avenue; Abe Mitchell, 3703 South La Salle Street and Walter McConnor,
538 West 45th Street.
</p>

<p>
McConnor, who was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, is said to have
taken a seat which Herbert Douglas, 1637 East 78th Street, offered to a woman
passenger.
</p>

<p>
In the scuffle which ensued, Douglas received a stab from a knife in the hands, it
is alleged, of McConnor, and was taken to the South Chicago hospital. The Negroes
were held on bonds of $400 to $3,500, pending jury trials.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In May, 1920, the <i>Tribune</i> gave eight inches to an article with the headline:
"Race Riot and Labor Riot in New England." The item reported a fight
between a Negro waiter and a Harvard student in one of the college dining-halls.
To show how trivial the incident was the article said in part:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The trouble began when Mayer (a colored waiter) made a slighting remark to
Wilson (a white student) and, grabbing him by the hair struck him in the face.
Wilson, in an attempt to defend himself, grabbed a water pitcher, and as he raised it,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_544' name='Page_544' href='#Page_544'>544</a></span>
Mayer drew a revolver and pointed it at Wilson. Immediately the student body was
in an uproar and rallied to the defense of Wilson.... The police are searching for
Mayer.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Daily News</i> referred to a "riot" precipitated by a colored chef's
remarks. The incident referred to loud talking in the kitchen of a Greek
restaurant and the chef's swearing at a cook which was overheard by a woman
in the dining-room. She objected, and the police were called. Another such
article appeared in the <i>Tribune</i> under the heading: "Women in Riot. White
versus Negro in Reformatory." The article told of state troops, local police,
and a chaplain having been mobilized to stop a "race riot." The casualties
given were one policeman bitten by a girl and several state troopers kicked
and scratched.
</p>

<p>
An instance of undiscriminating news handling appeared in the <i>Chicago
Tribune</i> of July 24, 1917. During the race riot in East St. Louis, while the
front pages of all the papers were filled with descriptions of the horrors, an
article appeared in the fourth column of the first page, along with the East
St. Louis riot news. It occupied fourteen inches and bore the heading:
"Whites Were Firing at Blacks near Scene of Murder. Four Negroes Jailed
after Slaying of Aged Man." Of the fourteen inches, six were given to an
account of the murder in Chicago of a saloon-keeper by a Negro in which
mobs of Negroes were said to have flourished guns; four inches were given to a
totally irrelevant report that two young white girls were chased through
Washington Park by a Negro; three inches more to a further account of the
first murder, and one inch to a report that a Negro was shot by a policeman.
</p>

<p>
On the second page was an eleven-inch article with the large headline:
"Lawyer Warns Negroes Here to Arm Themselves." Underneath was a five-inch
report concerning a Negro held for trial on a girl's story of an attack.
Nine inches were given in another article to a warning by Chicago labor leaders
that "the influx of blacks" to replace the strikers in the plants was bringing
a riot peril to Chicago. Under this article was an account of the freeing of a
policeman for killing a Negro; and beneath this an article from Orange, Texas,
with the headline: "Negro Shot Down Trying to Escape after Crime." Also
on the same page nine inches were devoted to a condemnation of black
politics in East St. Louis, and three inches to a minor clash in which a
Negro was reported to have drawn a knife when attacked by six white
youths. Two inches were given to the account of a clash between Negroes
and whites in New York City and seventy-two inches to accounts of the East
St. Louis riot.
</p>

<p>
The emphasis was on the work of the mob and the fact that Negroes were
replacing strikers in East St. Louis, and that this was responsible for the riot.
Some of the reports of Chicago incidents proved to be inaccurate. It developed
that Charles A. Maronde, a saloon-keeper, who was supposed to have been
killed by Negroes, his death precipitating a clash between Negroes and white
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_545' name='Page_545' href='#Page_545'>545</a></span>
persons, actually died of heart failure. There was no connection and no
apparent reason for inserting the incident of the white girls being chased
through the park by a Negro. This report was hearsay and was joined to the
article in this manner: "About the time the Negroes were being fired upon,
two young white girls were being chased by a Negro through Washington Park."
</p>

<p>
The item concerning the Negro held for trial on the charge of a white that
he had attacked her, turned out to be the imaginings of a young girl, which
involved a forty-three-year-old Negro, whose character had never before been
questioned, and who, as the facts developed, was entirely innocent. Linked
up in this article was an account of disciplining in the county jail; 150 prisoners
had been locked in their cells and placed on bread and water because they were
found shooting craps in the "bull pen."
</p>

<p>
<i>Flippant treatment and ridicule of Negroes.</i>â€”The "human-interest" newspaper
story is undoubtedly one of the most effective means of gaining public
attention. But it presents a single incident from which the reader is likely to
apply characteristics vividly set forth concerning an individual to the group
of which the individual is a member. It therefore leads to unfair judgments
of the group when the characteristics are not representative of the group, even
if they are representative of the individuals. It may be written with genuine
humor and with the best of intentions, or perhaps only with thoughtlessness
of the effect. But that does not obviate the sense of injury when the group
involved feels itself misrepresented and held up to ridicule.
</p>

<p>
Newspaper flippancy concerning Negroes has found a sensitive spot among
members of the race. Often there are suggestions and exaggerated descriptions
that can be characterized as nothing else than ridicule. Negroes especially
resent misrepresentation of Negro weddings, since no accounts are given
by white newspapers of more representative weddings.

<p>
During the war Negroes were as seriously engaged in battle and as freely
sacrificing their lives as other soldiers. When deeds of heroism were cabled
back to the United States, Negroes at home expected serious reports of the
activities of the sons, husbands, and brothers whom they had given up to fight
for their country. Exception was taken by them to newspaper treatment of a
serious feat as merely ludicrous. For example:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Black Yank Bags Hun; Major Wears Captain's Monocle</span>
</p>

<p>
Paris, Sept. 7 (Delayed). During the recent American advance out of ChÃ¢teau
Thierry, a Red Cross captain was looking about for suitable hospital sites, when he
met an American Negro soldier marching along toward ChÃ¢teau Thierry, following
close behind a German major. The Negro had transferred his pack from his own back
to the back of the German officer, and had also transferred the German major's
monocle to his own eye. Thus equipped the black warrior was parading triumphantly
down the road. As he passed the Red Cross captain he called out, "I say, look here
what dis Niggah done got" [<i>Chicago Evening Post</i>].
</p>
</div>

<p>
The following is a news report, with dialect, which was supposed to
have been cabled from Paris:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Negro Stevedore Coming Back "By Way of New Ohleens"</span>
</p>

<p>
August 17 (Delayed). George Washington Henry Clay Smith, Negro stevedore
at one of the American base ports, expressed the feeling of a large part of the expeditionary
force about ocean travel. "When dis heah wah is ovah," he said, "you-all
will nevah see me goin' back across dat ole ocean. Ahm not goin' back to United
States that away. Ahm goin' back by way of New Ohleens" [<i>Chicago Evening
Post</i>, September 9, 1918].
</p>
</div>

<p>
"Crap shooting" is ordinarily regarded as the peculiar pastime and passion
of Negroes. Popular expectation is fed by newspaper stories of these games,
made even more humorous by dialect, and the frequent implications of levity
in religious matters. Such stories would probably be enjoyed by Negroes if
they did not have the effect of picturing this trait as an exclusively Negro form
of gambling.

<p>
Or again, the newspaper plays up a supposed superstition of the Negro in
such an article as appeared in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> of January 1, 1920, under
the heading "Negroes Driven to Jail in Big Black Hearse." Pseudo-serious
newspaper reference was made to Negro street sweepers as the "official chamber
maids" of the city in an article in the <i>Chicago Herald</i> of March 31, 1916,
headed:
</p>

Newport News, Va., Oct. 27.â€”The attempt here today of a mob of Negroes to

enough to let him escape in the car. Cohen is held without bond [<i>Chicago Tribune</i>,

<h4>
3. NEWSPAPER POLICY REGARDING NEGRO NEWS
</h4>

<p>
The policy of a newspaper in handling racial news can be better determined
by studying its articles and editorials than by asking the editors. In fact,
when the editor of the <i>Tribune</i> was asked concerning this matter he referred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_548' name='Page_548' href='#Page_548'>548</a></span>
the Commission to the columns of his paper. It would be difficult to find a
definite policy on the race question stated and consistently followed out by
any newspaper in all items affecting race issues. Ordinarily when misleading
emphasis, misinterpretation, and distortions of fact occur, they are due to
the ignorance concerning Negroes which is fairly general among white persons,
rather than to any inclination to injure a disadvantaged group of people.
Reporters and editors frequently use, doubtless unwittingly, terms unnecessarily
irritating to Negroes. Individual notions of relations between whites
and Negroes determine the character, color, and emphasis of articles and
editorials.
</p>

<p>
A conference of editors of the white press was held to discuss these matters
with the Commission. The white press was represented by Edgar T. Cutter,
district superintendent of the Associated Press, W. A. Curley, managing editor
of the <i>Chicago American</i>, Victor F. Lawson, editor of the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>,
and Julian Mason, managing editor of the <i>Chicago Evening Post</i>. A brief
questionnaire was filled out and returned by Joseph M. Patterson, editor of the
<i>Chicago Tribune</i>.
</p>

<h5>
A. EDITORIAL POLICY
</h5>

<p>
<i>Chicago American.</i>â€”The <i>Chicago American</i> had recently adopted a policy
of eliminating the racial designation, "Negro" or "colored," unless some
special circumstance made the mention of race of particular news value. Said
Mr. Curley:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There was a meeting at which newspaper men were gathered together with some
representatives of the colored race down in a clubhouse on Grand Boulevard, the
Appomattox Club, and we were informed then that there was a feeling among the
Negroes that the newspapers emphasized in crime stories particularly the fact that a
man was a Negro. Our publisher and I discussed it, and we decided that there was
no more reason to emphasize that it was a Negro bandit than that it was an Irish or
Jew bandit.
</p>

<p>
Our general policy has been that we must treat the Negro with the same consideration
and tolerance as we give any other nationality. When he had those troubles
here before [the riot of July, 1919] we had some editorials to that effect.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Since the date of the meeting mentioned, the <i>American</i> has consistently
maintained this policy. Its editorials prior to that time had shown a spirit of
tolerance and fairness. During the riot especially it published editorials
designed to aid in the restoration of order.<a name='FA_89' id='FA_89' href='#FN_89' class='fnanchor'>[89]</a> It published perhaps the strongest
of local newspaper editorials condemning the bombing of Negro homes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Daily News.</i>â€”The <i>Chicago Daily News</i> in its reference to Negroes
used the expression "colored." Although it had sometimes published articles
which were not representative, it had often given space and prominence to
news concerning Negroes which presented them in a more favorable light.
This was clearly manifested during the world-war. Its interest in a serious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_549' name='Page_549' href='#Page_549'>549</a></span>
treatment of Negro affairs was shown in two special series of articles, the first
by Junius B. Wood, the second by Carl Sandburg, both published later as
booklets. These articles were well received and gave a necessary balance to
the more usual publication of stories involving Negroes only in crimes. In a
special column of the <i>Daily News</i>, "The Human Side of Things," many articles
have been published relating to efforts for social welfare among Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Concerning the use of the racial designation in reporting crimes, Mr.
Lawson explained that he considered it appropriate to mention race, as, for
example, in giving an account of a lynching or the bombing of a Negro home.
The racial designation, he believed, gave significance to the article. This consideration,
he believed, balanced references in other cases. He said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The newspaper point of view is to use the national, or professional, or racial distinction,
the word giving the distinction, wherever it interprets the news that is being
printed. There are some places where the character of the thing that is being told
naturally suggests the name Negro, or the word Presbyterian, or Jew or Gentile or
German or English, or Irish, and the newspaper never stops to suppress that. On the
contrary it puts it in as interpreting fully the character of the news that is being told.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Concerning news items unnecessarily provoking race antagonism, as, for
example, reports of speeches by a candidate for governor of Illinois on "White
Supremacy," he thought that most of the papers as well as his own "played
it down."
</p>

<p>
The statements of Mr. Lawson on other questions of policy are quoted:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Mr. Lawson</i>: We regard items describing constructive work by Negroes or items
indicating their advancement as better news than articles indicating degradation or
criminality on their part. The <i>Daily News</i> endeavors to appeal to all readers alike.
Instructions in news handling comprehend the employment of fairness, conservatism,
and candor; special instructions based on these principles are issued to cover special
cases. The terms "darky," "nigger," "coon," "shine," "wench," and "negress"
are not employed by members of the staff in writing news articles and are rarely admitted
to any class of matter. The style of the <i>Daily News</i> for many years has been
to speak of the Negro as a colored man and the Negroes as colored people. When
"Negro" is used it is rarely capitalized.
</p>

<p>
<i>Commissioner</i>: Is it objectionable?
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Lawson</i>: No, simply the style of the paper; typographic styles of paper vary.
Some papers capitalize more than others. Some papers always spell the word "Bible"
with a capital <i>B</i>. We don't. It simply follows the style of the paper. Dialects are
very seldom employed in the news stories. They are not used to ridicule any race
or nationality. The <i>Daily News</i> recognizes the importance and delicacy of the race
problems in Chicago in its news columns as elsewhere in the paper. It aims to assist
constructive movements, eliminate sensationalism, and quiet prejudice, while at the
same time presenting truthfully such facts as may be of interest and proper to the reading
public as a whole. I think, perhaps, I ought to emphasize that last thought to this
extent: the newspaper impulse is to print the news, that is the controlling, dominating
purpose of the newspaper mind, to print the news. But circumstances will at times
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_550' name='Page_550' href='#Page_550'>550</a></span>
suggest some particular expression of that impulse. Many times, as Mr. Curley
told you, we don't print the news, we suppress it in the public interest.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chairman</i>: But that is a difficult self-control.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Lawson</i>: Yes, I think so. To err is human, to print the news is the natural
impulse of newspaper people, but we do recognizeâ€”I know all newspapers recognizeâ€”a
very definite responsibility that, in so far as it lies within a reasonable discretion
and a reasonable ability to act, they must consider always the general public interest
in any grave matter. I think Mr. â€”â€” struck a very important interpretative status
when he said he didn't like to have the designation of the race in any respect used as
an expression of ridicule. Of course, that goes without saying. No newspaper that
is wise, let alone a newspaper that is fair, will deliberately inflict derision on any class
of its readers. It is a foolish thing to do aside from anything else, and anything that
would seem to suggest a deliberate intent to bring the Negro race into derision, every
man in the room would resent and properly. But I think, as I said before, that at
times a purpose of derision is imagined when there hasn't been any. I think that is
true and I don't think that it is surprising. If I were a member of a race that was
fighting its way all the time toward a square deal and a fair show, I presume I'd be
supersensitive about some things.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Herald-Examiner.</i>â€”The <i>Herald-Examiner's</i> principal handling of the race
issue has been through the presentation of news items. The term of designation
employed is "Negro." On several occasions the <i>Herald-Examiner</i> has
made commendable effort to show in its columns that a friendly spirit exists
between the two races. Most notable of these efforts was the picture of whites
and Negroes fraternizing in an effort to restore order immediately after the
"Abyssinian affair," in which two white persons were killed and several
Negroes, including a Negro policeman, were injured. Some of its editorials
on the Negro question were headed:
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, some of the most emphasized misrepresentations of
Negroes have appeared in the <i>Herald-Examiner</i>, as, for example, the story of
the "Negro revolt,"<a name='FA_90' id='FA_90' href='#FN_90' class='fnanchor'>[90]</a> and various riot articles.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_551' name='Page_551' href='#Page_551'>551</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago Tribune.</i>â€”The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> stated its policy of handling
Negro news to be one of "fair dealing and recognition of the difficulties." The
managing editor stated that the <i>Tribune</i> used dialect in cases of kindly human-interest
stories, refrained from the use of terms like "darky," "coon,"
"Negroes," etc., and employed the term Negro, capitalizing the <i>N</i>. The last
practice was begun at the instance of Negro leaders. During the threatened
race riot the <i>Tribune</i> sought the aid of leading Negro newspapers in Chicago.
There were no definite instructions regarding the handling of Negro news
matter. The difficulties in race relations recognized by the editors of the
<i>Tribune</i> are to be found in the following editorials:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">White and Black in Chicago</span>
</p>

<p>
It is possible for whites and Negroes to live in peace in Chicago. They have done
so for years, in normal conditions and in normal times. They have managed to live
without much prejudice. There has been good feeling. The Negro has had political
equality. There has been an attempt to give him a fair representation in public
affairs and not to resent his presence there.
</p>

<p>
We admit frankly that if political equality had meant the election of Negro
mayors, judges, and a majority of Negroes in the city council the whites would not
have tolerated it. We do not believe that the whites of Chicago would be any different
from the whites of the South in this respect....
</p>

<p>
We have been able to extend the essentials of citizenship to the Negroes freely
because the whites are dominant in numbers. All the essentials are in the possession
of the Negro. He is not Jim-Crowed by law. A line is drawn by usage. The law
in fact forbids what actually is done. It is a futile law because it encounters instinct.
</p>

<p>
Legally a Negro has right to service anywhere the public generally is served. He
does not get it. Wisely he does not ask for it. There has been an illegal, non-legal,
or extra-legal adjustment founded upon common sense which has worked in the past,
and it will work in the future.
</p>

<p>
The fact is that so long as this city is dominated by whites, whether because of
their numbers without force or by their force if they were in the minority, there will
be limitations placed upon the black people. They will be limitations which will
not work an injustice to the black people, who have a right to their own development.
</p>

<p>
There is no objection to economic equality. There is a decided objection to the
exploitation of black labor. During the war many Negroes were brought from the
South. Thousands of them went into the Stock Yards. The war shut off the supply
of common labor. The South supplied the want.
</p>

<p>
Thus the population of blacks doubled in war times. Concerns which brought the
Negro here to exploit him damaged the community by throwing a race question upon
it. Concerns which needed the Negro and put him upon an equal basis with the whites,
without importing cheap labor to take the jobs of whites, were legitimately supplying
their need for labor.
</p>

<p>
The race issue in California grew out of the fact that the Japanese were cutting
under the price of white labor. That will produce race troubles as quickly as anything.
</p>

<p>
Concerns may have been derelict in not considering the housing problem. The
imported Negroes could not live in the streets or vacant lots. They had to get under
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_552' name='Page_552' href='#Page_552'>552</a></span>
roofs, and in getting under roof they suddenly established new contact with white
neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
In this change there was bound to be trouble unless precautions were taken. In
the present case there is no evidence of precaution and some of provocation. It is
possible for that question to adjust itself. Such realty movements cannot take place
without friction, but the friction need not lead to riots. The city is steadily shifting
in residential character. Some of the people affected by the shifts do not like it, but
in normal times the readjustment is not disturbing to the community. A spread of
factories may change the character of a section. A spread of Negroes may do the
same thing.
</p>

<p>
A writer once summed up the Negro question by saying, "The North has the
principles and the South has the Negroes." We are coming to have the Negroes, and
we want to keep the principles so far as they are applicable.
</p>

<p>
Industrial radicalism, expressed in the I.W.W. propaganda among the Negroes,
will not help us to keep them. Thuggery will not help us to keep them. A rebellion
by the Negroes against facts which exist and will persist will not help us to keep them,
but we are confident that the situation in Chicago is susceptible of being handled in
the fashion it always has been handled.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Unsettling the Race Problem</span>
</p>

<p>
... Regardless of what may be considered the justice of the claims of the races,
the fact undeniably is that white and black will not mix in quantity. For this reasonâ€”the
reason reached by the juryâ€”the remedy seems obvious: there must be a plane
upon which the races can live socially distinct but industrially co-operative.
</p>

<p>
We are not disposed to think that the mass of the Negroes want social equality
in the full sense of the term. The <i>Tribune</i> has had many intelligently composed
letters from Negroes disclaiming any such desire. We believe the Negroes want an
opportunity to develop their own society. If this is true there ought not be widespread
objection to social segregation, directed by themselves and upon the theory of
wholesome living conditions.
</p>

<p>
But against what we think is an inherent disregard for exact social equality there
is appearing a very insidious propaganda among the Negroes. Whether it is being
circulated as a radical irritant calculated to disturb political conditions or merely is
the parlor philosophy of eager sociological transcendentalists, there is no means of
determining.
</p>

<p>
The propaganda urging agitation for social equality may have every support under
the law and under what ought to be human justice, but while fortified by what ought
to be, it flies in the face of what is....
</p>

<p>
The blacks form less than 10 per cent of the population of the United States. They
have less than one-tenth of a ghost of a show if the relations between white and black
become bitterly hostile. The average black man and the average white man get along
fairly well. Unless something happens to arouse their race prejudices and instincts
they live by tolerance which may not be a solution of race difficulties, but it is a method
of life and it is practical.
</p>

<p>
There is plenty of evidence just now that something is raising the race question.
There is evidence, it is said, to support the story that agents had played on the imagination
and ignorance of Negroes in Arkansas inciting them to arise against the whites
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_553' name='Page_553' href='#Page_553'>553</a></span>
and take their lands. Agitators have tried to excite the blacks. Some misguided
sentimentalists have tried to organize whites and blacks for the compulsory recognition
of social equalityâ€”a propaganda which is even more vicious than the red propaganda.
There are numerous elements and factors of disorder, and the consequences already
have been bad....
</p>

<p>
The position of the Negro is not a preferred one in American society. The Negro
is at an economic disadvantage. He is needed in the South and has been brought into
the North to meet labor emergencies, but he does not have an open field of work.
These disadvantages cannot be removed by discussing them. They exist in race
instincts and, along with the other disadvantages which the Negro meets, arise from
causes not at the control of the reasoning faculties.
</p>

<p>
No sensible person imagines that he knows what to do about the race problem
because he does not know a method of eradicating race instincts, and he would not
want to eradicate them if he knew how. A person may know what will surely happen
if the race instincts become inflamed and not have the slightest idea how to prevent
contact from flaming into violent action.
</p>

<p>
We know that if it comes to violence the blacks will get the worst of it. We know
that the situation as it exists now has many possibilities of danger. Both North and
South have had enough violence. Both may have more. Communities may not be
able to stop agitation or effectively to counteract it, but they can see that the processes
of law are applied with severity.
</p>

<p>
Law strong enough to make the races live in peace will allow them to find their
own ways of living in the same communities.
</p>

<h5>
B. HANDLING OF NEGRO NEWS
</h5>

<p>
<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i>â€”The <i>Post</i> is an afternoon paper. It does not carry
a large amount of news on racial matters. The policy of this paper was thus
expressed by the managing editor, Mr. Julian Mason:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have always checked information very carefully because we have had a very
close Negro sympathy for years and because we have had editorial writers who have
had special contacts. For instance, during the race riots we were constantly in communication
with a young Negro, Mr. Jackson, a Y.M.C.A. man, a fine man. We
checked up with him every single day. We used to call up Mr. Barnett and some of
the others.
</p>

<p>
We use the word "Negro" and the Negro dialect in what you call feature stories.
I don't know why we should deprive American life of that flavor. We also use the
word "darky" once in a while in a humorous sense, but not in news items.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>The Associated Press.</i>â€”Mr. Edgar T. Cutter, district manager, Western
District, the Associated Press, said in his testimony before the Commission:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Associated Press is a non-money-making, non-sectarian, non-political
organization. It is made up of over 1,260 daily papers. It is a mutual organization,
and it gets its news by an exchange among the members. Aside from that,
in big cities like Chicago we have our own bureaus which collect news in certain
events. In Chicago the Associated Press gets its news from the five daily papers that
are members, and from the city news bureau. This city news bureau, by the way, is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_554' name='Page_554' href='#Page_554'>554</a></span>
kept up by the Chicago papers and therefore is supervised by them and carries the
same class of news. Now on a big story such as the race riots, the Associated Press
got its news from all these sources, and it also sent a staff man who was experienced
in general newspaper work to the South to investigate for himself so we should get
the absolute facts. The Associated Press makes a practice of covering only news of
general interest, and it has made its reputation on the covering of facts. It never
handles editorials, nor does it ever make a comment on any news. If a piece of news
is not of general interest, at least throughout the state, it doesn't attempt to handle it.
It confines itself to news that is of general interest throughout the country, and
therefore it covers these matters very briefly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: Do you personally in your representative capacity handle any of the
news from the southern states?
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Cutter</i>: Only as it passes through here. Each district passes on its own news,
but we verify it if it ever appears to be incorrect. But any item that reflects upon any
person or upon any organization, even if we get it from our own newspapers, is first
checked up to its source, if that is at all possible, and then if there is a matter of controversy
and only one side has been stated, we always try to get a statement from the
other side, from some head official. In case of Negro news, we have many times had
as our representatives leading Negroes. Negro organizations have come into our
office and we have solicited news from them....
</p>

<p>
In cases of lynchings and such things from the South, the Associated Press often
has used twenty-five or fifty words and just let it pass with the mere fact. Where we
have covered crime in full, big cases, very often it has been upon the demand of the
members of the organizations.
</p>

<p>
News concerning Negroes is handled just the same as any news of any nationality.
We use the words, "Negro" and "colored." And it is always the desire of the
Associated Press and the attempt of the Associated Press not only not to injure any
person but to show the proper respect to all religions, races, and all classes of society.
It makes no difference whether we would capitalize the word "Negro" or not. Our
copy goes to the newspaper and, as Mr. Lawson says, they follow their own ideas in
that....
</p>

<p>
In all of our services we attempt to suppress news that we think might stir up
race relations involving Japanese, Mexicans, Negroes, or any others, and we follow
the lead of newspapers.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: What is the extent to which news from these members of the Associated
Press is verified when it comes from regions or localities where there may be prejudice?
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Cutter</i>: Wherever there is any question of the news or wherever there are two
sides, as in the labor question, we send a staff man out from headquarters who makes
his reputation and that of the Associated Press upon covering both sides of the story
equally. He knows very readily that if he doesn't cover that with thorough fairness,
he is going to hear from it later from one side or the other.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Chicago American.</i>â€”Mr. William H. Curley, managing editor of the
<i>Chicago American</i>, gave the following information:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Of course as to accuracy, we check that up the same as we do any item. We
find out where the item came from; if it is a police item we find out who is responsible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_555' name='Page_555' href='#Page_555'>555</a></span>
for it and send reporters immediately to cover it and rely upon them for accuracy
regarding the report.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: Let me ask whether you do that with the same care and precision that
you do in the case of a white man that is involved.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Curley</i>: Absolutely.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: That is no insinuation against the newspapers, but, for instance, it is
said that in the courts, if a man is a colored man he doesn't have the same thoughtful
care that a man has if he is a white man.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Curley</i>: A good many items, of course, come from the City Press that supplies
all the newspapers. If it is a matter that is trivial, of course a newspaper won't send
a special reporter but relies upon the City Press for accuracy. In a crime story we
eliminate the word "Negro" unless there is some reason for it. We don't use any of
the terms, "darky," "nigger," "coon," "shine," "wench," or "negress."
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: Do you get news unsolicited regarding Negroes any more than other
persons?
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Curley</i>: We don't take any news that comes in over the telephone without
checking it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: Regarding items coming from the South, is there any particular care
or checking used to see whether they are true stories, trustworthy or not?
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Curley</i>: You have to take that as it comes because that is your news service.
In other words, they are supposed to use their care down there the same as we do here.
We have to rely on that.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Chicago Daily News.</i>â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Mr. Lawson</i>: Sources of information are the same as in the case of other news,
and in addition matter originally in Negroes' own publications, bulletins of welfare
organizations, etc. Generally speaking, it may be said that more news on this subject
comes from outside sources such as telephone tips and correspondence than from
members of the staff. Perhaps 10 per cent comes from the Associated Press. This
is an arbitrary estimate. The same methods are used to determine the accuracy of
news concerning the Negroes that are used under other circumstances. The <i>Daily
News</i> does not publish any news except after determining its accuracy to the best of
its ability. No special reporter may be said to be assigned to news of Negroes, but
owing to his special study of the conditions in Chicago, however, Carl Sandburg is on
occasion called into consultation or assigned a topic for investigation. I may say
that years ago the Negro poet Dunbar was a reporter on the <i>News</i>.
</p>

<p>
Negro news is received from the Associated Press in the same manner as other
news. It is not often re-written, and then only when the subject-matter is local to
Chicago. Headlines are written to conform to the text of the article. The <i>Daily
News</i> is in touch with very reliable and well-informed Negroes in whom, because of
long experience, it has confidence. It obtains information from them and seeks their
viewpoint on serious matters. We regard items describing constructive work by the
Negroes or items indicating their advancement as better news than articles indicating
degradation or criminality on their part. The <i>Daily News</i> endeavors to appeal to
all readers alike.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_556' name='Page_556' href='#Page_556'>556</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Chicago Tribune.</i>â€”The following is taken from the replies in the questionnaire
returned by Mr. Joseph M. Patterson, editor of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The sources of Negro news are the same as sources of other news. Some comes
from the staff; some from the City News Bureau. Some of the local news concerning
Negroes comes from reporters. No news of any consequence is received by telephone
or correspondence. The Associated Press treats it on the same basis as other news.
To insure accuracy the usual methods of inquiry are employed. However, most of
this news comes from responsible news bureaus. Articles are re-written but only for
condensation. During the threatened race riot the aid of leading Negro newspapers
was sought to check information on serious matters. Each item is judged on its
merits.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
4. THE NEGRO PRESS
</h4>

<p>
Among the considerations which have been urged by Negroes as making
necessary the establishment of the Negro press are:
</p>

<p>
1. The indifference of white newspapers to the Negro group, their emphasis
on the unfortunately spectacular, and the consequent loss of items of interest
among Negroes throughout the country.
</p>

<p>
2. The importance of developing the morale of the Negro group, creating
a solidarity of interest and purpose for measures of defense, correcting the
impressions created by general opinion, and centering the attention of Negroes
upon themselves and their destiny. There has never been sufficient capital
for the adequate development of the Negro press. The purpose, however,
has been served of collecting items of interest from all sections of the country,
although they lack the facilities of so efficient an agency as the Associated
Press.
</p>

<p>
For a time practically all of the northern Negro newspapers fell under the
condemnation of the United States Attorney-General's office.<a name='FA_91' id='FA_91' href='#FN_91' class='fnanchor'>[91]</a> They were
accused of radicalism and incitation to violence. Frequent criticisms of the
Negro press declare it dangerous to the interests of cordial race relations.
Ex-President Taft in the <i>Philadelphia Ledger</i> said: "The editors of the colored
press should be reasoned with to cease publishing articles, however true, having
inciting effect."
</p>

<p>
Commenting on criticisms of this kind, Isaac Fisher, editor of the <i>Fisk
University News</i>, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Since the Washington and Chicago riots, the colored newspapers have been
bitterly arraigned in some quarters for being responsible for race hatred. But the
singular part of the indictment is that these papers are not accused of "falsifying"
the record, but of stating the grounds of the Negro's resentment; and there is growing
up a school of thought which argues that the colored papers should refrain from
publishing as news any facts, even though true, which serve to increase the bitterness
of the colored people against the white people. The comments made by those who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_557' name='Page_557' href='#Page_557'>557</a></span>
charge the Negro press with being the cause of race antagonism are unanimous in
interpreting as "incendiary" all statements of facts whose bare recital makes the Negro
discontented with present conditions.
</p>

<p>
It should also be noted that the charge of inciting to race hatred is laid against
the Negro press specifically for the period which has followed the end of the late war;
whereas the charge of inciting white people to wrath against the Negro is an old one
which has been repeated again and again during the past thirty years.
</p>

<p>
But, while the Negro press is not as old as the white press and cannot possibly
be charged with having "been on the job" quite so long, it is true, nevertheless, that
some of its members have cast all prudence to the winds since the signing of the
armistice, and have entered a mad race with the most "yellow" of yellow white
journals in vitriolic race attacks, in this case upon all white people, in the attempt to
meet the "yellow" white press more than half way.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the relative degree of culpability, "yellow" journalism is as reprehensible
when supported by a part of the Negro press as it is when upheld by a part
of the white press. The Negro might just as well learn now the lesson which the
white man must learn if he would save the civilization which he has been laboring so
long to perfect, i.e., that one's color and race do not excuse wrongdoing. If it is wrong
for a white newspaper to make white people hate colored people, how can it be right
for a Negro newspaper to make colored people hate white people?
</p>
</div>

<h5>
A. CLASSIFICATION OF ARTICLES
</h5>

<p>
The news items in Negro papers show a bias in reporting the opposite of
that of many white papers. They emphasize the Negro's view, frequently to
the point of distorting fact. If anything, they might be said to provide a
compensatory interpretation of the news. The three Negro newspapers
selected for study mentioned and briefly characterized in the foregoing pages
will show a classification of news items appearing during a forty-week period.
</p>

<p>
In addition to general news items concerning Negroes, the <i>Defender</i> gave
one page to sporting news, one page to theatrical news, two pages to personal
news items sent in by correspondents in other cities, and one page to local
personal items. On its editorial page two and one-half columns each week
were devoted to health articles by Dr. Wilberforce Williams.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Whip</i> gave one page to sports, one to theatrical news and organization
articles, one to out-of-town personal news items and one to local personal
items. Its editorial page devoted one column to "Legal Hints to Women,"
one-half column to "Health Hints," one column to "Legal Catechism," and
two columns to editorials from other papers.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Searchlight</i> gave one page to theatrical, local personal news, and church
notes. The editorial page contained two half-columns each week by "The
Man about Town."

<i>Crime publicity.</i>â€”Sensational news was featured in each of the papers,
especially cases in which whites and Negroes were involved. The intention

Definite differences of news value were noted, between articles appearing
in Negro papers and those in white papers on the same topics. The items,
for the most part, carried a specific appeal. Where the item was of general
interest and appeared in both white and Negro papers, the facts usually
corresponded.
</p>

<p>
The difference again lies in emphasis and prominence. Headlines for the
same news, as shown in white and Negro papers, follow:

<i>Group control.</i>â€”Although the Negro population does not rely upon the
Negro press for authentic general news it does rely upon it for news concerning
Negroes. The <i>Chicago Whip</i> devotes two columns of the paper to a section
called "Under the Lash of the Whip," the "You Know 'Em, Editor," and
"Nosey Knows." Persons who become offensive to the principles supported
by the <i>Whip</i> are put "Under the Lash." "Nosey Knows" and the "You
Know 'Em, Editor" attempt to hold individual conduct of Negroes to conventional
standards by the threat of semi-publicity, for example:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
You know those new "loop hounds." I know them because they go to the loop
for the purpose of visitingâ€”no object of buying anything. Well, tell them it's alright
to go to the loop, but they don't have to attract everybody's attention for blocks
around with their loud talk, using their ignorant, non-sensical expressions. And
should they get hungry while down there and feel like having lunch, don't stand outside
the door of a restaurant with a surprised look on their facesâ€”just tell them to
walk right in, in an orderly and sensible manner and order what they want. They
don't have to slip in like thieves.
</p>

<p>
You know the restaurants where those household insects known as flies are very
prevalent. I know you know them, because they are all along State Street, Thirty-first
and Thirty-fifth. Well, if you don't mind, kindly tell some of those proprietors
that there is a way of ridding their places of such nuisances.
</p>

<p>
You probably don't know that lady who resides in a prominent building in the
vicinity of Thirty-first Street and Indiana Avenue, and who tried to enveigle a young
girl on the street car to her flat by telling her that she could meet some high class
doctors and lawyers there. Well, you may not know her now, but if you watch the
columns of the <i>Whip</i> you will know her because she is gradually working her way to
the penitentiary by the route of the seduction law. Everybody will know her then.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Searchlight</i> carries a column by "The Man about Town" which is
similar in character. Two examples of its criticism of Negro conduct were:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The gang that hangs around the "pillars of knowledge" in the county building
every day at noon is becoming so obnoxious that they are attracting the attention of
everybody who enters the building.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_563' name='Page_563' href='#Page_563'>563</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Politicians from every section of the city crowd there and shoot off their "hot
air" in a loud tone of voice. They seem to think that the future of the country
depends on what they say or do.
</p>

<p>
They have become so bold in their actions they have begun to stop some of our
race women and engage them in conversation around that historic spot.
</p>

<p>
Now boys, cut out that "rough stuff" and take a walk around the block at noon
and let the fresh air blow on your beautiful carcass; if you don't the sheriff will ask
you to do so, or he may take some of you fellows to the North Side. Don't make
yourself a nuisance around the city hall and county building. Hear me, boys.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that is very disgusting is the arrogance of the girl waitresses in
some of these race restaurants. Instead of striving to please the patrons they act as
though they were doing you a personal favor to serve you, and when you are through
with your meal you must thank them for so doing and leave a piece of money at the
cash stand for them. If you don't do that the very next time you go into that restaurant
the waiter will not want to wait on you. The poor proprietor of the place, if he
or she is one of the "brothers" or "sisters," is almost helpless in the matter because
if he opens his mouth to one of these so-called waitresses about the mistreatment of
their guests he is minus a waiter. Go down in the loop and see how the other folks
attend to business and treat patrons. Awake, folks, from your slumber; you are fast
asleep. Do you hear me?

A fight on vice in the Second Ward was begun by the <i>Searchlight</i> and
finally given strong emphasis by the local daily papers.

<h5>
B. NEGRO NEWSPAPER POLICY
</h5>

<p>
Although Negroes for their general news depend upon the white press, with
its superior facilities, they look to the Negro press for full and specific news
covering the activities of Negroes. The editorial columns, as well as the
arrangement of news items and writing of headlines, are aimed at building up
the morale of the Negro group. Frequently an attempt is made to get these
papers into the hands of whites to acquaint them with the Negro's point of view.
</p>

<p>
A conference was held by the Commission with several Negro newspaper
men. The Negro press was represented by R. S. Abbott, editor and publisher
of the <i>Chicago Defender</i>; Nahum D. Brascher, editor-in-chief, and Claude
Barnett, director of the Associated Negro Press; Willis N. Huggins, editor of
the <i>Upreach Magazine</i>; and R. E. Parker, editor of the <i>Chicago Advocate</i>.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brascher, of the Associated Negro Press, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The colored newspapers have recently gotten up to the point where most of us
are proud to have them seen in the hands of our white friends and it is only through
them that they can really get our viewpoint. We cannot hope to have the daily
newspapers give our viewpoint and the aspirations and struggles that we are making,
and some of the things that we are suffering. I am very much interested in having
the editorial feeling of the newspaper get to the white people. Sometimes they may
be termed as radical. I found in recent months that some of the weekly papers published
in the South are saying things editorially that I would question about saying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_564' name='Page_564' href='#Page_564'>564</a></span>
even here in Chicago, and, as we say in common parlance, getting away with it.
I have in mind now one particular instance. In Houston, Texas, week before last,
the entire circulation list of the <i>Houston Informer</i> was stolen out of its office. The
theft was attributed to the new organization of the Ku Klux Klan. The daily papers
of Houston came out condemning that move, and also condemning the idea of the
Ku Klux Klan, and this young man has an editorial in last week's issue that is one of
the strongest I have ever seen on the matter, backed probably by some of the strong
things that have been said in the daily papers.
</p>

<p>
Now if we could have people of Chicago know just how the sentiment is changing
in the South in favor of a square deal and mutual toleration, we could soon get to a
point where there'd be no fear on either side of working out our salvation, you
might say, along co-operative lines.
</p>

<p>
Another instance concerned the <i>Plain Dealer</i> in Birmingham, Ala. The Ku Klux
Klan paraded the streets of that city about three weeks ago and in an editorial this
paper came out and stated that if that was done to frighten the colored people, they
had to do something different, because whenever they began to terrorize and came
down into the neighborhood where colored people lived somebody there would be
ready to meet them. That is a pretty strong statement for Birmingham, and they
got away with it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Chicago Defender</i> gives the greatest amount of space to criminal news
of a sensational type in the field of racial happenings. It is a great favorite
in the South with Negroes because it publishes news condemning the practices of
the South in terms forbidden to southern Negro journals. Of a circulation of
185,000, two-thirds of which is outside of Chicago, it was largely responsible
for stimulating the migration to the North.
</p>

<p>
The term "Negro" is used occasionally in the <i>Defender</i>. Its policy is to
use the term "race" man, where it is necessary to distinguish Negro from other
groups. Adopting the opposite policy from the white papers, it places "white"
after persons not Negroes to mark the distinction. Concerning this, Mr.
R. S. Abbott, editor of the <i>Defender</i>, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We use that as a bridge, as you might say, which we intend to blow up pretty
soon. We are leading the people away from the word "Negro," especially in our
papers. And in cases where white men are well known in the country we never even
put "white" after their names. We never put "colored" after a colored man's
name in this city.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Defender's</i> editorials are as a rule carefully written, balanced, and
critical, at times in contrast with the popular appeal of the news articles. The
<i>Whip's</i> editorials usually are on some aspect of the general race problem in
the United States. They are characterized by strong pronouncements of the
views of Negroes and violent criticism of practices alleged to be inimicable to
Negroes. An editorial from each of the papers will indicate the trends of
interests. The first is from the <i>Defender</i>:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_565' name='Page_565' href='#Page_565'>565</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Just between Ourselves</span>
</p>

<p>
Character is what we are; reputation is what other people think we are. We
get only the respect we demand; no more, no less. One of the greatest barriers to
our progress is the individual who attempts to curry the favor of the whites by whom
he is employed by openly humiliating and insulting others of his same flesh and
blood. Because sections of this country reek with color prejudice, must we lend a
helping hand to those who foster segregation, discrimination and "Jim Crowism"
in general? And yet that is just what many are doing.
</p>

<p>
In the railroad service as waiters and porters we have a monopoly, and those whose
runs require them to cross the Mason and Dixon line are often confronted with
situations that require good common sense in handling. In many states the law
requires the blacks and the whites to be separated on transportation lines, dining-rooms,
places of amusement, etc. There is no question as to whether these laws are
just or unjust. They are at least temporary laws and must be obeyed. But there
is something mentally wrong with the porter or the waiter who lends himself to such
measures, whether under orders from his superiors or not.
</p>

<p>
Admitting that to disobey such orders means the loss of a job, there are other
jobs that pay a better wage where a man does not have to sacrifice his principles to
hold. What other group of people in the world have those that could be induced at
any price to place their heel on the neck of even the humblest member of their race?
Are we less human, less interested in the welfare of our race than they? Are we still
puppets, still chattels, still ignorant of the fact that as we respect ourselves, so others
will respect us? This matter is put squarely up to you, Mr. Porter; to you, Mr.
Waiter. Will you play the part of a man and refuse to humiliate your people? Will
you cease playing the part of a spy? Will you singly and collectively tender your
resignation to employers who require you to "Jim Crow" one of your own? If you
will do these things there is only one thing that can happenâ€”a speedy repeal of the
offensive legislation.
</p>

<p>
Recently a young woman who was able to "pass" entered the Washington (D.C.)
railroad station cafÃ© and was given a seat at a table with several other ladies. Soon
there entered two refined, well-dressed, unmistakably colored, young women who took
seats at an unoccupied table. Immediately a colored waiter rushed over to them
and after a few minutes of whispered conversation the embarrassed patrons followed
the waiter to a far corner of the cafÃ©, where semi-screened off they were permitted to
dine. So enraged was the first young woman that she boldly went to the desk where
stood the white higher-ups and several waiters, and gave them a curtain lecture they
doubtless will not soon forget, not failing to tell them her own nationality. This
incident happened in Washington, the seat of our government, where the doctrine
of democracy is preached but not practiced.
</p>

<p>
Things worth having are worth fighting for. We must make sacrifices. If it is
the policy of certain business places to discriminate let us not be a party to the discrimination.
Let it be firmly fixed in the mind that we are a vital part of this nation's
life, that we are a necessary "evil," that our places cannot and will not be filled with
whites, no matter how drastic is our stand, providing we have right on our side, which
we undoubtedly have in this instance. This heart to heart talk applies to those
engaged in other lines of endeavor as well as it does to those who follow railroading.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_566' name='Page_566' href='#Page_566'>566</a></span>
Many who run barber shops, for instance, display the sign, "For whites only."
If we did not realize that these evils are the direct result of ignorance and lack of racial
pride, it would indeed be discouraging. But, truly, we are still a child race. We
must not be flattered by the tales of our marvelous advance during the last fifty years
into dropping our oars and resting on our laurels, for we have barely started up the
hill called success. When we have reached the first milestone on our journeyâ€”racial
solidarityâ€”the rest of the way will be comparatively easy. Success has come to the
Jew and to the Japanese because they are clannish. Black isn't a bad shade; let's
make it popular in complexions as well as in clothes.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is from the <i>Whip</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Who's Afraid?</span>
</p>

<p>
If the white races of the world are so sure of their inborn and inherent supremacy,
if they are so sure that they are the salt of the earth and the born rulers of human
kind, it appears to us as strange indeed that they should fear that their glory will be
usurped, their power depreciated, and their world-wide domination seriously challenged.
</p>

<p>
As a general rule, the giant does not fear the pigmy, neither does man, the acme of
civilization, fear that his civilization will be eclipsed by a new order of apes. Should
the tribes and clans of the highest developed gorillas seek to overrun the accomplishments
of humanity, no one would say, "Beware of monkey domination." Man,
according to his own concepts, is only a little lower than the angels and the monkey
just a little lower than himself. The white races claim that their darker brothers are
lower in the graduated scale of their own making than themselves, yet they cry out,
"Beware of the Yellow Peril and behold the Black Plague."
</p>

<p>
If the white races possess the keys to knowledge and the passwords to progress as
well as the elixirs of strength, why should they fear danger of "Black domination"
and "Yellow dictation"? The white man, even through the maze of his own conceit
and out of the trance of his self-hypnotism, sees that "he and his heirs" shall not
forever inherit the face of the earth.
</p>

<p>
The black and yellow races are breaking the white man's monopoly of organized
brain and wealth. The white man sees this and in his own bigotry knows that these
people are not his inferiors in latent abilities. He knows that the same fire of genius
burns in the breasts of the black and yellow races as did in the dark and mediaeval
ages. He knows that black and yellow men can unravel the mysteries of nature and
the intricacies of science. He knows that creative and constructive ability has been
beaten down by his might but yet it lives. The white races know that their present
achievements are small in comparison with those which will be accomplished. It is
feared that in the future, not in the mediate or immediate, but not far distant nevertheless,
that the sleeping giant will awaken, shake off the listlessness of a thousand years
and put into action again the powerful dynamo of his great reign and shake the
world again.
</p>

<p>
We do not object to the cry of "Beware of the Yellow Peril and behold the
Black Plague." It is the involuntary shriek of danger which is a part of man's reaction.
White people know that they are not superior to the dark races. They know
that the raillery about dark people being innately and inherently inferior is nothing
more than the outcropping of race prejudice, color hatred and ignoble fear. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_567' name='Page_567' href='#Page_567'>567</a></span>
fear that should they lose the power of might and brute force, and equal opportunities
are gained by the dark people, that they will be dethroned and surpassed. For this
reason they warn of the unfitness and undesirability of their darker brothers. They
ruthlessly declare that Japanese, East Indians and Negroes are not their equals and
justify all of their tyranny upon this foolish subterfuge.
</p>

<p>
We are tired of subterfuge and evasiveness. If the white man wishes to maintain
his power at the expense of the dark people of the world, let him cease his prattlings
about charity, human kindness and benevolence. Let him admit that he is afraid
of the rising tide of color and fear shakes his entire system. Let the world know that
the cry of inferiority and unfitness is not conscientious and that apprehension clouds
the brow of white humanity.

An editorial in the <i>Searchlight</i> read:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Cleaning Up the "Black Belt"</span>
</p>

<p>
"Death Corner" has a local reputation which bespeaks an abominable state of
affairs. Nice respectable persons dare not visit it unless heavily escorted. The
"East Side" in New York provokes a shiver by the very sound of the name. The
"Black Belt" carries the same dark background of hovering evil. One is expected
to regard black belts as isolated plague-spots full of lurking pitfalls for unsuspecting
innocents. It is spoken of as "that Black Belt down there." Little girls go there and
go wrong and you never hear of them again. When trouble is threatened in the city
the police force is dumped into it with clubs and pistols and rifles, patrol wagons,
flivvers and ambulances. For you can never tell what is likely to break out in a place
with so many mysterious corners and vicious characters. When the morals of the
city come under scrutiny the crusaders send up a howl of helplessness for the rampant
vices in that "Black Belt down there." The entire city believes it to be a bad place.
The neglect of it is a standing disgrace to the city, and yet the only means of cleaning
it up and bringing it up to the standard of the community as a whole discovered so
far is by keeping the handful of white persons out of it. The protests against the
mixed cafÃ©s, by far the loudest and most severe, seem to represent the sole spirit and
motive of the effort. No attention is paid to the iron circle tightening around this
section and making it practically impossible for Negroes to move out. No attention
is paid to the rundown schools in the district. No one is interested in providing recreation
facilities for the thousands of colored children growing up in the streets. No one
of these reformers and critics has suggested that a branch of the public library be made
convenient. The Juvenile Protective Association, an association whose purpose is
to prevent criminality, walks around the district and speaks about it as disparagingly
as the rest. The old Committee of Fifteen had no representative there to detect the
out-cropping of vicious places. It had been thus for the eight years of its existence.
And yet epithets are hurled at the district, and it is called bad names and the city
turns up its nose and goes on.
</p>

<h5>
C. NEGRO NEWS SOURCES
</h5>

<p>
Negro newspapers are published weekly because they cannot compete
with the daily papers in providing any part of the public with news from day
to day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_568' name='Page_568' href='#Page_568'>568</a></span>
</p>

<p>
For out-of-town news, the news letters of correspondents and accounts of
incidents by specially designated representatives make up a large portion of
the reports. All the papers have the service of a clipping bureau. Items in
local papers are noted and, when practicable, the newspapers telegraph to
some responsible person in town to send a full account of the incident. Traveling
men from Chicago and friends of the paper scattered throughout the
country also contribute to the news supply. News letters containing personal
items are still continued in the <i>Defender</i> and are said to be responsible for
the first extension of its circulation. The <i>Defender</i> and the <i>Whip</i> have
small staffs of reporters to cover local news. The objects of the Associated
Negro Press were thus outlined by Mr. Barnett, a representative of that
organization:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is an organization of affiliated newspapers. We serve eighty-nine newspapers
throughout the country, the total circulation of these papers as given to us for advertising
purposes running a little in excess of 400,000....
</p>

<p>
We handle items only that are of national importance because we are a national
news service. We gather all out of town items that we are able to gather for the same
reason, if they are of national importance. As a news service we would not take any
purely local item in Chicago unless it would interest readers in every section of the
country. We also get service from a clipping bureau.
</p>

<p>
It all relates to the interests of the colored people. If there is anything which
affects the country at large, which also has either an indirect or a direct influence
upon our group, we feature it, but as a rule most of the news which we gather is about
things which particularly affect colored people.
</p>
</div>

<h3>
II. RUMOR
</h3>

<p>
Rumors which significantly affect race relations consist largely of unfounded
tales, incorrectly deduced conclusions, or partial statements of fact with significant
content added by the narrator, all of which are given easy and irresponsible
circulation by a credulous public during the excitement of a clash.
Examples of this type of irritating untruth were found in the Chicago riot.
</p>

<p>
The number of Negroes killed during the riot (twenty-three Negroes and
fifteen whites) has been magnified in popular accounts beyond all reasonable
limits of credibility. It is popularly believed that more persons were killed
than official records indicate. The exaggeration has not been confined to
reports involving Negroes. For example, there was a report in circulation that
more than seventy-five white policemen were killed during the riot. The rumor
was traced to the half-jesting remark of a policeman that, as a member of a
benefit organization, he had paid death dues on a number of policemen greater
than the total deaths of the riot as popularly estimated at the time. This
number was placed at seventy-five. The director of the Civic Bureau of the
Seattle Chamber of Commerce, writing to a friend in Chicago, asked for authentic
information concerning the number of Negroes killed during the riot. He
sought the information because, he said, the industrial editor of the <i>Outlook</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_569' name='Page_569' href='#Page_569'>569</a></span>
had told him that police officers said that "more than 2,000 Negroes were
killed in the race riot," and that a certain labor report placed the number at
1,700. Suspecting that even the latter number was too large, although the
police mentioned 10,000 wounded and killed, he wrote for information.
</p>

<h4>
1. AN IMPRESSION STUDY
</h4>

<p>
A special impression study was made with a class of forty-nine students in
the University of Chicago, to measure the effect upon them of word-of-mouth
rumor, gossip, and newspaper stories concerning the 1919 riot. Specific questions
were asked concerning their understanding as to the number of whites
and Negroes killed and their source of information. The students ranged in
age from twenty to twenty-five years. Each was asked to indicate in the order
of their influence upon him the sources of information which gave him his
understanding of the magnitude of the riot. The following is a compilation
from their statements.
</p>

<p>
Ten were out of the city at the time and got their information chiefly
through newspapers published elsewhere. Their average opinion of the
number killed was fifty-five. Thirteen were informed chiefly by second-hand
stories quoting relatives who were in Chicago, policemen interviewed, and
others, and their general impression of the number killed averaged 209.
Thirty-three got their information from newspapers both in and out of the
city, and their average impression of the number killed was 115. Twenty-four
of those who were residing in Chicago got their information chiefly from newspapers
published in the city, and their average impression was that 131 were
killed.
</p>

<p>
A point of interest in comparison is that those who were out of town and
read out-of-town newspapers believed seventy-three were killed, while those
who got their information through local publications thought 131 were killed.
One young woman made this interesting comment:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I think a very conservative estimate of the number killed would be about 450 or
500. My first source of information, newspapers. My father also told me of the
affair and he is a medical director of an insurance company and therefore was in a more
or less good position to know.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A young man said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There were at least 200 people killed in the race riot. Sources of information:
a policeman who was stationed at Forty-seventh Street and Wentworth, my own direct
observations, and conversations with people who live in the Black Belt.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another young man said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
About 200 were killed. Chief source of information a review of Carl Sandburg's
pamphlet, and newspaper stories.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another young woman thought that about 150 were killed. She said that her
father maintained an office at Forty-third Street and St. Lawrence Avenue,
which is in the Negro district. Another said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_570' name='Page_570' href='#Page_570'>570</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
If I remember correctly, about forty black and white people were killed and several
hundred wounded, and there was a loss of several thousand dollars worth of property
by fire. The chief information that impressed me was personal experiences. I witnessed
one mob of 2,000 whites take a Negro on the West Side and burn him to death.
The newspaper gave me my information of atrocities on both sides.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another stated that he believed the number killed in the race riot in Chicago
was about 275, and continued:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I base my guess on reports of the newspapers, i.e., the dailies of the city and particularly
one weekly paper which in my opinion is entirely unbiased in such matters,
the <i>Weekly Socialist</i>. I personally saw four Negroes lynched and shot to death.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It might be expected that a fairly balanced type of impression would come
from university students. The effect of rumor stands out from the examination
of this highly selected group. In exaggeration the word-of-mouth rumors
led, followed by rumors circulated by newspapers and alleged first-hand
accounts of eyewitnesses.
</p>

<p>
Rumors from policemen and relatives placed the average number of persons
killed at 209, the largest average of the lot. This is significant when taken
with the reports given in the foregoing pages which emanated from policemen.
Undoubtedly their experiences were of such a nature as to make exaggeration
easy and plausible. They were living in conditions far from normal,
and their impressions were greatly magnified by the stress and the excitement
of events. The out-of-town students were less affected by word-of-mouth
rumor, and consequently their impressions showed the smallest average of
persons killed.
</p>

<p>
Personal experiences show more vividly than anything else the unreliability
of much of the testimony from observation that gives such frequent rise to
rumor. One student said he saw a mob of 2,000 whites take a Negro on the
West Side and burn him to death. Records show that only one Negro was
killed on the West Side (Joseph Lovings). He was shot and stabbed many
times, but not burned.<a name='FA_92' id='FA_92' href='#FN_92' class='fnanchor'>[92]</a> Another student "personally saw four Negroes
lynched and shot to death." No Negroes were lynched in the riot.
</p>

<h4>
2. THE BUBBLY CREEK RUMOR
</h4>

<p>
A persistent rumor during the riot served to provide an explanation of the
unaccounted deaths of the riot. It had plausibility and soon was accepted and
even repeated on the floor of Congress in Washington as a fact. Bubbly Creek
is a small branch of the Chicago River extending to the Stock Yards. Into
it flows a great deal of waste from the slaughter houses. The surface of the
water is thick with the scum of decomposed substances, hair, and trash.
Bodies could be thrown into it and remain undetected for a long time. A
rumor became current that bodies of riot victims were thrown into this stream.
It became so persistent that efforts were actually made to discover them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_571' name='Page_571' href='#Page_571'>571</a></span>
Even when no bodies were found, the rumor did not weaken. Examples of
how it cropped up in various ways are given:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A man told a friend of mine, I can furnish the name of that man; a man told
him that he saw fifty-six bodies taken out of Bubbly Creek. [A juror in the
coroner's inquest.]
</p>

<p>
I heard the story that 100 men had been taken out of Bubbly Creek. They used
a net and a seine to drag them out. [A. L. Williams, attorney, before the coroner's
jury.]
</p>

<p>
There is a story that was repeated on the floor of Congress that numerous colored
people were caught down there [at the Stock Yards] and thrown in Bubbly Creek,
and their bodies never recovered. A congressman from our district down there,
representing our Stock Yards district, told me that on the floor of Congress it was
recently stated that a man with a dumb-bell in his hand stood there at the big rock
entrance of Exchange Avenue and knocked a half-dozen of these colored men on the
heads as they passed through that rock door there. [A juror in the coroner's inquest.]
</p>

<p>
I hear they dragged two or three bodies out of Bubbly Creek. [A witness before
the coroner's jury.]
</p>
</div>

<p>
A meat curer in the superintendent's office of Swift &amp; Company said: "Well,
I hear they did drag two or three out of Bubbly Creekâ€”dead bodies, that is the
report that come in the yards, but personally I never got any positive evidence
that there was any people who was found there."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Chicago Daily News</i> of July 29, 1919, printed the subheading: "Four
Bodies in Bubbly Creek." The article did not give details, but said: "Bodies
of four colored men were taken today from Bubbly Creek in the Stock Yards
district, it is reported."
</p>

<p>
In its final report the coroner's jury made a conclusive statement regarding
the Bubbly Creek rumor which stamped it as pure rumor.<a name='FA_93' id='FA_93' href='#FN_93' class='fnanchor'>[93]</a>
</p>

<h4>
3. RIOT RUMORS
</h4>

<p>
The state of mind produced by rumors is manifest in other experiences of
riot. The following is an example:
</p>

<p>
At Forty-fourth Street and Grand Boulevard, a corner on which the only
Negro family in the block lived at the time of the riot, an elderly white man
clad in a worn dressing-gown, carpet slippers, and a skull cap, excitedly rushed
from his house to the curb and shouted to a crowd: "They're giving ammunition
away to the niggers at the Eighth Regiment Armory!" The crowd
became excited and finally threatened the house of the Negro family. A cry
went up, "Hang the niggers! The niggers in the house are firing at every white
man that passes!" The police searched the house and found an 1894 model
rifle, ammunition, that would not fit, and a decorated sword. The six Negroes
in the house were taken to the police station.
</p>

<p>
During the riot a white man was caught crawling beneath a house in
which Negroes lived. In his pocket was found a bottle of kerosene. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_572' name='Page_572' href='#Page_572'>572</a></span>
confessed that his mission was arson and justified his intended act by repeating
a rumor then current that Negroes had set fire to the houses of whites back
of the Yards.
</p>

<p>
One Negro said that a mob of white men knocked a colored woman down,
cut her up frightfully, and then took her baby and dashed its brains out on the
street-car tracks. He was of fair complexion and could easily be taken for
white. He said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I came upon the mob as they were laughing and shouting. Why I could have torn
every one of the white cusses in a thousand pieces. Just think, they stood there
laughing and shouting over what they had done. Why every drop of blood in
my body boiled and at that moment I swore to God in heaven that I'd kill some
white man if I swung for it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This report was not substantiated by wide and thorough inquiry by the
Commission.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rumor in the East St. Louis riot.</i>â€”Under "Myths," hereinafter discussed,
are given stereotyped sex stories circulated to produce antagonistic sentiment
toward Negroes. Many rumors, however, which had no relation to sex crimes
were circulated at the time of the East St. Louis riot. The following example
taken from the testimony before one of the boards of inquiry pictures the effective
use at East St. Louis of a rumor concerning an imaginary smallpox epidemic:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Mr. Tower</i>: Other statements I heard were that people feared an epidemic of
smallpox; that the County Hospital had been burdened for months with an average
of thirty cases of smallpox.... The whole County became fearful. You could
hear the same discussions away from East St. Louis. People were inflamed, and
their feelings were directed against the big employers of East St. Louis feeling that
they were responsible for the great influx of Negroes.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
4. RUMORS PREDICTING RIOTS
</h4>

<p>
Rumors that persist usually have some plausibility. The series which
follows contains elements of possible truth. Rumors predicting race riots in
Chicago centered about fixed dates on which excitement often existed each
year. Thus July 4, a holiday celebrated with fireworks and noise in which
shots would not be noticed, was the date set in popular expectation for the
Chicago riot that broke out almost three weeks later. Signs had been posted
in Washington Park to the effect that Negroes would be driven out of the park
on that date.
</p>

<p>
All this expectation undoubtedly caused preparation for trouble. It is
conceivable that this preparation at least accentuated the violence of the riot
which began on July 27.
</p>

<p>
Hallowe'en night, when ruffians could mask and take reprisals with less
fear of identification or detection than ordinarily, was the next date in popular
expectation. An official report to Washington by a governmental agency on
"Radicalism among Negroes," carried the rumor thus:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_573' name='Page_573' href='#Page_573'>573</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
... A report was received at this office to the effect that an uprising of Negroes
in Chicago has been planned for the night of October 31, 1919. This report came in a
somewhat vague form, through children attending schools located in the colored
districts. The Negroes were aroused over a report to the effect that the white
residents of a certain South Side district were planning to drive out all colored inhabitants.
The police were informed of the situation.
</p>
</div>

<p>
No riot occurred at or near that date.
</p>

<p>
May 1, 1920, was next rumored as the date when a riot would start
surpassing in violence any that had yet occurred. Labor parades were planned
in Chicago for May 1, 1920. It is also moving day, many residence leases then
expiring. Thousands of Negroes, it was widely said, would be told to leave
Hyde Park. Negroes, it was further said, had no intention of leaving and would
oppose ejection even with force. This rumor was taken up and circulated by
responsible authorities. As early as April 20, 1920, this article appeared in
the <i>Herald-Examiner</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">U.S. Sees Race Riots Here May 1</span>
</p>

<p>
Warning that race riots may occur in the South Side Negro districts May 1 was
sent yesterday to John H. Alcock, first deputy superintendent of police, by the
army intelligence department. The exact nature of the warning could not be learned
and no information could be obtained as to the supposed source of the predicted
trouble, but it is expected to arise when Negro families move into new homes in white
sections of the South Side.
</p>

<p>
Numerous bombings have given strength to the belief that more trouble may
develop this summer. Official notice to the police department is said to have been
made by E. J. Rowens of the army intelligence staff.
</p>

<p>
No comment on the warning could be obtained from Chief of Police John J.
Garrity or Superintendent Alcock. Capt. Michael Gallery of the Deering St. Station
said that he believed such reports were absurd.
</p>

<p>
"I have been all through the Negro section of my district today," said Capt.
Gallery. "All is serene and the Negroes are happy. I do not believe that there will
be any trouble this summer."
</p>

<p>
Capt. Thomas Caughlin of the Cottage Grove Ave. Station in whose district
the riots started last summer, said he was always prepared and on the lookout for
trouble in his territory.
</p>
</div>

<p>
An inquiry based upon this "May 1" rumor came to the Commission. The
manager of a West Side restaurant told the Commission that a Negro girl in
his employ had asked him whether it would be safe for her to come to work on
that day. Her sister had been warned in a friendly way by white fellow-waitresses
in a downtown restaurant that she should not risk coming to work
that day, "because there is going to be a race riot."
</p>

<p>
On May 1, as was to have been expected, thousands of persons were armed
and ready for the anticipated clash.
</p>

<p>
No riots occurred. The report was later denied by the Army Intelligence
Department.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_574' name='Page_574' href='#Page_574'>574</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Labor Day, 1920, was next set. Rumors flying fast were picked up by
agents from the state's attorney's office. Reports by these agents from day
to day show the persistence of the rumor. For example:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The U.S. Club which had planned to hold a meeting August 28, did not hold the
meeting because they expected another race riot on Labor Day.
</p>

<p>
On August 28, Negroes in the barber shop on â€”â€” State Street were carrying
guns. Many went to Gary and Hammond to stock up against Labor Day but found
that hardware dealers would not sell.
</p>

<p>
On August 29 little else was talked about in the Black Belt outside the coming
riot on Labor Day. The statement of Garrity [chief of police] that an extra cordon
of police would patrol the Black Belt was taken as confirmation of the rumor August 20.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>An averted clash.</i>â€”Seeley Street on the West Side is a district where Negroes
infrequently go. On the night of May 1, one of the dates scheduled in rumors
and reports for a race riot in Chicago, the daughter of a pressroom foreman was
returning home at night. As she passed an alley a man grabbed her by the
arm and attempted to drag her into the alley. She managed to struggle away
and ran home, reporting the incident incoherently to her father. Immediately
he armed himself and went out looking for the assailant.
</p>

<p>
Near the alley where the incident occurred, a lone Negro was standing
dressed in overalls. Across the street was a clubroom in which were a number
of white men. When he saw the Negro his first impulse was to shoot. The
Negro, however, gave no indication of being hunted, but reached into his
pocket, looked at his watch, and continued to stand there.
</p>

<p>
It occurred to the father that he had not learned from the girl whether it
was a white man or a Negro who had attempted to attack her. He went back
home and asked, and she said it was a white man.
</p>

<h4>
5. RUMORS CONCERNING NEGRO RADICALS
</h4>

<p>
During the country-wide excitement over radicals caused by the activities
of the Department of Justice in the fall of 1919, the Chicago office of the United
States Army Intelligence Bureau sent to Washington reports concerning Negro
organizations. These reports were founded upon scarcely anything more than
suspicion due to lack of information and acquaintance with the Negro group.
One section of a report made in October, 1919, read:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A convention of the colored organization known as the National Urban League
was held in Detroit on October 15, 1919, at which Eugene Kinkle Jones, Negro
agitator, presided. Mr. Jones has his headquarters at 127 East 23rd Street, New
York City. Wm. D. Haywood was invited to speak at this convention.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The National Urban League is an organization of responsible Negroes and
whites, with branches in thirty-one cities. It numbers among its executive
officers L. Hollingsworth Wood, A. S. Frizzell, Robert R. Moton, Mrs. Julius
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_575' name='Page_575' href='#Page_575'>575</a></span>
Rosenwald, George W. Seligman, and Mrs. Booker T. Washington. Its
avowed purposes are:
</p>

<p>
1. Try to show social welfare agencies the advantage of co-operation.
</p>

<p>
2. Secure and train social workers.
</p>

<p>
3. Protect women and children from unscrupulous persons.
</p>

<p>
4. Fit workers for work.
</p>

<p>
5. Help to secure playgrounds and other clean places of amusement.
</p>

<p>
6. Organize boys' and girls' clubs and neighborhood unions.
</p>

<p>
7. Help with probation oversight of delinquents.
</p>

<p>
8. Maintain a country home for convalescent women.
</p>

<p>
9. Investigate conditions of city life as a basis for practical work.
</p>

<p>
Concerning the reference to William D. Haywood and E. K. Jones, this
statement was received by the Commission from E. K. Jones:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The National Urban League did hold its annual convention in Detroit, October 15,
1919. William D. Haywood was not invited to speak at this convention. Judging
from the reference to Haywood the term "Negro agitator" as applied to myself
connotes a most violently radical strain in whatever methods I might be using to bring
about better conditions for the Negro.
</p>

<p>
Throughout my ten years' connection with the League, I have sought by courageous
but practical methods to bring to the Negro an opportunity in American life
and have urged Negroes to measure up in every way along lines of efficiency and be
satisfied with nothing but a square deal and equal opportunity in our national life.
</p>

<p>
I have never suggested violence of any kind as a means toward this end, nor, in
fact, has the idea ever arisen in my mind that this would be an effective means of
attaining this end.
</p>
</div>

<p>
From the same Intelligence Bureau report this statement is taken:
"Another recent report states that the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People with offices at 70 Fifth Avenue, New York City, is
planning to flood the colored districts with I.W.W. literature."
</p>

<p>
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is a
reputable organization of whites and Negroes numbering among its executive
officers Hon. Moorfield Storey, Rev. John Haynes Holmes, Arthur E. Spingarn,
Oswald Garrison Villard, Mary White Ovington, and Dr. Charles E. Bentley.
It has no relation with the I.W.W. and has never planned any distribution of
I.W.W. literature.

<h4>
6. RUMOR WITHIN THE NEGRO GROUP
</h4>

<p>
The <i>Chicago Advocate</i>, a Negro paper of an irresponsible, sensational type,
published under large headlines a report of a run on the Lincoln State Bank.
The reason alleged was indignation over the refusal of the white officials of the
bank to lend money on Negro property in Hyde Park. The bank officials
were accused of discrimination in favor of an organization of men in Hyde
Park who were making every effort to keep Negroes segregated within the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_576' name='Page_576' href='#Page_576'>576</a></span>
"Black Belt." The Pyramid Building and Loan Association was said to have
requested the loan. Since nearly 90 per cent of the depositors of the bank were
supposed to be Negroes, the act was considered an insulting disloyalty to
Negroes who supported the institution.
</p>

<p>
A number of Negroes, believing that their savings were in danger, rushed
to the bank. Soon there was an actual run, and for several days long lines of
depositors passed through the bank and carried away their savings. More
than $243,000 was withdrawn. The report proved to be without foundation,
and the three largest and most influential Negro newspapers aided in restoring
normal business relations. The president of the bank charged the head of
the Building and Loan Association and the editor of the newspaper that
published the story with responsibility for this rumor.
</p>

<h4>
7. RUMORS OF ATROCITIES
</h4>

<p>
Of the type of rumor which has had effect upon the sentiments of Negroes
concerning the Chicago riot, the following quotations from a pamphlet entitled
<i>The Chicago Race Riots</i>, by Austin D. N. Sutton, a Negro, provide a good
example:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In an investigation made personally by me, beginning about five o'clock Wednesday
afternoon, July 30, until far into the evening, visiting the districts from Forty-seventh
Street, East to Indiana Avenue, West to Wentworth Avenue, South to
Fifty-fifth Street, I found a little short street between Forty-eighth and Fifth Avenue
called Swan Street, that is not easily located, and very little known by the general
public. Eye-witnesses said that men, women and children were being attacked and
killed and thrown into the sewer, and no account of their whereabouts has ever been
given.
</p>

<p>
I found about twenty refugees who had been run away from their homes on
Forty-eighth, Forty-ninth and Fifth Avenue, also Wentworth and Princeton avenues.
Their homes had been burned, and they were made to flee for their lives. I have the
names and addresses of more than one hundred cases investigated, one more horrible
case, where a young colored boy was gasolined and burned after having been killed
and where colored women in the Stock Yards district were attacked and their breasts
cut off. These things were perpetrated by the whites upon peaceful law-abiding
blacks, some of whom had been residents for twenty-seven years in that neighborhood.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Thorough inquiries were made by the Commission into these alleged atrocities,
and no evidence was found to show that anyone was "gasolined and
burned" during the riot or that any colored women's breasts were cut off.
</p>

<h4>
8. RUMORS AND THE MIGRATION
</h4>

<p>
The rumors in circulation in the South at the beginning of the migration
of Negroes to the North were responsible for the presence in Chicago of many
who heard them. It is hard to conceive how the tale that the Germans were
on their way through Texas to take the southern states could have been
believed, yet it is reported that this extravagant rumor was taken seriously
in some quarters.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_577' name='Page_577' href='#Page_577'>577</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On the outskirts of Meridian, Mississippi, a band of gypsies was encamped.
The rumor gained circulation that the Indians were coming back to retake their
land, lost many years ago. Further it was declared that the United States
government was beginning a scheme to transport all the Negroes from the
South to break up the Black Belt. Passed from mouth to mouth unrestrainedly,
the tale became an established verity for many Negroes.
</p>

<p>
It was declared on the word of honor of "one in a position to know" that
the packing-houses in Chicago needed and would get 50,000 Negro workers
before the end of 1917. One explanation of the belief that the South was overrun
with labor agents is the fact that Negroes at the South saw in every
stranger a man from the North looking for laborers and their families. If he
denied it, they thought that he was concealing his identity from the police,
and if he said nothing, his silence was regarded as affirmation.
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of disappointments of prospective migrants were traced to the
rumor that a train would leave on a certain date, sometimes after the presence
of a stranger in town; they would come to the station prepared to leave, and
when no agent appeared, would purchase their own tickets to the North.
Wages and privileges in the North were greatly exaggerated. Some men, on
being questioned, supposed that it was possible for any common laborer to
earn $10 a day and that $50 a week was not unusual. The strength of this
belief was remarked by several social agencies in Chicago which attempted to
supply migrants with work. The actual wages paid, though much in excess
of what they had been receiving, were disappointing. Similarly in the matter
of privilege and "rights," it was later discovered by the migrants that
unbounded liberty was not to be found in the North. Many cases of grotesque
misconduct of newly arrived migrants in Chicago, against which more sober-minded
Negroes preached, possibly had root in exaggerated reports of "freedom
and privilege" in the North which had reached the South.<a name='FA_94' id='FA_94' href='#FN_94' class='fnanchor'>[94]</a>
</p>

<h3>
III. MYTHS
</h3>

<p>
There arise among groups of people various stories with little or no basis
in fact, which, through repetition and unvaried association with the same
persons or incidents, come to be regarded as true. These stories, when they
persist through years and even through generations, are myths. They are
usually the response to a prejudice or a desire.
</p>

<p>
In general they have some plausible and apparent justification. In turn
they lend stability not only to the beliefs out of which they were born, but to
themselves. Frequently they are the result of the assumption that because
two things happen at the same time they are connected by the relationship
of cause and effect. So long as these stories are uncorrected they hold and
exercise a marked degree of control over personal conduct.
</p>

<p>
Myths are important in any consideration of the instruments of opinion-making.
Fernand von Langenhove, a Belgian scientist associated with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_578' name='Page_578' href='#Page_578'>578</a></span>
Solvay Institute for Sociological Study at Brussels, has made probably the
first researches in this field. He took as his material the reports spread in
Germany by German soldiers concerning the Belgian priests. These myths,
for the most part unfounded, began to spread and eventually were taken up
by German authorities and given the stamp of official sanction. The reports
were investigated and found to be false and libelous by German authorities
themselves. The method by which these myths arose is thus described in his
book <i>The Growth of a Legend</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Hardly had the German armies entered Belgium when strange rumors began to
circulate. They spread from place to place. They were reproduced by the press and
they soon permeated the whole of Germany.... Public credulity accepted these
stories. The highest powers in the state welcomed them without hesitation and
indorsed them with their authority. Even the Emperor echoed them and, taking them
for a text, advanced in the famous telegram of September 8, 1914, addressed to the
President of the United States, the most terrible accusations against the Belgian
people and clergy.
</p>

<p>
  ... It was the German army which, as we have seen, constituted the chief
breeding ground for legendary stories. These were disseminated with great rapidity
among the troops; the liaison officers, the dispatch riders, the food convoys, the
victualling posts assured the diffusion of them....
</p>

<p>
Submitted to the test of the German military inquiry these stories are shown to
be without foundation. Received from the front and narrated by a soldier who professes
to have been an eye witness, they are nevertheless clothed in the public view
with special authority. Welcomed without control by the press, the stories recounted
in letters from the front appear, however, in the eyes of the readers of a paper clothed
with a new authorityâ€”that which attaches to printed matter. They lose in the
columns of a paper their individual and particular character.... The statements
thus obtain a substance and an objectivity of which they would otherwise be devoid.
Mixed with authentic news, they are accepted by the public without mistrust. Is not
their appearance in the paper a guaranty of accuracy?...
</p>

<p>
All these pseudo-historical publications are, however, only one aspect of the
abundant literary production of the Great War....
</p>

<p>
So one finds in this literature of the lower classes the principal legendary episodes
of which we have studied the origin and followed the development; accommodated to
a fiction, woven into a web of intrigue, they have undergone new transformations;
they have lost every indication of their source; they are transposed in the new circumstances
imagined for them; they have usually been dissociated from the circumstances
which individualize them and fix their time and place.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The evolution of myths concerning Negroes shows a striking resemblance
to these mentioned by von Langenhove. In this category would fall the myths
concerning Negro mentality, or the closing of the frontal sutures at the age of
fourteen; the "rape myth," or the belief that some character weakness and
inordinate sexual virility in Negroes make them rapists by nature; and the
"insurrection myth," or the recurrent assertion and belief that Negroes are
plotting the downfall of the government. These are general in their acceptance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_579' name='Page_579' href='#Page_579'>579</a></span>
They illustrate the tendency of authors observed by Langenhove in
his study "to incorporate new ideas with the complex old ones and show that
they are not surprising and that all earlier facts tend to prove it." The efforts
of some recent writers on the Negro question may be noted.
</p>

<p>
In 1895 R. M. Bache<a name='FA_95' id='FA_95' href='#FN_95' class='fnanchor'>[95]</a> made one of the first experimental studies of the
relative mentality of the white, Negro, and Indian races. His study was
based on only ten Negroes. He began with an assumption of the inferiority
of Negroes and was satisfied that he had proved it. In his tests the whites
were slowest in reacting to the visual, auditory, and electrical stimulation, the
Indians were quickest, and the Negroes about midway between. He deduced
from this that the whites were superior, the Indians next, and the Negroes the
lowest of the group. The Negroes he explained were slower than the Indians
because they were of mixed white and Negro blood and had inherited the effects
of slavery, while the Indians' mode of life compelled them to rely upon quick
movement. Therefore he said the Indian was of a higher race than the Negro.
Dr. Vogt, a German anthropologist, is responsible for the statement: "On
examining the brain of a Negro I find a remarkable resemblance between the
ape and the Negro, especially with reference to the development of the temporal
lobe." He made this deduction from the examination of the skull of one
Hottentot Negro woman.
</p>

<p>
A. T. Smith made association and memory tests and concluded<a name='FA_96' id='FA_96' href='#FN_96' class='fnanchor'>[96]</a> that the
Negro child was psychologically different from the white child in power of
abstraction, judgment, and analysis. He took a single Negro boy as typical.
</p>

<p>
For the purpose of studying myths pertinent to this inquiry instances were
taken from the testimony in race riots, both in East St. Louis and Chicago.
The excerpts which follow illustrate the tendency of myths to create and
give currency to rumors:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
NEGROES SECRETING ARMS
</p>

<p>
I returned in about an hour and learned from Col. Tripp that it had been reported
that Negroes were forming and had large quantities of arms and ammunition at a
saloon on the northeasterly corner of Nineteenth and Market Avenue; at the time
the small detachment of troops remaining at the City Hall was loaded into an auto
truck and Col. Tripp, Lieut. Col. Clayton, Chief of Police Ransom Payne and myself,
in my automobile proceeded to the saloon and pool-room located at the northeasterly
corner of Nineteenth Street and Market Avenue, where it was reported there were
large stores of ammunition and arms.
</p>

<p>
We accompanied Col. Tripp into the building and found perhaps fifteen or eighteen
Negro men; Col. Tripp ordered them to surrender arms and there being no ready
compliance with the order, he thereupon ordered them searched and found one man
who had a number of loaded shot-gun shells. [Testimony by Thomas L. Fekete, Jr.,
city attorney of East St. Louis, at East St. Louis Inquiry into Conduct of Militia.]
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_580' name='Page_580' href='#Page_580'>580</a></span>
</p>

<p class="center">
NEGROES PLANNING ATTACK
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: Now what happened Tuesday?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answer</i>: Well, Tuesday I spent most of my time in the City Hall except when we
would be sent out on false alarms, calls from the different parts of the city. That was
practically all of our work there then. There was no rioting on Tuesday, but they
continued calling from different parts of the city that Negroes were forming and ready
to attack, and we would send men, whenever they were available, out with squads,
two squads of men to investigate, but invariably it was a false alarm. [Testimony
by Major Wm. Klauser at East St. Louis Inquiry into Conduct of Militia.]
</p>

<p class="center">
CONCEALING ARMS FOR INSURRECTION
</p>

<p>
We then searched the building, particularly the dwelling quarters above these
rooms, for arms which it had been alleged Dr. L. N. Bundy had stored at this place.
We found that Dr. Bundy had sent two cartons of his property to this place for safe-keeping
and on opening the cartons, we discovered that they contained no firearms
or ammunition, but contained automobile supplies and some stationery. [Testimony
by Col. S. O. Tripp at East St. Louis Inquiry into Conduct of Militia.]
</p>

<p class="center">
NEGROES ARMING AND PLANNING AN ATTACK
</p>

<p>
Then we commenced to get reports from different parts of the city that Negroes
were arming, getting ready to attack. One of the persistent rumors was there were
two hundred Negroes armed around Sixty and Bond streets some place there. That
rumor was so persistent that Col. Tripp ordered me to take Company B down and
investigate it and the police sent one policeman along to show us the way and show us
the place where it was supposed to be. We got down there within probably three
blocks of the place and the policeman told us we better not get too close without forming
a line of skirmishers, which I did. I divided the company into two platoons. One
platoon under the Company commander and the other under the first lieutenant, and
we combed that district all through. The policeman deserted us as soon as we started
out and we were all left alone. We combed all over for an hour or probably more.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: Who was the commander of Company B?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answer</i>: Captain Eaton. We did not find a single thing except two Negroes
who just came out of a house. We searched them and they were armed and we
arrested them. We brought these back with us when we came perhaps an hour or
an hour and a half later.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question</i>: Is there anything else that night?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answer</i>: Yes, it was not very long until we got rumors that at about 27th and
28th and Tudor that the Negroes and whites were in a pitched battle. That is
about two miles I think southeast, and they asked me to go out and look into the
situation and take a squad of men with me ... we got to Eighteenth and Bond
and we were perhaps a quarter of a mile ahead of the truck and we were fired upon.
We stopped the car and Brown returned the fire. We could see smoke coming from
a vacant lot and by that time the truck came up and we formed a line of skirmishers
and went through and could not find a single thing.
</p>

<p>
The Chief of Police was advised, on rumor, that Negroes were forming in the
Black Belt for the purpose of marching on the whites. In response to this rumor,
the witness [Col. S. O. Tripp], the Acting Mayor [Fekete], and the military officials
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_581' name='Page_581' href='#Page_581'>581</a></span>
left for the seat of the purported mobilization of Negroes, but found that the report
was untrue. The record shows that during this temporary departure of authorities,
military and civil, acts of lawlessness were being exerted against Negroes in other
sections of the city. [Testimony by Major Wm. Klauser at East St. Louis Inquiry
into Conduct of Militia.]
</p>

<p>
ARMED AND MASSED ATTACKS BY NEGROES
</p>

<p>
... As we got to 27th and Tudor I found a first lieutenant of the Missouri
National Guard there. I afterwards found out his name was Crawley. He had one
soldier with him. He called him his orderly. I think his name was Murphy. There
they were perhaps a dozen young men, about eighteen or twenty, armed with rifles and
were lined up at 28th Street there under trees, that is behind trees, at least it looked
that way in the night, and perhaps a half a block more north it looked to me two
houses were burning; it was a big fire; they were burning, and they claimed that
the Negroes had been firing at them and they were returning the fire, and I guess
that is where the report came from. He advised me that it was a little dangerous
work up there and that we had better form a few men, form a line of skirmishers, and
I sent one bunch to the east side of the fire to see what we could find in there. So I
did that. I gave Capt. Easterday a bunch of men, one detachment, and Lieut. Brown
another, one on each side, and then Lieut. Crawley and one private went right through
the center of it, right next to the place seemed deserted and we could not find anybody
and we waited for the other detachments to come out and they did not find
anything and I walked around, it seemed on the west side of the block, between 27th
and 28th Streets, and I saw a couple of fellows sticking their heads up over the
fence, the fence of an old two story brick building, and I hollered. I thought perhaps
it was Lieut. Crawley and waited for him and we found a bunch of Negroes in
there, perhaps twenty-five of them. Lieut. Crawley and myself lined them up and
searched them and there was not a Negro who had any arms or ammunition, and
we asked if there were any more in the house, and they said this private came in and
already had three of us. So Lieut. Crawley said if I guard the ones outside he
would go inside and run the rest out, so in the neighborhood of one hundred fifty
or two hundred came out, men, women and children and we searched all of them but
did not find anything on them. [Testimony by Thomas L. Fekete, city attorney at

<h4>
1. THE RAPE MYTH
</h4>

<p>
It is the common belief among whites that Negroes are rapists by nature.
In this belief are involved the "fear obsession" of Negro men, held by many
white women, fear of the "social equality" bugaboo, condonings of lynchings,
and repressive social restriction as well as attempts at legislative restraints.
The persistency of these assertions and this belief point to an interesting
peculiarity of popular opinion.<a name='FA_97' id='FA_97' href='#FN_97' class='fnanchor'>[97]</a> There have been cases of rape involving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_582' name='Page_582' href='#Page_582'>582</a></span>
Negroes, but they have contributed no such preponderance as would justify
the wholesale charge against the Negro race. The tendency is to stress Negro
sex offenses as though they alone constituted almost the whole of revolting
crime. The usual proportion of white sex offenses is lost in the general statistics
of crime. In the South, where it was first persistently asserted that Negro
men have an abnormal tendency to sexual crimes, each crime, or attempted
crime, and in many cases even suspected crime, of this sort has registered itself
in a lynching.
</p>

<p>
In the twenty-year period between 1883 and 1903 there were lynched in the
South 1,985 Negroes. Rape was assigned as the cause in 675 cases. In 1,310
cases other causes were given. James Welden Johnson, field secretary of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, has prepared
figures on lynchings and sex offenses charged to Negroes which point
out the misrepresentation in easy but persistent charges and the unquestioning
acceptance of them by the public. He says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Whenever the Negro protests against lynching, nearly all southern newspapers
and a great many northern newspapers call upon him to deprecate the crime which
leads to lynching. The authentic statistics on lynching prove the falsehood on which
this propaganda is based. In the past thirty-five years fifty Negro women have been
lynched. In the twelve-month period, August, 1918-August, 1919 [when the statement
was prepared] five Negro women were lynched.

When the Congressional Committee on Immigration in 1911 made its study of
crime in the United States, an investigation was made of 2,262 cases in the New
York Court of General Sessions, and in that investigation it was found that the percentage
for the crime of rape was lower for Negroes than for either the foreign-born
whites or native whites.

Contrast these records, bad as they may appear, with the records for New York
County, which is only a part of New York City, and we find that in this one county
in the single year of 1917, 230 persons were indicted for rape. Of this number, 37
were indicted for rape in the first degree.

<p>
That is, in just a part of New York City the number of persons indicted for rape
in the first degree was nine more than the total number of Negroes lynched on the
charge of rape in the entire United States during the period 1914-1918. Among
these thirty-seven persons indicted by the New York County Grand Jury, there was
not a single Negro. The evidence required by the Grand Jury of New York County
to indict a person charged with rape must be more conclusive than the evidence
required by a mob to lynch a Negro accused of rape.

<p>
In Chicago the statistics of sex offenses tell a significant story. Chicago
judges in the criminal courts were questioned by the Commission on their
experience to test the foundation of this belief. Their replies were practically
unanimous. Some of them are given:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Judge Pam</i>: You talk about sex cases. Whether you call them rape cases or
crimes against children, I have more serious rape cases against white than I have
against colored people. The most serious case I had was about ten days ago, and I
sentenced the man to life imprisonment. I never had such a case involving a Negro.
</p>

<p>
<i>Commissioner</i>: We read a great deal in the papers about rape in the South. How
does the colored man stand on that matter in comparison to the white man?
</p>

<p>
<i>Judge Thompson</i>: Practically the same.
</p>

<p>
<i>Commissioner</i>: You spoke about crimes involving sex. What is your experience
with regard to whether they are committed more often by colored persons than whites?
</p>

<p>
<i>Judge Trude</i>: I don't think in Chicago they are committed more by Negroes than
whites.
</p>

<p>
<i>Judge Thompson</i>: In my work with the criminal court I was astounded at the large
number of crimes involving the sexual abuse of children, but I remember no case in
which a colored defendant was charged with that crime. Almost all other races were
represented, but I don't remember one colored man charged with the abuse of a
child.... I tried many of those cases, but never tried a colored man for that
offense. I would say the majority of them were slavic or German; practically no
Scandinavian.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dr. Adler, State Criminologist</i>: We had the same thing here in Chicago of a colored
man sent to the penitentiary on a charge of attempted rape or something of that
sort, where the identification was made by a child of six or eight years who picked
him out in a crowd under suspicion. No such evidence ought to be accepted. We
are perfectly sure, and everybody else agrees that such evidence is not sufficient to
warrant the action.

<h4>
2. THE SEX MYTH
</h4>

<p>
<i>East St. Louis riot.</i>â€”The records of the Congressional Investigating Committee
contain much evidence of the use of this myth in fomenting riots.
Edward F. Mason, representing the interests of labor, gave a vivid account of
the report that Negro men had committed vicious acts of assault against white
girls in the East St. Louis streets. He stated further that 200 white women
were among the 1,200 persons present at the meeting on the night of May
28, just prior to the riot, and that "we brought these girls along to see if we
couldn't teachâ€”we wanted to wake him [the mayor] up. He was in a trance.
He couldn't see the thing like we did."
</p>

<p>
Alois Towers emphasized in his testimony the sentiment among the whites
of East St. Louis just prior to the outbreak:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Mr. Chairman, yesterday I made the statement that the great influx of Negroes
was responsible for the riot. I want to try and show some of the feelings that developed
after this great influx of Negroes. It was a terrible feeling in the air. Everyone
felt that something terrible was going to happen. On the street comers, wherever
you went, you heard expressions against the Negro. You heard that the Negro was
driving the white man out of the localityâ€”by moving into the white neighborhoodâ€”that
the whites were being forced out of their localities. Stories were afloat on the
streets and on the street cars of the worst kind that would inflame the feelings. For
instance, I heard one story so persistently that I commenced to think later on there
might be some truth in it. First I thought it was just originated by some who might
want to inflame the feelings of the people. I heard stories of this kind and I heard it
no less than a dozen times on the streets of East St. Louis, that Negroes had made
the boast that they were invited to East St. Louis; that great numbers of white
people were taken away for war purposes; and that <i>there would be lots of white women
for the Negroes in East St. Louis</i>.... The whole country became fearful. You
could hear the same discussions away from East St. Louis. People were inflamed
and their feelings were directed against big employers of East St. Louis, feeling that
they were responsible for the great influx of Negroes.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Of actual assaults against white women there was found no evidence.
Testimony by the mayor before the Military Committee investigating the
conduct of soldiers adds substantiation to this fact:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Q.</i>: Now did you hear of any other complaints of these colored men from any
source as to their conduct and behavior when they first came here other than being
imported here to work in large numbers?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: Yes sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Q.</i>: What do you know about it?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: Some complaints that they were sticking up people, holding up people at
night time, and various other police violations.
</p>

<p>
<i>Q.</i>: Now were these complaints verified by the records, or otherwise?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: I think they were, they were arrested and locked up, got trial and punishment,
the usual procedure of the Police Department and Courts.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_585' name='Page_585' href='#Page_585'>585</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Q.</i>: You keep in pretty close touch with these Police Court Proceedings?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: Yes sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Q.</i>: So you would say that there were more colored people arrested and convicted
for such offenses as you mentioned than there were four or two years ago?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: I have not made that comparison, but I would think so.
</p>

<p>
<i>Q.</i>: Any other offenses except larceny and robbery?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: No.
</p>

<p>
<i>Q.</i>: Any sex outrages?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: No.
</p>

<p>
<i>Q.</i>: No complaints or prosecutions that white women were outraged by colored
men?
</p>

<p>
<i>A.</i>: No sir.

<p>
<i>Washington riot.</i>â€”The Washington race riot was precipitated by reports of
alleged attacks upon white women by Negroes. These reports were featured
in the daily newspapers with large front-page headlines, and suggestions were
made that probable lynchings would follow the capture of the Negroes. The
series of reported assaults totaled seven. In each it was claimed that a Negro
had assaulted a white woman. When the fury and excitement of the riot had
subsided and the facts were sifted, it was found that of the seven assaults
reported, four were assaults upon colored women. Three of the alleged criminals
arrested and held for assault were white men, and at least two of the white men
were prosecuted for assaults upon colored women. It further developed that
three of the assaults were supposed to have been committed by a suspect who
at the time of the riots was under arrest.
</p>

<p>
<i>Waukegan riot.</i>â€”A story with the implication that a sex issue was involved
was the significant feature of the riot between marines from the Great Lakes
Naval Training Station, aided by citizens of Waukegan, and the Negro residents
of Waukegan. It is entirely likely that the outburst was wholly precipitated
by the entirely false report that "Mrs. Blazier, the wife of Lieutenant
Blazier," was "attacked" by Negro boys.<a name='FA_100' id='FA_100' href='#FN_100' class='fnanchor'>[100]</a> Lieutenant Blazier, it developed,
was unmarried and had no woman occupant in the car.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chicago riot.</i>â€”The most atrocious murder of the Chicago riot of 1919 was
precipitated by a report involving an Italian girl. The story circulated that
she had been killed by a Negro. Joseph Lovings, an innocent Negro, chanced
into the neighborhood on a bicycle. He was set upon and murdered. The
coroner found fourteen bullet wounds, many stab wounds, contusion of the head,
and fractures of the skull bones and of the limbs. The report proved a myth,
for no girl was killed by anyone during the riot. The Negro killed was innocent
of any injury, and if a girl was injured it had not been learned by whom the
injury was inflicted. There had been no previous rioting on the West Side,
where the murder was committed, and no further clashes followed it. The
usual report of the burning of the Negro which followed an assault was also
circulated, and this was false and unfounded.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_586' name='Page_586' href='#Page_586'>586</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In the frenzy of the rioting in Chicago a report gained circulation that white
women were being attacked by Negroes. Some reports picked up by newspapers
asserted that women were being shot as the riot grew. The <i>Chicago
American</i> during the riot pertinently made a plea for cool-headedness and
intelligence in receiving reports. In an editorial it thus importuned the
citizenry:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Don't circulate wild stories that tend to infuriate respectable citizens, both white
and black. They are trying to suppress the hoodlums who have been responsible for
all the rioting.
</p>

<p>
Don't believe every infuriating report you hear, and don't repeat them to others
more credulous than yourself.
</p>

<p>
Depend on the <i>American</i> to tell you what happened just as accurately as careful,
intelligent reporting will permit.
</p>

<p>
The most notable instance of inflammatory faking was observed in one newspaper
(not the <i>American</i>) yesterday afternoon. It ran across its front page in big type the
heading: "Women Shot as Riots Grow." It was based on an incoherent, unsubstantiated
rumor which later investigation proved has no foundation.
</p>

<p>
The same information was received by the <i>Evening American</i> from the detective
bureau, where the report was received. The <i>American</i> published a few lines announcing
that the police had received such reports. Men were rushed out, but the
report could not be verified, and this newspaper withdrew further publication of the
unverified report.
</p>
</div>

<p>
At Chicago Heights a race riot was reported on August 7, 1920. It was
said in the press that a Negro motor-cyclist had run down a Hungarian boy.
The actual report circulated was that a Negro had struck an Italian girl. The
latter report was not true; the first one, contrary to press reports, did not start
a riot. In fact, there was no riot.
</p>

<p>
In the racial clash of September 20, 1920, the sex myth again arose.<a name='FA_101' id='FA_101' href='#FN_101' class='fnanchor'>[101]</a>
Immediately after one of the Negroes had struck Barrett down, the trio ran.
Few persons actually knew what had occurred. Excitement waxed high when
the wild report flew about that a Negro had attacked a white woman. A mob
of several thousand men, women, and children formed to storm the church in
which they had sought refuge.
</p>

<p>
An investigator from the Commission, sent out immediately after the
clash, picked up traces of this myth in the sentiments of white residents of
the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
There was a story which everyone in the neighborhood seemed to know
concerning trouble on the street-car lines between Negroes and whites. A
middle-aged Irish woman on Union Avenue, who had been with the crowd
at the church, gave the following account of it: "Not long ago, a Negro
knocked a white woman off the cars. It never appeared in the papers. I
never go on the cars where they [Negroes] are. You couldn't get me to go on
a State Street car line."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_587' name='Page_587' href='#Page_587'>587</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A barber at Forty-fifth Street and Emerald Avenue said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There was some trouble the Saturday before Labor Day. A Negro gave the conductor
a dollar bill, and the conductor said he hadn't change and told him to get off
the car. As he was getting off, he knocked against a white woman, and seven men
in an automobile who were right behind the car saw him and chased him. They
brought him up to the alley right across the street, beat him up, and cut up his head
something awful.

<h3>
IV. PROPAGANDA
</h3>

<p>
Both whites and Negroes have recognized the value of propaganda as an
instrument of opinion-making. Both employ it, sometimes openly, sometimes
insidiously. Its effects may be unmistakably observed in much of the literature
about the Negro. It is the purpose here to give attention to certain forms
of propaganda now in circulation, with a view to defining roughly their place
in the manufacture of sentiment on the race question in Chicago. In spite of
similarity it would be obviously unfair to lump all sorts of propaganda, good
and bad, under one general classification. It is possible, however, to classify
different types from the examples which came to the attention of the Commission,
as follows: (1) educational, (2) radical and revolutionary, (3) malicious,
(4) defensive.
</p>

<h4>
1. EDUCATIONAL PROPAGANDA
</h4>

<p>
Propaganda on the race situation with a true educational purpose seems
to be confined largely to organizations composed of both whites and Negroes,
who make joint appeals to both groups. An example is the publicity campaign
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
This Association definitely asserts that it can best accomplish its ends by
reaching "the conscience and heart of the American people," and publicity is
the weapon. The <i>Crisis</i> magazine is the principal organ of the Association,
although the public is reached through various other channels.
</p>

<p>
From the report of the Association for 1919, the following figures covering
the circulation of information is obtained: During that year 1,138,900 copies
of the <i>Crisis</i> were sold; officers of the Association traveled 101,009 miles,
delivered 286 addresses, including eleven in Chicago, and contributed nineteen
special articles, not including special releases, of press material to magazines
of wide circulation.
</p>

<h4>
2. RADICAL AND REVOLUTIONARY PROPAGANDA
</h4>

<p>
A broad basis of appeal to Negroes as a group is provided in their economic
status. Placed by circumstances near the bottom of the industrial ladder,
victims of exploitation, restlessly resentful of practices employed against them
because of class as well as race, it might be reasoned that they would be vitally
interested in a revolution, industrial if not social. The Industrial Workers of
the World has reasoned after this fashion and, probably because class meant
more to it than race, extended open arms to Negro workers. This appeal was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_588' name='Page_588' href='#Page_588'>588</a></span>
even stronger in view of the attitude of partial exclusion adopted by many
trades unions. To strengthen its organization, ally with it a restless group,
90 per cent of whom are laborers, while at the same time providing an unmistakable
demonstration of its own disregard for race lines in its so-called struggle
for "industrial freedom," the I.W.W. directed a definite propaganda toward
the Negro group, and founded it upon a very human desire. Thousands of
letters and pamphlets were addressed, "To the colored workingmen and
women," calling them fellow-workers. Excerpts from one of them follow:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There is one question which, more than any other, presses upon the mind of the
worker today, regardless of whether he be of one race or another, of one color or
another, the question of how he can improve his conditions, raise his wages, shorten
his hours of labor, and gain something more of freedom from his master, the owners
of the industry wherein he labors.
</p>

<p>
To the black race, who, but recently, with the assistance of the white men of the
northern states, broke their chains of bondage and ended chattel slavery, a prospect
of further freedom or <i>real freedom</i> should be most appealing.
</p>

<p>
For it is a fact that the Negro worker is no better off under the freedom he has
gained than under the slavery from which he has escaped. As chattel slaves we were
the property of our masters and, as a piece of valuable property, our masters were
considerate of us and careful of our health and welfare. Today, as wage workers, the
boss may work us to death, at the hardest and most hazardous labor, at the longest
hours, at the lowest pay, we may quietly starve when out of work and the boss loses
nothing by it and has no interest in us. To him the worker is but a machine for producing
profits and when you, as a slave who sells himself to the master on the installment
plan, become old, or broken in health or strength, or should you be killed while
at work, the master merely gets another wage slave on the same terms.
</p>

<p>
We who have worked in the South know that conditions in lumber and turpentine
camps, in the fields of cane, cotton and tobacco, in the mills and mines of Dixie, are
such that the workers suffer a more miserable existence than ever prevailed among the
chattel slaves before the great Civil War. Thousands of us have come and are coming
northward, crossing the Mason and Dixon line, seeking better conditions. As
wage slaves we have run away from the masters in the South, but to become the wage
slaves of the masters in the North. In the North we find that the hardest work and
the poorest pay are our portion. We are driven while on the job, and the high cost of
living offsets any higher pay we might receive.
</p>

<p>
The only problem then, which the colored worker should consider, as a worker, is
the problem of organization with other working men in the labor organization that
best expresses the interest of the whole working class against the slavery and oppression
of the whole capitalist class. Such an organization is the I.W.W., the <i>Industrial
Workers of the World</i>, the only labor union that has never, <i>in theory or practice</i>, since its
beginning, twelve years ago, barred the workers of any race or nation from membership.
The following has stood as a principle of the I.W.W., embodied in its official constitution
since its formation in 1905:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"By-Laws. Article Iâ€”Section 1
</p>

<p>
"No working man or woman shall be excluded from membership in Unions because
of creed or color."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_589' name='Page_589' href='#Page_589'>589</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
If you are a wage worker you are welcome in the I.W.W. halls, no matter what
your color. By this you may see that the I.W.W. is not a white man's union, not a
black man's union, not a red or yellow man's union, but a <i>working man's union</i>. <i>All
of the working class in one big union.</i>
</p>

<p>
In the I.W.W. all wage workers meet on common ground. No matter what language
you may speak, whether you were born in Europe, in Asia or in any other part
of the world, you will find a welcome as a fellow worker. In the harvest fields where
the I.W.W. controls, last summer saw white men, black men and Japanese working
together as union men and raising the pay of all who gathered the grain. In the great
strikes the I.W.W. has conducted at Lawrence, Massachusetts, in the woolen mills, in
the iron mills of Minnesota and elsewhere, the I.W.W. has brought the workers of
many races, colors and tongues together in victorious battles for a better life.
</p>

<p>
The foundation of the I.W.W. is <i>industrial unionism</i>. All workers in any division
of any industry are organized into an <i>industrial union of all</i> the workers in the <i>entire
industry</i>; these <i>industrial unions</i> in turn are organized into <i>industrial departments</i> of
connecting or kindred industries, while all are brought together in the <i>central organization
of the Industrial Workers of the Worldâ€”one big union of all the working class of the
world</i>. No one but actual wage workers may join. The working class cannot depend
upon anyone but itself to free it from wage slavery. "He who would be free, himself
must strike the blow."
</p>

<p>
When the I.W.W. through this form of <i>industrial unionism</i> has become powerful
enough, it will institute an <i>industrial commonwealth</i>; it will end slavery and oppression
forever and in its place will be a world of the workers, by the workers, and for the
workers, a world where there will be no poverty and want among those who feed and
clothe and house the world; a world where the word "master" and "slave" shall be
forgotten; a world where peace and happiness shall reign and where the children of
men shall live as brothers in a world-wide <i>industrial democracy</i>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another pamphlet published a hideous picture of a lynching in the South.
In both of these pamphlets the appeal is about the same and may be summarized
as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Negro is oppressed. He is subjected to the worst possible cruelties and indignities.
The working men are oppressed. Negroes have left one slavery for another
which is shared by white workers. Race hatred is played upon by capitalists to keep
the two races apart and thus thwart their efforts at improving their condition. The
I.W.W. union will unite all of the oppressed of all colors and all languages. One big
union of defensive brotherhood, not only in America but throughout the world.
</p>
</div>

<h4>
3. MALICIOUS PROPAGANDA
</h4>

<p>
Anti-Negro propaganda is not wholly new in the North, but it has usually
been carefully concealed. Recently there have been several conspicuous
instances of open and organized effort to influence the minds of white persons
against Negroes. The slogans, charges, and incriminations have included,
with gross exaggeration, not only all of the actual but all of the fancied and
rumored defects of Negro character. Ignorance and suspicion, fear and
prejudice, have been played upon violently. A group of South Side real
estate dealers and owners, anxious to preserve exclusively for whites sections of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_590' name='Page_590' href='#Page_590'>590</a></span>
the city known as Hyde Park and Kenwood, formed themselves into an organization
to protect property values on the assumption that the presence of
Negroes depreciated real estate values. Since they did not own or control
enough property to be in themselves effective, they sought to awaken the
white residents to the "danger that menaced them." Funds were raised,
meetings held, a journal started, bills and posters distributed, and many letters
circulated. A bulletin was widely distributed with this heading:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Your Rights and Mine</span>
<br />
A Short Symposium on Current Events as Applied to and Effecting Realty
Values in Kenwood and Hyde Park
</p>
</div>
<p>
It began by disclaiming any desire to foment or foster race antagonism,
but stated its determination to work insistently and persistently along legal
lines for the elimination of undesirables of whatever brand or color whose residence
in this section lowered the value of real estate. The remainder of the
bulletin, however, was devoted to a discussion of the Negro. A letter to Mayor
Thompson from the president of the Association mentioned the vicious element
of Negroes "haranguing about constitutional rights," aided by the Negro
press, claiming social equality, and then attributed the riot to the scattering
of Negroes in white residential sections. It spoke of a feeling that was
rampant because the "legal rights of Negroes have been placed above his moral
obligation to the white people." The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> was quoted twice and
the Chicago Real Estate Board once on the desirability of segregation. The
<i>Daily News</i> afforded a fourth quotation from an article in which three solutions
were advancedâ€”amalgamation, deportation, and segregation. As to
amalgamation the article said: "Every white man would rather see the nation
destroyed than adopt that method."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Property Owners' Journal</i> became so bitter in its utterances that the
protests of whites forced its discontinuance. A few selections from the <i>Journal</i>
picture the character of the campaign:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
What a reputation for beauty Chicago would secure if visitors touring the city
would see crowds of idle, insolent Negroes lounging on the South Side boulevards and
adding beauty to the floricultural display in the parks, filling the streets with old
newspapers and tomato containers and advertising the Poro-system for removing
the marcelled kinks from Negro hair in the windows of the derelict remains of what
had once been a clean, respectable residence.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">The New Negro</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Negroes are boasting, individually and through the colored press, that the old
order of things for the Negro is changing and that a new condition is about to begin.
As a result of the boastful attitude, the Negro is filled with bold ideas, the realization
of which means the overturning of their older views and conditions of life. The
Negro is unwilling to resume his status of other years; he is exalting himself with
idiotic ideas on social equality. Only a few days ago Attorney General Palmer
informed the Senate of the nation of the Negroes' boldest and most impudent ambition,
sex equality.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_591' name='Page_591' href='#Page_591'>591</a></span>
</p>

<p>
From the Negro viewpoint sex equality, according to Mr. Palmer, is not seen as
the equality of men and women; it is the assertion by the Negro of a right to marry
any person whom he chooses, regardless of color. The dangerous portion of their
outrageous idea does not consist in the accident that some black or white occasionally
may forget the dignity of their race and intermarry. That has happened before;
doubtless it will recur many times. Where the trouble lies is in the fact that the
Department of Justice has observed an organized tendency on the part of Negroes
to regard themselves in such a light as to permit their idea to become a universal
ambition of the Negro race.
</p>

<p>
As a corollary to their ambition on sex equality, it is not strange that they are
attempting to force their presence as neighbors on the whites. The effrontery and
impudence that nurses a desire on the part of the Negro to choose a white as a marriage
mate certainly will not result in making the Negro a desirable neighbor. That fact
alone is enough to determine the property owners of this district to declare to the
Negroes that they must stay out. As neighbors they have nothing to offer. "They
lived for uncounted centuries in Africa on their own resources, and never so much as
improved the make-up of an arrow, coined a new word, or crept an inch nearer to a
spiritual religion," and it is a certainty that their tenure of those unfortunate buildings
now occupied by them will not be improved by a single nail if it is left to the
Negro to provide and drive the nail.
</p>

<p>
Keep the Negro in his place, amongst his people, and he is healthy and loyal.
Remove him, or allow "his newly discovered importance to remove him from his
proper environment and the Negro becomes a nuisance." He develops into an
overbearing, inflated, irascible individual, overburdening his brain to such an extent
about social equality that he becomes dangerous to all with whom he comes in contact;
he constitutes a nuisance of which the neighborhood is anxious to rid itself. If
the new Negro desires to display his newly acquired veneer of impudence where it
will be appreciated we advise that they parade it in their own district. Their presence
here is intolerable.
</p>

<p>
As stated before, every colored man who moves into Hyde Park knows that he
is damaging his white neighbor's property.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, he is making war on the white man.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, he is not entitled to any consideration and forfeits his right to be
employed by the white man.
</p>

<p>
If employers should adopt a rule of refusing to employ Negroes who reside in
Hyde Park to the damage of the white man's property it would soon show good results.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Food for Thought for Hyde-Parkers</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Their solid vote is the Negroes' great weapon. They have a total vote in Chicago
of about 40,000. This total vote is cast solid for the candidate who makes the best
bargain with them. When both our principal political parties are split, and when
each of them has two or more candidates in the field, this solid block of 40,000 becomes
a possible power and might be able to defeat or elect a candidate.
</p>

<p>
This vote situation is the foundation of the Chicago Negro's effrontery and his
evil design against the white man's property. He feels that he holds the balance of
power and that he can dictate the policy of any administration that happens to be
elected by his controlling black vote.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_592' name='Page_592' href='#Page_592'>592</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He therefore becomes arrogant, insulting, threatening. He abuses his rights
and liberties and feels that he is perfectly safe in doing so for the reason that as he
controls this block of votes he believes that he can practically dictate to the police
department, the city administration and the courts. Consequently he is bold.
</p>

<p>
Now then, white property owners and voters, this vote situation must be corrected.
It is time for you to think and ponder. Remember this, that this Negro
vote power could not exist except for the fact that the candidate who caters to it is
traveling on his belief that the white man will vote the ticket any way. The white
voter is not supposed to think, nor to indulge in any investigations of a candidate to
ascertain whether or not the candidate is favorable or inimical to his interests. No,
the white voter is supposed to be a blind ass who has no care for his own interests, who
does not know or care to know of the foul plots against him, who has no knowledge of
what is going on around him, but who simply does as he is told and walks to the polls
as in a dream, having eyes and seeing not, ears and hearing not, and religiously casts
his vote for the ticket and against his own interests.
</p>

<p>
Wake up, white voters! Come out of your dream. Open your eyes and ears.
It is high time that you realize what is going on. Hereafter in local affairs affecting
your property and home interests, there should be only one test of a candidate and that
one should be, "Will his election work for the betterment of Hyde Park or for its deterioration?"
</p>

<p>
The Negro should be consistent. As he segregates his vote and casts it all together
in one block, so he should live together all in one block.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Some of the slogans of the organization were: "Our neighborhood must
continue white"; "They shall not pass"; "Stay out of Hyde Park"; "We
base our rights on priority, majority and anthropological superiority."
</p>

<p>
The sentiment was contagious.<a name='FA_102' id='FA_102' href='#FN_102' class='fnanchor'>[102]</a> Other literature of even more pronounced
anti-Negro character followed. An unsigned card was distributed in large
numbers throughout the district during the presidential campaign, showing
a vicious looking Negro and words of warning for family protection.
</p>

<p>
The attempt still further to instill fear and bitterness was manifest in a
pamphlet sent, by whom it is not known, to the wives of prominent white
residents of the city and particularly of Hyde Park, entitled <i>An Appeal
of White Women to American Womanhood</i>. It was a reprint from an article in
the <i>New Times</i>, which in turn reprinted an appeal from the <i>German Women on
the Rhine</i>. Although there could be slight connection between the conduct
of colored French colonial troops on the Rhine and Chicago Negroes, its
circulation in Hyde Park possibly helped to fan the flames of race feeling which
had already been so deliberately kindled. The pamphlet detailed the "bestial
ferocious conduct of Negroes against German women."
</p>

<h4>
4. DEFENSIVE PROPAGANDA
</h4>

<p>
Within the Negro group there are to be found many defensive programs
designed for group protection. They rarely reach the point of organized
effort for the control of opinion. The essence in all appeals is "protest,"
which is tacitly understood to be an effective sentiment to circulate. The most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_593' name='Page_593' href='#Page_593'>593</a></span>
striking illustrations of this type of propaganda are those which follow definite
provocations. The appeal of the propaganda is directed first to Negroes as
a means of cementing the group from within, and indirectly to the whole group
by way of impressing it with the strength of solidified opposition to insults.
One example of this type will suffice.
</p>

<p>
Following the bombing of Negro homes and the inauguration of a campaign
of reckless propaganda against Negroes in the interest of exclusive white
residence neighborhoods, Negroes organized the "Protective Circle of Chicago."
The object of this organization was to "oppose segregation, bombing and the
defiance of the Constitution." The admitted method of combating these
objectionable practices was propaganda. The question on which certain white
people living in Hyde Park were greatly wrought up was that of keeping
Negroes out of "white residential districts." Negroes were classed as "undesirables,"
and the efforts of the whites in offensive propaganda were aimed at
proving it. Fortunately for the Negroes, an article appeared in a real estate
publication, the <i>Real Estate News</i>, presenting with unusual force an aspect
of the neighborhood dispute favorable to the contention of the Negroes.
This was seized upon by the Protective Circle, and the editor consented to
elaborate it. Twenty-five thousand copies were distributed among Negroes
and whites, residents of the district.
</p>

<p>
The heading "Solving Chicago's Race Problem," coupled with the fact
that the article had first appeared in a real estate periodical published by
whites, immediately attracted attention. The subheadings of the article read:
"South Side Property Owners Warned against Perils of Boycott and Terrorism
Being Promoted by Local 'Protective Associations,'" "Conspiracies Violating
Civil Rights Act Bring Danger of Heavy Damages or Imprisonment," "A
Complete Analysis of Chicago's Race Movement Proves It to Be Small Factor
in Causing Great Changes in Residential Values," and "How Influence of
Stock Yards, Railroads, Auto Industry and City Growth Force Big and Sweeping
Changes on South Side of Chicago." One paragraph of the article, printed
in italics, ran:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Any association formed in Chicago for the purpose of, or having among its aims,
refusal to sell, lease or rent property to any citizen of a certain race, is an unlawful
association. Every act of such an association for advancement of such an aim is an
act of conspiracy, punishable criminally and civilly in the District Court of the United
States. And every member of such an association is equally guilty with every other
member. If one member hires a bomber, or a thug who commits murder in pursuance
of the aims of the association, all in the organization may be found guilty of conspiracy
to destroy property or to commit murder, as the case may be.
</p>
</div>

<p>
At a mass meeting held by the Protective Circle at which there were 2,000
Negroes present, $1,000 was collected to advance this propaganda. As the
chairman of the meeting stated:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We wanted to get at the responsibility for these bombings and intimidations, and
we intended to give publicity to the Negro's side of the story. Papers will not print
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_594' name='Page_594' href='#Page_594'>594</a></span>
the Negro's story. We wanted to get this survey of white and colored property owned,
and whites and Negroes bombed, and send it to every white person living in Kenwood,
and just as we were about to start on our task, there came like a flash out of the sky
an article by the editor of the <i>Real Estate News</i>. It was a godsend. We have secured
thousands of copies of this paper and are buying more as fast as we can get funds.
We intend to send copies to every white person interested in this question.
</p>
</div>

<h3>
V. CONCLUSIONS
</h3>

<p>
The inquiries of this Commission into racial sentiments which characterize
the opinions and behavior of white persons toward Negroes lead us to the
following conclusions:
</p>

<p>
That in seeking advice and information about Negroes, white persons
almost without exception fail to select for their informants Negroes who are
representative and can provide dependable information.
</p>

<p>
That Negroes as a group are often judged by the manners, conduct, and
opinions of servants in families, or other Negroes whose general standing and
training do not qualify them to be spokesmen of the group.
</p>

<p>
That the principal literature regarding Negroes is based upon traditional
opinions and does not always portray accurately the present status of the
group.
</p>

<p>
Most of the current beliefs concerning Negroes are traditional, and were
acquired during an earlier period when Negroes were considerably less intelligent
and responsible than now. Failure to change these opinions, in spite of
the great progress of the Negro group, increases misunderstandings and the
difficulties of mutual adjustment.
</p>

<p>
That the common disposition to regard all Negroes as belonging to one
homogeneous group is as great a mistake as to assume that all white persons
are of the same class and kind.
</p>

<p>
That much of the current literature and pseudo-scientific treatises concerning
Negroes are responsible for such prevailing misconceptions as: that Negroes
have inferior mentality; that Negroes have inferior morality; that Negroes
are given to emotionalism; that Negroes have an innate tendency to commit
crimes, especially sex crimes.
</p>

<p>
We believe that such deviations from recognized standards as have been
apparent among Negroes are due to circumstances of position rather than to
distinct racial traits. We urge especially upon white persons to exert their
efforts toward discrediting stories and standing beliefs concerning Negroes
which have no basis in fact but which constantly serve to keep alive a spirit
of mutual fear, distrust, and opposition.
</p>

<p>
That much of the literature and scientific treatises concerning Negroes
are responsible for such prevailing misconceptions as that Negroes are capable
of mental and moral development only to an inferior degree, are given to an
uncontrolled emotionalism, and have a distinctive innate tendency to commit
crimes, especially sex crimes.

SUMMARY OF THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE COMMISSION</span>
</h2>

<h3>
THE SUMMARY
</h3>

<h3>
I. <span class="smcap">The Chicago Riot</span>
</h3>

<h4>
1. BACKGROUND
</h4>

<p>
In July, 1919, a race riot involving whites and Negroes occurred in Chicago.
For some time thoughtful citizens, white and Negro, had sensed increasing
tension, but, having no local precedent of riot and wholesale bloodshed, had
neither prepared themselves for it nor taken steps to prevent it. The collecting
of arms by members of both races was known to the authorities, and it was
evident that this was in preparation for aggression as well as for self-defense.
</p>

<p>
Several minor clashes preceded the riot. On July 3, 1917, a white saloon-keeper
who, according to the coroner's physician, died of heart trouble, was
incorrectly reported in the press to have been killed by a Negro. That evening
a party of young white men riding in an automobile fired upon a group of
Negroes at Fifty-third and Federal streets. In July and August of the same
year recruits from the Great Lakes Naval Training Station clashed frequently
with Negroes, each side accusing the other of being the aggressor.
</p>

<p>
Gangs of white "toughs," made up largely of the membership of so-called
"athletic clubs" from the neighborhood between Roosevelt Road and Sixty-third
Street, Wentworth Avenue and the city limitsâ€”a district contiguous to
the neighborhood of the largest Negro settlementâ€”were a constant menace to
Negroes who traversed sections of the territory going to and returning from work.
The activities of these gangs and "athletic clubs" became bolder in the spring
of 1919, and on the night of June 21, five weeks before the riot, two wanton
murders of Negroes occurred, those of Sanford Harris and Joseph Robinson.
Harris returning to his home on Dearborn Street, about 11:30 at night, passed
a group of young white men. They threatened him and he ran. He had gone
but a short distance when one of the group shot him. He died soon afterward.
Policemen who came on the scene made no arrests, even when the assailant
was pointed out by a white woman witness of the murder. On the same
evening Robinson, a Negro laborer, forty-seven years of age, was attacked
while returning from work by a gang of white "roughs" at Fifty-fifth Street
and Princeton Avenue, apparently without provocation, and stabbed to death.
</p>

<p>
Negroes were greatly incensed over these murders, but their leaders,
joined by many friendly whites, tried to allay their fears and counseled patience.
</p>

<p>
After the killing of Harris and Robinson notices were conspicuously posted
on the South Side that an effort would be made to "get all the niggers on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_596' name='Page_596' href='#Page_596'>596</a></span>
July 4th." The notices called for help from sympathizers. Negroes in turn
whispered around the warning to prepare for a riot; and they did prepare.
</p>

<p>
Since the riot in East St. Louis, July 4, 1917, there had been others in
different parts of the country which evidenced a widespread lack of restraint
in mutual antipathies and suggested further resorts to lawlessness. Riots
and race clashes occurred in Chester, Pennsylvania; Longview, Texas; Coatesville,
Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; and Norfolk, Virginia, before the
Chicago riot.
</p>

<p>
Aside from general lawlessness and disastrous riots that preceded the riot
here discussed, there were other factors which may be mentioned briefly here.
In Chicago considerable unrest had been occasioned in industry by increasing
competition between white and Negro laborers following a sudden increase in
the Negro population due to the migration of Negroes from the South. This
increase developed a housing crisis. The Negroes overran the hitherto recognized
area of Negro residence, and when they took houses in adjoining
neighborhoods friction ensued. In the two years just preceding the riot,
twenty-seven Negro dwellings were wrecked by bombs thrown by unidentified
persons.
</p>

<h4>
2. STORY OF THE RIOT
</h4>

<p>
Sunday afternoon, July 27, 1919, hundreds of white and Negro bathers
crowded the lake-front beaches at Twenty-sixth and Twenty-ninth streets.
This is the eastern boundary of the thickest Negro residence area. At Twenty-sixth
Street Negroes were in great majority; at Twenty-ninth Street there were
more whites. An imaginary line in the water separating the two beaches
had been generally observed by the two races. Under the prevailing relations,
aided by wild rumors and reports, this line served virtually as a challenge to
either side to cross it. Four Negroes who attempted to enter the water from
the "white" side were driven away by the whites. They returned with more
Negroes, and there followed a series of attacks with stones, first one side gaining
the advantage, then the other.
</p>

<p>
Eugene Williams, a Negro boy of seventeen, entered the water from the
side used by Negroes and drifted across the line supported by a railroad tie.
He was observed by the crowd on the beach and promptly became a target
for stones. He suddenly released the tie, went down and was drowned.
Guilt was immediately placed on Stauber, a young white man, by Negro
witnesses who declared that he threw the fatal stone.<a name='FA_103' id='FA_103' href='#FN_103' class='fnanchor'>[103]</a>
</p>

<p>
White and Negro men dived for the boy without result. Negroes
demanded that the policeman present arrest Stauber. He refused; and at
this crucial moment arrested a Negro on a white man's complaint. Negroes
then attacked the officer. These two facts, the drowning and the refusal
of the policeman to arrest Stauber, together marked the beginning of the riot.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_597' name='Page_597' href='#Page_597'>597</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Two hours after the drowning, a Negro, James Crawford, fired into a
group of officers summoned by the policeman at the beach and was killed by
a Negro policeman. Reports and rumors circulated rapidly, and new crowds
began to gather. Five white men were injured in clashes near the beach.
As darkness came Negroes in white districts to the west suffered severely.
Between 9:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and 3:00 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> twenty-seven Negroes were beaten, seven
stabbed, and four shot. Monday morning was quiet, and Negroes went to
work as usual.
</p>

<p>
Returning from work in the afternoon many Negroes were attacked by
white ruffians. Street-car routes, especially at transfer points, were the
centers of lawlessness. Trolleys were pulled from the wires, and Negro
passengers were dragged into the street, beaten, stabbed, and shot. The police
were powerless to cope with these numerous assaults. During Monday, four
Negro men and one white assailant were killed, and thirty Negroes were
severely beaten in street-car clashes. Four white men were killed, six stabbed,
five shot, and nine severely beaten. It was rumored that the white occupants
of the Angelus Building at Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash Avenue had shot
a Negro. Negroes gathered about the building. The white tenants sought
police protection, and one hundred policemen, mounted and on foot,
responded. In a clash with the mob the police killed four Negroes and injured
many.
</p>

<p>
Raids into the Negro residence area then began. Automobiles sped
through the streets, the occupants shooting at random. Negroes retaliated
by "sniping" from ambush. At midnight surface and elevated car service
was discontinued because of a strike for wage increases, and thousands of
employees were cut off from work.
</p>

<p>
On Tuesday, July 29, Negro men en route on foot to their jobs through
hostile territory were killed. White soldiers and sailors in uniform, aided by
civilians, raided the "Loop" business section, killing two Negroes and beating
and robbing several others. Negroes living among white, neighbors in
Englewood, far to the south, were driven from their homes, their household
goods were stolen, and their houses were burned or wrecked. On the West
Side an Italian mob, excited by a false rumor that an Italian girl had been
shot by a Negro, killed Joseph Lovings, a Negro.
</p>

<p>
Wednesday night at 10:30 Mayor Thompson yielded to pressure and asked
the help of the three regiments of militia which had been stationed in nearby
armories during the most severe rioting, awaiting the call. They immediately
took up positions throughout the South Side. A rainfall Wednesday night
and Thursday kept many people in their homes, and by Friday the rioting had
abated. On Saturday incendiary fires burned forty-nine houses in the immigrant
neighborhood west of the Stock Yards. Nine hundred and forty-eight
people, mostly Lithuanians, were made homeless, and the property loss was
about $250,000. Responsibility for the fires was never fixed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_598' name='Page_598' href='#Page_598'>598</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The total casualties of this reign of terror were thirty-eight deathsâ€”fifteen
white, twenty-three Negroâ€”and 537 people injured. Forty-one per
cent of the reported clashes occurred in the white neighborhood near the Stock
Yards between the south branch of the Chicago River and Fifty-fifth Street,
Wentworth Avenue and the city limits, and 34 per cent in the "Black Belt"
between Twenty-second and Thirty-ninth streets, Wentworth Avenue and
Lake Michigan. Others were scattered.
</p>

<p>
Responsibility for many attacks was definitely placed by many witnesses
upon the "athletic clubs," including "Ragen's Colts," the "Hamburgers,"
"Aylwards," "Our Flag," the "Standard," the "Sparklers," and several
others. The mobs were made up for the most part of boys between fifteen
and twenty-two. Older persons participated, but the youth of the rioters
was conspicuous in every clash. Little children witnessed the brutalities
and frequently pointed out the injured when the police arrived.
</p>

<h4>
3. RUMORS AND THE RIOT
</h4>

<p>
Wild rumors were in circulation by word of mouth and in the press throughout
the riot and provoked many clashes. These included stories of atrocities
committed by one race against the other. Reports of the numbers of white
and Negro dead tended to produce a feeling that the score must be kept even.
Newspaper reports, for example, showed 6 per cent more whites injured than
Negroes. As a matter of fact there were 28 per cent more Negroes injured than
whites. The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> on July 29 reported twenty persons killed, of
whom thirteen were white and seven colored. The true figures were exactly
the opposite.
</p>

<p>
Among the rumors provoking fear were numerous references to the arming
of Negroes. In the <i>Daily News</i> of July 30, for example, appeared the subheadline:
"Alderman Jos. McDonough tells how he was shot at on South
Side visit. Says enough ammunition in section to last for years of guerrilla
warfare." In the article following, the reference to ammunition was repeated
but not elaborated or explained.
</p>

<p>
The alderman was quoted as saying that the mayor contemplated opening
up Thirty-fifth and Forty-seventh streets in order that colored people might
get to their work. He thought this would be most unwise for, he stated,
"They are armed and white people are not. We must defend ourselves if the
city authorities won't protect us." Continuing his story, he described bombs
going off: "I saw white men and women running through the streets dragging
children by the hands and carrying babies in their arms. Frightened white
men told me the police captains had just rushed through the district crying,
'For God's sake, arm; they are coming; we cannot hold them.'"
</p>

<p>
Whether or not the alderman was correctly quoted, the effect of such statements
on the public was the same. There is no record in any of the riot testimony
in the coroner's office or state's attorney's office of any bombs going off
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_599' name='Page_599' href='#Page_599'>599</a></span>
during the riot, nor of police captains warning the white people to arm, nor
of any fear by whites of a Negro invasion. In the Berger Odman case before
a coroner's jury there was a statement to the effect that a sergeant of police
warned the Negroes of Ogden Park to arm and to shoot at the feet of rioters
if they attempted to invade the few blocks marked off for Negroes by the
police. Negroes were warned, not whites.
</p>

<h4>
4. CONDUCT OF THE POLICE
</h4>

<p>
Chief of Police John J. Garrity, in explaining the inability of the police
to curb the rioters, said that there was not a sufficient force to police one-third
of the city. Aside from this, Negroes distrusted the white police officers,
and it was implied by the chief and stated by State's Attorney Hoyne, that
many of the police were "grossly unfair in making arrests." There were
instances of actual police participation in the rioting as well as neglect of duty.
Of 229 persons arrested and accused of various criminal activities during the
riot, 154 were Negroes and seventy-five were whites. Of those indicted,
eighty-one were Negroes and forty-seven were whites. Although this, on its
face, would indicate great riot activity on the part of Negroes, further reports
of clashes show that of 520 persons injured, 342 were Negroes and 178 were
whites. The fact that twice as many Negroes appeared as defendants and
twice as many Negroes as whites were injured, leads to the conclusion that
whites were not apprehended as readily as Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Many of the depredations outside the "Black Belt" were encouraged by
the absence of policemen. Out of a force of 3,000 police, 2,800 were massed
in the "Black Belt" during the height of the rioting. In the "Loop" district,
where two Negroes were killed and several others wounded, there were only
three policemen and one sergeant. The Stock Yards district, where the
greatest number of injuries occurred, was also weakly protected.
</p>

<h4>
5. THE MILITIA
</h4>

<p>
Although Governor Lowden had ordered the militia into the city promptly
and they were on hand on the second day of the rioting, their services were
not requested by the mayor and chief of police until the evening of the
fourth day. The reason expressed by the chief for this delay was a belief
that inexperienced militiamen would add to the deaths and disorder. But
the troops, when called, proved to be clearly of high character, and their
discipline was good, not a case of breach of discipline being reported during
their occupation. They were distributed more proportionately through all the
riotous areas than the police and, although they reported some hostility from
members of "athletic clubs," the rioting soon ceased.
</p>

<h4>
6. RESTORATION OF ORDER
</h4>

<p>
Throughout the rioting various social organizations and many citizens were
at work trying to hold hostilities in check and to restore order. The Chicago
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_600' name='Page_600' href='#Page_600'>600</a></span>
Urban League, Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A., American Red Cross, and various
other social organizations and the churches of the Negro community gave
attention to caring for stranded Negroes, advising them of dangers, keeping
them off the streets and, in such ways as were possible, co-operating with the
police. The packing companies took their pay to Negro employees, and
various banks made loans. Local newspapers in their editorial columns
insistently condemned the disorder and counseled calmness.
</p>

<h4>
7. THE AFTERMATH
</h4>

<p>
Of the thirty-eight persons killed in the riot:
</p>

<p>
Fifteen met death at the hands of mobs. Coroner's juries recommended
that the members of the unknown mobs be apprehended. They were never
found.
</p>

<p>
Six were killed in circumstances fixing no criminal responsibility: three
white men were killed by Negroes in self-defense, and three Negroes were
shot by policemen in the discharge of their duty.
</p>

<p>
Four Negroes were killed in the Angelus riot. The coroner made no
recommendations, and the cases were not carried farther.
</p>

<p>
Four cases, two Negro and two white, resulted in recommendations from
coroner's juries for further investigation of certain persons. Sufficient evidence
was lacking for indictments against them.
</p>

<p>
Nine cases led to indictments. Of this number four cases resulted in
convictions.
</p>

<p>
Thus in only four cases of death was criminal responsibility fixed and
punishment meted out.
</p>

<p>
Indictments and convictions, divided according to the race of the persons
criminally involved, were as follows:
</p>

<div class="numtab">
<table summary="Indictments and Convictions">

<td class="tdr">2</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
Despite the community's failure to deal firmly with those who disturbed
its peace and contributed to the reign of lawlessness that shamed Chicago
before the world, there is evidence that the riot aroused many citizens of both
races to a quickened sense of the suffering and disgrace which had come and
might again come to the city, and developed a determination to prevent a
recurrence of so disastrous an outbreak of race hatred. This was manifest
on at least three occasions in 1920 when, confronted suddenly with events
out of which serious riots might easily have grown, people of both races
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_601' name='Page_601' href='#Page_601'>601</a></span>
acted with such courage and promptness as to end the trouble early. One of
these was the murder of two innocent white men and the wounding of a
Negro policeman by a band of Negro fanatics who styled themselves "Abyssinians";
another was the killing of a white man by a Negro whom he had
attacked while returning from work; and still another was the riotous attacks
of sailors from the Great Lakes Naval Training Station on Negroes in
Waukegan, Illinois.
</p>

<h4>
8. OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF THE RIOT
</h4>

<p>
This study of the facts of the riot of 1919, the events as they happened
hour by hour, the neighborhoods involved, the movements of mobs, the part
played by rumors, and the handling of the emergency by the various authorities,
shows certain outstanding features which may be listed as follows:
</p>

<p>
<i>a</i>) The riot violence was not continuous hour by hour, but was intermittent.
</p>

<p>
<i>b</i>) The greatest number of injuries occurred in the district west and
inclusive of Wentworth Avenue, and south of the south branch of the Chicago
River to Fifty-fifth Street, or in the Stock Yards district. The next greatest
number occurred in the so-called "Black Belt": Twenty-second to Thirty-ninth
streets, inclusive, and Wentworth Avenue to the lake, exclusive of
Wentworth Avenue; Thirty-ninth to Fifty-fifth streets, inclusive, and Clark
Street to Michigan Avenue, exclusive of Michigan Avenue.
</p>

<p>
<i>c</i>) Organized raids occurred only after a period of sporadic clashes and
spontaneous mob outbreaks.
</p>

<p>
<i>d</i>) Main thoroughfares witnessed 76 per cent of the injuries on the South
Side. The streets which suffered most severely were State, Halsted, Thirty-first,
Thirty-fifth, and Forty-seventh. Transfer corners were always centers
of disturbances.
</p>

<p>
<i>e</i>) Most of the rioting occurred after work hours among idle crowds on
the streets. This was particularly true after the street-car strike began.
</p>

<p>
<i>f</i>) Gangs, particularly of young whites, formed definite nuclei for crowd
and mob formation. "Athletic clubs" supplied the leaders of many gangs.
</p>

<p>
<i>g</i>) Crowds and mobs engaged in rioting were generally composed of a
small nucleus of leaders and an acquiescing mass of spectators. The leaders
were mostly young men, usually between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one.
Dispersal was most effectively accomplished by sudden, unexpected
gun fire.
</p>

<p>
<i>h</i>) Rumor kept the crowds in an excited, potential mob state. The press
was responsible for giving wide dissemination to much of the inflammatory
matter in spoken rumors, though editorials calculated to allay race hatred
and help the forces of order were factors in the restoration of peace.
</p>

<p>
<i>i</i>) The police lacked sufficient forces for handling the riot; they were
hampered by the Negroes' distrust of them; routing orders and records were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_602' name='Page_602' href='#Page_602'>602</a></span>
not handled with proper care; certain officers were undoubtedly unsuited to
police or riot duty.
</p>

<p>
<i>j</i>) The militiamen employed in this riot were of an unusually high type.
This unquestionably accounts for the confidence placed in them by both races.
Riot training, definite orders, and good staff work contributed to their efficiency.
</p>

<p>
<i>k</i>) There was a lack of energetic co-operation between the police department
and the state's attorney's office in the discovery and conviction of rioters.
</p>

<p>
The riot was merely a symptom of serious and profound disorders lying
beneath the surface of race relations in Chicago. The study of the riot, therefore,
as to its interlocking provocations and causes, required a study of general
race relations that made possible so serious and sudden an outbreak. Thus
to understand the riot and guard against another, the Commission probed
systematically into the principal phases of race contact and sought accurate
information on matters which in the past have been influenced by dangerous
speculation; and on the basis of its discoveries certain suggestions to the
community are made.
</p>

<h3>
II. <span class="smcap">The Migration of Negroes from the South</span>
</h3>

<p>
During the period 1916-18 approximately 500,000 Negroes moved from
southern to northern states. Some cities of the North received increases
in Negro population of 10 per cent to 300 per cent. The Negro population
of Gary, Indiana, increased from 383 in 1910 to 5,299 in 1920, an increase
of 1,283 per cent.
</p>

<p>
Chicago was in direct line for migrants from the South, especially along
the Mississippi Valley, and received approximately 65,000, who constituted a
large proportion of the increase of 148.5 per cent in its Negro population in
the last decade. These migrants definitely accentuated existing problems
of race contact and brought new problems of adjustment and assimilation.
Southern Negroes with southern manners, habits, and traditions, and mostly
from rural districts, became part of a northern urban community. Knowledge
of the causes of this movement of Negroes will make easier an understanding
of the difficulties following it. These causes were economic as well
as sentimental.
</p>

<p>
The South was paying to Negroes wages which varied from 75 cents a day
on a farm to $1.75 a day in certain city jobs. For two seasons the boll weevil,
a destructive pest, had been making heavy ravages upon the cotton crops,
ruining thousands of farms and throwing out of employment many thousands
of Negro workers. Lack of capital to carry labor through a period of poor
crops and over the normal intervals between planting and harvesting largely
increased Negro unemployment. Unsatisfactory living conditions, on plantations
and in segregated quarters of southern cities, stimulated unrest. School
facilities for Negro children, described as lamentably poor even by southerners,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_603' name='Page_603' href='#Page_603'>603</a></span>
increased dissatisfaction with conditions in the South. The Negro illiteracy
in fifteen southern states was 33.3 per cent as compared with 7.7 per cent
for whites. The appropriations for teachers in the schools of these states on
a per capita basis was $10.32 for each white child, and $2.89 for each Negro child.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the North was for the first time on a large scale opening
up opportunities for Negroes to earn a livelihood. The cessation of immigration
due to the war and the drawing of workers into military service
created a great demand for labor; and the opening of new industries and the
extension of old ones to meet the demands of the war provided still greater
opportunities. At the same time, these industries were paying laborers
from $3 to $8 per day, and offering shorter hours and the opportunity for
overtime work and bonuses. The North also offered living accommodations
which, although below standard for city dwellers, were a vast improvement
over most of the plantation cabins and frail frame dwellings of the South.
There are no segregated schools in the North, and Negro children are offered
identical school privileges with white children.
</p>

<p>
Other causes of the migration, as stated by the migrants and otherwise
confirmed, were: lack of protection from mob violence, injustice in the courts,
inferior transportation facilities, deprivation of the right to vote, "rough-handed
and unfair competition of 'poor whites,'" "persecution by petty
officers of the law," and "persecution by the press."
</p>

<p>
Between 1895 and 1918, 2,881 Negroes were lynched in the United States,
and more than 85 per cent of these lynchings occurred in the South. The
<i>Atlanta Constitution</i> declared that the heaviest migration of Negroes was
from those counties in which there had been the worst outbreaks against
Negroes.
</p>

<p>
<i>How the migration began.</i>â€”The migration began early in 1916. Hard-pressed
industries in the East, principally in Pennsylvania, imported Negroes
from Georgia and Florida. During July of that year, 13,000 were carried to
Pennsylvania by one railroad company alone.<a name='FA_104' id='FA_104' href='#FN_104' class='fnanchor'>[104]</a> They wrote back for their
families and friends. Reports of high wages and good treatment, aided by
the hysteria of a mass movement, accomplished the rest.
</p>

<p>
The migration was first noted in Chicago in 1917. It had been rumored
in the South that the Stock Yards needed 50,000 men; the city had been
regarded by Negroes as a future home since the World's Columbian Exposition
in 1893; it was the great city of mail-order houses, the home of the <i>Chicago
Defender</i>, a widely circulated Negro newspaper, the "end of the railroad line,"
and the "top of the world" for Negroes. Negro newspapers gave up their
columns to migration news and urged southern Negroes to go North. The
movement soon became a mass movement; with standards, songs, and watchwords
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_604' name='Page_604' href='#Page_604'>604</a></span>
the migrants began arriving in the city faster than they could be absorbed
into the population.
</p>

<p>
<i>The arrival in Chicago.</i>â€”Prior to the migration, the majority of Negroes
in Chicago lived in a fairly limited area on the South Side, principally between
Twenty-second and Thirty-ninth streets, Wentworth Avenue and State
Street, and in scattered groups east of State Street to Cottage Grove Avenue.
This area adjoined the old vice area, and many houses of the vicinity had
been abandoned by older Chicago Negroes. Shortly after the migrants
began to arrive, practically all available houses had been taken and filled to
overcrowding. On a single day the Chicago Urban League found 664 Negro
applicants for houses with only fifty-five dwellings actually available for use
by Negroes. At the same time rents for Negroes were increased by from
5 to 50 per cent.
</p>

<p>
Meeting actual conditions of life in Chicago brought both exaltation and
disillusionment to the migrants. These were reflected in the schools, in public
amusement places, in industry, and in the street cars. The Chicago Urban
League and the various Negro churches and newspapers assumed the task of
making the newcomers "city folk." The difficulty of adjustment showed
itself in the great differences in habits of life and employment. Craftsmen
had to relearn their trades when thrown amid the highly specialized processes
of northern industries; domestic servants went into industry; professional
men had to re-establish themselves in a new community.
</p>

<p>
Many Negroes sold their homes in the South and brought their furniture
with them. Reinvesting in property frequently meant a loss; the furniture
brought was often found to be unsuited to the tiny apartments or the large
abandoned dwellings that they were able to rent or buy.
</p>

<p>
Change of residence carried with it in many cases change of status. The
"leader" in a small southern community when he came to Chicago was
immediately absorbed into the great, struggling mass of unnoticed workers.
School teachers, male and female, whose positions in the South held commendable
prestige, had to go to work in factories and plants because the disparity
in educational standards would not permit a continuation of their profession
in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
The migrants visited by the Commission investigators, however, for the
most part gave evidence of satisfaction with their change of home, and were
pleased with the opportunity of voting, of sending their children to schools,
and of higher wages, and with the privilege of participation in community
life. Others felt the pressure of high rents and bad living accommodations
and complained against certain discriminations.
</p>

<p>
The fact is, however, that few Negroes have returned to the South, even
in response to insistent invitations and offers of free transportation and better
home conditions made by southern states that were left badly in need of
laborers as a result of the migration.

<h3>
III. <span class="smcap">The Negro Population of Chicago</span>
</h3>

<h4>
1. DISTRIBUTION AND DENSITY
</h4>

<p>
The Negro population of Chicago, as reported by the Federal Bureau of
the Census, was 44,103 in 1910, and 109,594 in 1920. The increase during
the decade was, therefore, 65,491, or 148.5 per cent. Negroes constituted
2 per cent of the city's total population in 1910 and 4.1 per cent in 1920. The
increase in the white population during the decade was 450,047, or 21 per cent,
bringing the number up to 2,589,104 in 1920. Counting 3,007 Chinese,
Japanese, and Indians of whom there were 2,123 in 1910, Chicago's total
population in 1920 was 2,701,705.
</p>

<p>
This growth of the Negro population did not bring into existence any
new large colonies of Negroes, but merely expanded and increased the density
of areas in which they already lived. The areas of Negro residence are listed
under designations arbitrarily given for convenient reference.<a name='FA_105' id='FA_105' href='#FN_105' class='fnanchor'>[105]</a>

<h4>
2. NEIGHBORHOODS OF NEGRO RESIDENCE
</h4>

<p>
<i>The South Side.</i>â€”While the main colony of Chicago's Negro population
is located in a central part of the South Side, Negroes are to be found in several
parts of the city, ranging from less than 1 per cent to more than 95 per cent
in proportion to the total population. In some of these neighborhoods whites
and Negroes have become adjusted to one another; in others they have not.
One of these adjusted areas is the so-called "Black Belt." Because 90 per
cent of the Negroes of Chicago live there, it is usually assumed that the area
is 90 per cent Negro. The fact is very different. The most densely populated
section of the South Side area, between Roosevelt Road and Thirty-ninth
Street, Wentworth Avenue and Lake Michigan, has a population of 54,906
Negroes and 42,797 whites. There has been no noticeable friction in this
area; and even during the riot few whites living or engaged in business there
were molested by Negroes. Most of the whites killed or injured there came
from other sections of the city. The many large apartment houses and family
hotels occupied by whites are apparently little affected by the presence about
them of many Negroes. Relations in Woodlawn, where the Negro increase
has been relatively large, are for the most part friendly. No clashes have
been reported except in the one instance of a group of white boys who threw
stones at a building in which they saw Negroes. When they were arrested it
developed that they had come from another neighborhood. Following the
stirring up and organization of anti-Negro sentiment in Hyde Park, an attempt
was made to organize white Woodlawn property owners against the "invasion"
of the district by Negroes. This organization was not a very great success.
There have been no bombings in this district, and no concerted opposition to
the presence of Negroes as neighbors. Long, amicable residence together
and the good character of the Negroes as well as the whites are probably
important reasons for the absence of friction. And it also should be said
that in the Woodlawn district the proportion of Negroes is so small that
there has been no occasion for much controversy over an alleged depreciation
of property values on account of Negro occupancy.
</p>

<p>
<i>The West Side.</i>â€”On the West Side there has been a settlement of Negroes for
many years. Houses are cheaper there than on the South Side; and although
the general level of ordinary workingmen's homes compares favorably with
that on the South Side, there are few abandoned residences formerly occupied
by wealthy persons now available for Negroes. There has been little friction
within this area, in which 9,221 whites and 6,520 Negroes live. West Side
Negroes, laborers for the most part, are generally home-loving, hard-working
people, desirous of improving conditions for their children. Older settlers
among them have been able to make their adjustments without great difficulty,
meeting with no serious antagonism from white neighbors.
</p>

<p>
<i>The North Side.</i>â€”On the North Side, Negroes live among foreign whites
and near a residential area of wealthy Chicagoans. The appearance of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_607' name='Page_607' href='#Page_607'>607</a></span>
first Negro residents there occasioned little notice or objection. They were
for the most part house servants living near their work.
</p>

<p>
This neighborhood has experienced several complete changes in population.
It was first occupied by Irish, then by Swedes, then by Italians, who are the
present neighbors of Negroes. Friendly relations exist between the Sicilians,
who predominate, and their Negro neighbors. Some Negroes live harmoniously
in the same tenements with Sicilians. Their children play together,
and some of the Negro children have learned Sicilian phrases so that they
are able to deal with the Sicilian shopkeepers. Elsewhere on the North Side
the feeling between Italians and Negroes is not so cordial.
</p>

<p>
<i>Non-adjusted neighborhoods.</i>â€”In other sections the failure of Negro and
white neighbors to adjust themselves mutually has produced the most serious
phases of the Negro housing problem. A general housing shortage may be
relieved by the opening of new neighborhoods or the availability of houses
in various parts of the city, but for Negroes there is less opportunity for thus
relieving the housing shortage because of the hostility of many white neighborhoods
to the presence of Negroes.
</p>

<p>
White residents immediately south of the old West Side Negro residence
area objected to the moving in of Negroes, sending numerous threatening letters
to the newcomers and otherwise annoying them. In certain sections of the
North Side, Negro residents have been molested. On one occasion shots
were fired at their homes, and at other times warning signs with pictures of
skulls, crossbones, and coffins were posted. In the Lake Park Avenue area
on the South Side, Negroes are limited to a few blocks, are not permitted to
buy, and are discriminated against in practically all restaurants and amusement
places.
</p>

<p>
West of Wentworth Avenue, adjoining the South Side Negro residence
area, few Negroes live. The residents here are largely Irish working people
and distinctly hostile to Negroes, even to those merely passing through the
neighborhood. This area has many organized gangs and "athletic clubs,"
and its racial antagonisms appear to be traditional.
</p>

<p>
In Park Manor and Wakeford, between Sixty-ninth and Seventy-ninth
streets, Cottage Grove and Indiana avenues, excitement was created in a new
white settlement by an advertisement in a local paper addressed to Negroes
offering them houses there. The name of a white real estate dealer living there
was given. A demonstration followed, meetings were held, and the real
estate man was asked to explain. He asserted, and it seems to have been the
case, that the advertisement was the "spite work" of an enemy.
</p>

<p>
Kenwood and Hyde Park: The neighborhood between Thirty-ninth and
Fifty-ninth streets, State Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, just south of
the Negro residence area, has been termed a "contested neighborhood,"
because of the recent influx of Negroes. The "Black Belt" was already
overcrowded, and its occupants were seeking relief from deteriorated and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_608' name='Page_608' href='#Page_608'>608</a></span>
insufficient housing. The coming of thousands of Negroes from the South
made it overflow. With Lake Michigan flanking the east, encroaching
industry the north, and overcrowded, hostile neighborhoods the west, the
overflow inevitably went south into the west portion of Hyde Park and
Kenwood. Scattered through the South Side were numerous houses and
apartments that had been vacant for many years; and sales were gladly
made to the Negroes, many of the recent southern migrants having considerable
funds. In 1919, of the 3,300 owners of property in the region embracing
parts of Kenwood and Hyde Park and adjacent territory, 1,000 were Negroes.
Already a popular agitation against the Negroes had been begun by real estate
men who formed the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association.
They increased and organized the prejudice against the Negroes in a campaign
"to make Hyde Park white." They held meetings, published a weekly
newspaper, and called upon property owners and other real estate dealers to
pledge themselves against renting or selling to Negroes. In carrying out their
program, they resorted to vilification, ridicule, and disparagement of Negroes,
accusing them of destroying property values and robbing white people of their
homes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Outlying neighborhoods.</i>â€”Few outlying places welcome Negroes as residents.
Morgan Park, however, has offered homes for Negroes, and the
Negro population there has increased from 126 in 1910 to 695 in 1920. They
live for the most part on one side of the town near their own churches; they
own their homes and keep them attractive. School accommodations are poor,
many children leaving school early for that reason.
</p>

<p>
Robbins, another suburb, is entirely Negro, having a Negro mayor. The
town is difficult to reach, unattractive, and uninviting. About 400 hard-working
Negroes occupying seventy houses are trying to develop a town against
the handicaps of lack of capital, swampy lands, and inaccessibility.
</p>

<p>
<i>Depreciation of property.</i>â€”One of the strongest influences in creating and
fostering race antagonism in Chicago is the general belief among whites that
the presence of Negroes in a neighborhood inevitably and alone depreciates
the market value of real estate, and this belief is commonly accepted as a
valid reason for unfriendliness toward Negroes as individuals and as a race.
Therefore the Commission felt that it was important to learn what basis there
is for this belief.
</p>

<p>
The principal influence of Negroes upon property values in a neighborhood
is psychological, due to the deep-seated and general prejudice of whites against
Negroes, which begets and sustains the belief that Negroes destroy property
values wherever they go. The facts as ascertained by the Commission
show that Negro occupancy in a neighborhood is more often due to a prior
depreciation of the property there than the depreciation is due to Negro
occupancy; and that it is unfair to place the entire responsibility for loss of
property values in a neighborhood upon Negro occupancy. In other sections
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_609' name='Page_609' href='#Page_609'>609</a></span>
of the city, where there are no Negroes, depreciation of property values has
been produced by contacts between populations differing in race, religion, or
social standards. Race prejudice produces the present conditions of social
injustice toward the Negro, and uses the depreciation of property which it
causes, as a new ground for such racial prejudice.
</p>

<p>
In virtually every neighborhood in Chicago where Negroes now live they
were preceded by two or more distinct groups of occupants, and an earlier
and often long-continued depreciation of property values is one of the explanations
of their presence. This depreciation of values has come from several
causes, such as natural physical deterioration, vacation of old and large houses
through the death of their original occupants or their removal to new neighborhoods,
or the encroachments of vice, or business, or factories, and the like.
In this way Negroes have found an opportunity to rent or buy at figures that
were comparatively low and within their limited means.
</p>

<p>
The extension of Negro occupancy into the district between State Street
and Lake Michigan and Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth streets followed such an
earlier depreciation; and later, similar conditions had similar consequences
in the district between State Street and Cottage Grove Avenue and Thirty-ninth
and Sixty-third streets, where there has been the most active opposition
to the Negro influx.
</p>

<p>
In the first named of these two districts there are now about 20 per cent
more Negroes than whites. During the eighties and nineties this area
embraced the most fashionable residence district in Chicago, and almost the
entire Negro population lived in the adjoining area on the westâ€”from State
Street to Wentworth Avenue and north of Thirty-fifth Street. When the
fashionable people of this district began to move to the North Side, the deserted
section began to depreciate, and costly houses recently occupied by wealthy
owners were thrown upon the market and began to pass through the hands of
real estate dealers and into the possession of people belonging to a different
social class. Physical deterioration also played its part. Between 1900 and
1910, when the first Negroes moved into Wabash Avenueâ€”one street nearer
to the old fashionable districtâ€”the houses were at least twenty years old and
many of them much older. Real estate men estimate the natural depreciation
of such buildings at from 2 to 2Â½ per cent per year; so that in many cases
property once exclusive and of a high class had depreciated at least 50 per cent
before there was any prospect of Negro occupancy.
</p>

<p>
In 1912 the old vice area west of State Street and northwest of this exclusive
area was broken up. The inmates, numbering at that time more than 2,000,
moved into the nearest large houses available where they could ply their
trade clandestinely. They could afford high rents, and owners and agents
profited accordingly. Cabarets, cafÃ©s, and saloons sought the side streets,
and buffet flats were opened. Raids and prosecutions called attention to the
changed character of the neighborhood, and property values sank still lower.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_610' name='Page_610' href='#Page_610'>610</a></span>
Many buildings affected by this decline were bought up by real estate speculators
and sold to Negroes who were eager for housing. One speculator
bought more than 1,400 such houses.
</p>

<p>
Then came the automobile industries with their showrooms, gas stations,
manufacturing plants, and accessory shops, even invading the boulevards,
and the desirability of adjacent residence property still further declined.
</p>

<p>
After the coming of the Negroes the depreciation continued. It was clear
that the character of the neighborhood had definitely changed. Negroes were
frequently unable to make the needed extensive repairs while they were paying
for their property. There are other instances in this area where property not
owned by Negroes declined in value chiefly because of its neglect by landlords.
</p>

<p>
In the district west of Cottage Grove Avenue, adjacent to Hyde Park
proper, depreciation had proceeded in much the same manner. This neighborhood
was temporarily congested in the period of the World's Columbian Exposition
in 1893, and hotels and apartment houses were built far in excess of normal
needs. Real estate men of that district have made much of this point, stating
that many of the houses there had been vacant as long as fifteen years. The
first "undesirables" were not Negroes, but other national or racial groups of
whites who were objectionable to the original residents. Several factors
have combined to make this section less and less desirable for residence
purposes. It is close to the Stock Yards, with their offensive odors; and
railroads flank it on both sides, with their smoke and noise. The coming of
the automobile industries, the opening of boarding-houses, the southward
movement of the vice element, all had their adverse effect on property values
before Negroes moved east of State Street.
</p>

<p>
The widespread and deep-seated racial prejudice among whites against
Negroes, heretofore mentioned as a psychological basis for the belief that the
presence of Negroes is disastrous to property values, is directly reflected in
the unwillingness of whites to buy property close to that occupied by Negroes
and in their desire to sell, even at a sacrifice, when Negroes move into
the immediate neighborhood. While frequently the demand for property
among Negroes financially able to buy has not been large enough to absorb
realty offered for sale because of the reasons given here, there are, on the
other hand, some neighborhoods where the Negro demand has provided a
market for property that had long been unmarketable, and in these neighborhoods
there has been some increase in the value of such property. It should
be noted that the understandable bitterness of feeling on this question of
Negro entrance into white residence districts has been intensified in some
cases through exploitation, by both white and Negro real estate operators,
of anti-Negro prejudice and fear of loss on account of Negro occupancy.
</p>

<p>
In brief, Negro occupancy depreciates the value of residence property in
Chicago because of the social prejudice of white people against Negroes, and
because white people will not, and Negroes are financially unable to buy at fair
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_611' name='Page_611' href='#Page_611'>611</a></span>
market prices property thrown upon the market when a neighborhood begins
to change from white to Negro occupancy; nevertheless, a large part of the
depreciation of residence property often charged to Negro occupancy comes
from entirely different causes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Financial aspects of Negro housing.</i>â€”One difficulty of Negroes in handling
their own housing problem is the attitude of real estate mortgage and loan
concerns with respect to property tenanted or likely to be tenanted by Negroes.
Such property is assumed to be a bad risk, and, as a consequence, Negroes
are charged more than whites and find it difficult to secure mortgages to
assist in purchasing and are greatly handicapped in their efforts to improve
property. This situation has its basis in various beliefs concerning Negroes
that are often unwarranted. It developed from the inquiries of the Commission
that mortgage brokers were influenced to a large degree by opinions of
prospective buyers of Negro mortgages, and these prospective buyers in turn
were influenced by beliefs for which there was little basis. It was assumed,
for example, that Negroes were unreliable in business dealings. Conferences
were held by the Commission with the real estate men who handled the
greatest portion of Negro property, and many other real estate men were
interviewed by the Commission's investigators. Their testimony indicated a
buying capacity far beyond what was expected and showed that Negroes had
a good record for meeting their obligations. One real estate man who has
made a large number of sales to Negroes, stated that in the whole of his
experience there had been but two forfeitures, and neither of these was due to
negligence or carelessness. An increasing tendency to buy was noted. This
was easily explained by other facts gathered by the Commission which indicated
that it was easier for Negroes to buy than to rent property, that during
the period of the migration hundreds of dwellings were offered for sale to
Negroes on long-term payment plans, and that many migrants who had sold
their homes, farms, and belongings in the South came to the city prepared to
make substantial payments on property. Many Negroes now own houses
valued at from $10,000 to $20,000, and in one instance $30,000.
</p>

<p>
Regarding Negro habits of saving, inquiries were made at all the principal
banks of the city's business section and of the neighborhood where Negroes
live. Those who were able to check up on Negro depositors reported large
sums deposited and invested. One trust and savings bank had Negro deposits
of $1,500,000 and another of $1,000,000; one state bank had $650,000 and
another $150,000. A large banking institution in the "Loop" district had
4,000 Negro depositors.
</p>

<p>
Opportunities for using their own capital to relieve their housing problems
were limited by lack of opportunities for obtaining business experience. All
the concerns questioned regarding the practicability of employing Negroes in
such institutions were of the opinion that it would not meet with the favor of
the other employees and patrons.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_612' name='Page_612' href='#Page_612'>612</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Bombings.</i>â€”The antagonistic sentiment attributable to the Negro housing
situation both incited and condoned the fifty-eight bombings of homes committed
between July 1, 1917, and March 1, 1921. In these bombings two
persons, a Negro girl and an infant, were killed, many whites and Negroes
were injured, and damage done to property amounted to more than $100,000.
Negroes who purchased or rented property and whites who sold or leased it
were bombed. Thirty-two bombs were exploded within the area bounded by
Forty-first and Sixtieth streets, Cottage Grove Avenue and State Street.
Although Negroes in some cases were warned of the exact dates on which they
were to be bombed, and policemen were sometimes on duty at the places
where bombs were exploded, only two arrests were made. One of those
arrested was immediately released and the other was never brought to trial.
Protests to the authorities from Negroes have been without effect, and a strong
feeling of insecurity and resentment has developed among them. It appears
from evidence presented to the Commission that bombings have been systematically
planned. Many white residents, objecting to the violence suggested
and used to keep out Negroes, withdrew from the neighborhood protective
organizations, fearing that they might be held responsible for the resulting
lawlessness.
</p>

<p>
These protective associations have denied responsibility and declared
that they used only legitimate methods, such as foreclosure of mortgages and
refusal to deal with Negroes. During the summer of 1920, they stated, sixty-eight
foreclosures were effected.
</p>

<h4>
3. THE NEGRO COMMUNITY
</h4>

<p>
The Negro community in Chicago is virtually a city within a city. It
affords opportunity to observe how it is accomplishing its own adjustment
to the larger community, and how it attempts to function in its own behalf
and for the betterment of the community at large.
</p>

<p>
Negroes have lived in Chicago since its founding. In fact, the first settler,
in 1778, was a Negro, Jean Baptiste Point de Saible. There were Negro
property owners at the time of the city's incorporation in 1837. Before the
Chicago fire in 1871 they lived near what is now the "Loop" business district,
north of Harrison Street on Clark and Dearborn streets and on Lake Street
on the West Side. Their homes were burned in 1873, and after that they
settled in the territory adjoining what later became the "red light" district
near Roosevelt Road.
</p>

<p>
<i>Organization of the Negro community.</i>â€”Partly from necessity and partly
from choice, Negroes have established their own churches, business enterprises,
amusement places, social agencies, and newspapers. The number of their
business places increased from about 1,200 in 1919 to about 1,500 in 1920.
There are 651 places of business operated by Negroes on South State Street,
and 549 on the principal cross streets. The majority of these places are those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_613' name='Page_613' href='#Page_613'>613</a></span>
rendering personal serviceâ€”barber shops, restaurants, hair-dressing parlors,
and undertaking establishments. There are also two banks.
</p>

<p>
Organizations for social intercourse are numerous, consisting principally
of churches, fraternal societies, and social clubs. There are 170 congregations
holding services in church edifices and in "store-front" churches. Olivet
Baptist Church has more than 10,000 members, the largest Negro church
membership in the world. It employs sixteen paid workers, and during the
last five years has raised more than $200,000. These churches are the principal
center for "face-to-face" relations and aid greatly in the process of adjusting
Negroes to civic responsibilities. Forty-nine of these congregations own
property valued at fully a million and a half dollars.
</p>

<p>
The social and civic agencies are expressions of the group effort to adjust
itself to the community. There are in the Negro community distinct organizations
of this kind designed especially for Negroes, and branches of general
agencies located conveniently for use by Negroes. Of the former type the
Chicago Urban League is the most notable example. This organization is
a clearing-house for social work among Negroes, and its activities include
social investigations, an industrial bureau, and child welfare. It has an
executive board and officers composed of both whites and Negroes, and a
highly efficient staff of Negro workers. During 1920 more than 25,000
Negroes were assisted through this organization. Provident Hospital is
another example of this type.
</p>

<p>
Of the latter type the Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A. is an example. It is a
branch of the city Y.M.C.A., and has adjusted itself to the peculiar social
problems of its membership and community. Other agencies are the Community
Service, Wendell Phillips Settlement on the West Side, Butler Community
Center on the North Side, Phyllis Wheatley Home for Girls, Home
for the Aged and Infirm, Indiana Avenue Y.W.C.A., Elaine Home Club,
Julia Johnson Home for Girls, Hartzell Center, and Illinois Technical School
for Colored Girls (a Roman Catholic institution).
</p>

<p>
Of the general social agencies with branches convenient for Negroes are
the American Red Cross, United Charities, Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium,
Abraham Lincoln Center. Although some of these branches are poorly
supported and undermanned, they represent efforts of the community to care
for itself. During 1920 six social agencies and twenty-seven churches raised
among Negroes $445,000 for social-welfare work.
</p>

<h3>
IV. <span class="smcap">Racial Contacts</span>
</h3>

<p>
The problems arising out of various occasions, both voluntary and enforced,
for race association in Chicago, have, for convenience, been included in this
report under the general classification of "racial contacts." Attention is
given to contacts in the public schools, in public recreation places, on transportation
lines, and in other relations exclusive of industry and housing which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_614' name='Page_614' href='#Page_614'>614</a></span>
require special treatment. Negroes in Illinois are legally entitled to all the
rights and privileges of other citizens. Actually, however, their participation
in public benefits in practically every field is limited by some circumvention
of the law.
</p>

<h4>
1. <a name="Contacts" id="Contacts">CONTACTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS</a>
</h4>

<p>
The public schools furnish one of the most important points of contact
between the white and Negro races because of the daily association of thousands
of Negro and white children at an impressionable age. The Chicago Board
of Education makes no distinction between the races and keeps no separate
records. Certain schools, therefore, with white American, Negro, and white
foreign-born preponderances, were selected for special study.
</p>

<p>
<i>Physical equipment of schools.</i>â€”Twenty-two schools located in and near
areas of Negro residence were selected and visited. Of these only five, or
23 per cent, have been built since 1900, and four of these five schools are in
regions where the Negro population is smallest. The ten schools serving the
largest percentage of Negroes were built, one in 1856, one in 1867, seven between
1880 and 1889, and only one after 1890. Of the 235 schools attended almost
wholly by whites, 133, or 56 per cent, were built after 1899. The old buildings
will not accommodate modern equipment and cannot be enlarged. The
absence of modern buildings is in part due to the old residence areas in which
Negroes must live. The gymnasiums in fifteen of these twenty-two schools
of predominant Negro attendance are poorly equipped, and in the other
seven schools there are none. Playground space is about the same in all the
schools, and there was no exceptional overcrowding in schools attended largely
by Negroes except in one case where by the "shift" system a double attendance
was made possible. In the schools of mixed attendance one instance was
conspicuous: Fuller Schoolâ€”a branch of Felsenthal which is well equipped,
and under the same principal, who is an advocate of segregationâ€”is in a
neighborhood where the percentage of Negroes is the same as that around
Felsenthal, but it has no playground, is run down, and neglected. Yet it has 90
per cent Negroes, while Felsenthal has 38 per cent. Unmanageable white
children are sent to Fuller.
</p>

<p>
<i>Retardation.</i>â€”The question of retardation<a name='FA_106' id='FA_106' href='#FN_106' class='fnanchor'>[106]</a> of Negro children is of serious
concern in race relations, since this fact is urged by advocates of separate
schools as an unnecessary handicap for white children and a reason for segregation.
Twenty-four schools were selected, with the aid of the Board of
Education: six attended mainly by Negroes, six mainly by white Americans,
and twelve mainly by children of immigrants. Of a total of 34,593 children
there were 18,230, or 53 per cent, retardedâ€”the same percentage as in the
entire city; 10,250, or 30 per cent, normal; and 5,910, or 17 per cent, accelerated.
In the schools attended mainly by white Americans, 49 per cent were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_615' name='Page_615' href='#Page_615'>615</a></span>
retarded; in those attended mainly by children of immigrants 49 per cent;
and in those attended mainly by Negroes 74 per cent. The percentage of
retardation in schools attended mainly by Negroes ranges from 57 to 80
per cent; in schools attended mainly by children of immigrants from 32 to 71
per cent; and in schools attended mainly by white Americans from 40 to
62 per cent.
</p>

<p>
Predominating causes of this retardation of Negro children, according to
the Board of Education's classification, are: "late entrance to school,"
"family difficulties," "fathers or mothers working," "lack of education in
parents." The majority of retarded Negro children are southerners, and
their retardation can be readily understood when the gross inadequacies of
southern schools for Negroes are considered.
</p>

<p>
Among the whites, late entrance, inability to speak English, ill health,
backwardness, and low mentality are the various causes. It is interesting to
note that while it is often maintained that Negroes are mentally weak and
incapable, classification of retardation figures according to causes does not
bear out that theory. Negro children retarded from "late entrance" have
made excellent records in attaining a normal rating, some completing three
grades in a year.
</p>

<p>
One hundred and sixteen Negro children were picked at random for an
intensive inquiry by the Commission into causes of retardation. Of these, 101
had been in school before coming to Chicago; and of the 101 children, eighty
had lived in the South and had gone to southern schools; those born and
educated in the North showed no greater rate of retardation than the whites.
For much of the retardation the school facilities for Negroes in the South
appear to be responsible. In Mississippi, for example, only eighty days'
schooling is required in counties that do not absolutely reject the compulsory-education
law. Other causes found were inadequate care and instruction at
home due to the ignorance of parents, mothers working out, poor parental
discipline, and the physical condition of homes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Contact problems.</i>â€”A wide variety of opinions was found among principals
and teachers concerning the relations of white and Negro children. Several
principals were distinctly antagonistic to Negroes, and in their schools the
race relations of the pupils were not cordial. The most important factor in
determining the attitude of teachers as well as of pupils was the attitude of
principals. Kindergarten teachers found a natural, pleasant relationship
existing between the young white and Negro children. As children grew
older they became more race conscious, and in the high schools friction frequently
arose from race groupings in class and social organizations. Negro
teachers are assigned to schools attended by both Negroes and immigrants,
and apparently have no difficulties with pupils or parents. Difficulties and
bad feeling have been provoked by the disposition of certain white teachers
to adapt their instruction in accordance with their assumptions concerning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_616' name='Page_616' href='#Page_616'>616</a></span>
Negroes' mental and emotional characteristics, putting stress on singing and
handicraft instead of on basic studies in arithmetic and grammar.
</p>

<h4>
2. RECREATION
</h4>

<p>
In its investigation of recreation places, the Commission listed 127 parks,
playgrounds, recreation centers, and beaches under the supervision of the
Municipal Bureau of Parks, Playgrounds, and Bathing Beaches, and of the
South Park, West Park, and Lincoln Park commissions. Of these, thirty-seven
are in or near Negro areas. Though this figure represents a fairly adequate
distribution, it is not an accurate picture. Twenty-three of these places are
playgrounds attached to schools, fourteen being in, and nine near, Negro
areas; and only thirteen have more than 10 per cent use by Negroes. Three
bathing-beaches are within, and two near, Negro areas, while only one has
more than 10 per cent use by Negroes. There are seven recreation centers
near Negro areas, none within, and only one with more than 10 per cent use
by Negroes. Armour Square, for example, is a recreation center bordering
on the area of the largest Negro population; but the hostility of whites,
especially gangs of hoodlums, attacks on Negro children, and the indifferent
attitude of the director render attendance by Negroes extremely hazardous.
Of a daily attendance of 1,500, less than 1 per cent are Negroes, despite the
fact that over 50 per cent of the immediately surrounding population is Negro.
Natural barriers of distance, unofficial discrimination of officials, and the
hostility of neighborhood groups are largely responsible for the lack of participation.
</p>

<p>
The beaches have presented the most difficult problems of race control.
The riot of 1919 began at the Twenty-ninth Street Beach, and since the riot
numerous smaller clashes have occurred there. At Thirty-eighth Street,
also on the edge of the largest area of Negro residence, Negroes are entirely
excluded, the policeman on duty and the attendant in charge assisting in this
exclusion to prevent clashes. In neighborhoods with a small Negro population,
attendance at the recreation places is always much below the percentage
of Negroes to the total population in such neighborhoods, this being due to
the hostility shown by whites, especially of the hoodlum element, and also
to the reluctance of Negroes to go where they feel unwelcome.
</p>

<p>
<i>Contacts.</i>â€”Most difficulties in parks and playgrounds have not been
caused by the behavior of Negroes there. Such complaints against Negroes
as have come from these contacts have concerned groups of rough or domineering
children at the playgrounds rather than adults. Two playgrounds on
the South Side make such complaints.
</p>

<p>
<i>Race relations of the children.</i>â€”Lack of racial antagonism was reported at
a large number of playgrounds. Apparatus was used by both groups without
friction. Negro and white children mingled freely in their games and in the
swimming-pools, and both Negroes and whites played on baseball and athletic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_617' name='Page_617' href='#Page_617'>617</a></span>
teams. The occasional playground fights usually lack any element of racial
antipathy. "There might be personal misunderstandings and disagreements
between a white and a black just the same as between two whites," said the
director of Union Park, "but I wouldn't lay it to race prejudice. They
work together and play together and seem to harmonize in most instances."
When this director came to Union Park a year ago he found a tendency among
Negroes and whites to separate into race groups, but steps were taken to bring
them together in games of various kinds, and toward the end of the season the
director felt that they "harmonized better and worked together more cordially
than they did before." When the Commission's investigator visited Union
Park Playground he saw small children of both races playing together on the
same pieces of apparatusâ€”a Negro child on one end of a teeter ladder and a
white child on the other. Occasionally there is a disturbance, usually starting
from a dispute over the apparatus; but on the whole the children play together
peacefully.
</p>

<p>
<i>Voluntary racial grouping.</i>â€”Voluntary racial grouping appears to be
more characteristic of the large parks and beaches which adults frequent
than of the playgrounds, which are used mainly by children. One instance
of voluntary grouping among children was found at Copernicus Playground.
The playing space is in the shape of an "L," one end intended for boys and the
other for girls, but by common consent the children divide along race lines
rather than sex.
</p>

<p>
In the general use of Lincoln and Washington parks the Negroes and whites
stay in separate groups. There has never been any difficulty, according to
the Lincoln Park representative, arising from the fact that Negroes have
taken possession of a spot desired by whites for a picnic or other amusement.
No part of either park is especially set aside for the use of one race, and groups
of both Negroes and whites are seen everywhere in the parks, but they do not
mingle.
</p>

<p>
Some directors attempt to regulate these contacts to avoid any mingling
of groups. At the Municipal Pier, for example, an investigator learned that
when Negro couples went on the dancing-pavilion floor the floor manager
informed them that they were not dancing properly and took them to one
side to acquaint them with the approved style of dancing; no matter how
well they danced, they were to be prevented from going on the floor by
the manager's judgment of their dancing. More recently, however, Negroes
have reported that they have been able freely to use this dance floor.
</p>

<p>
Clashes in the various recreation places as early as 1913 were found to
have been started mostly by gangs of white "roughs." On one occasion, for
example, the secretary of boys' work of the Wabash Avenue department
Y.M.C.A. (for Negroes) conducted a party of nineteen Negro boys to Armour
Square. They had no difficulty in entering the park, but on leaving they
were assailed by crowds of white boys. Some of them were tripped, trodden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_618' name='Page_618' href='#Page_618'>618</a></span>
upon, and badly bruised. They took refuge in a neighboring saloon, where
they remained for a half-hour, when a detachment of police scattered the white
gang. On another occasion a group of boys from the same institution were
driven from the lake at Thirty-first Street. In 1915 Father Bishop, of St.
Thomas Episcopal Church, took a group of Negro boys to Armour Square
to play basket-ball. The entire party, including Father Bishop, were beaten
by white boys and their sweaters taken from them. In the same year an
attempt was made by a Negro boys' club director to take seventy-five Negro
boys through the Stock Yards. They had received tickets of admission to
the stock show. In spite of the presence and efforts of four adult leaders,
these boys were struck by sticks and other missiles while passing from one
section of the show to another. Police assistance was required to get them
from the pavilion to the street cars.
</p>

<p>
Gangs of white boys, sixteen and seventeen years of age, from the neighborhood
of Fifty-ninth Street and Wentworth Avenue frequently interfered with
Negro participants in baseball games in Washington Park, especially during
the spring and summer of 1918 and 1919. They also annoyed Negro couples
on the park benches. Where the Negro showed fight, minor clashes resulted.
Park officials have not been able to restrain the ill feeling which these conflicts
engender.
</p>

<p>
Clashes were noted in Ogden Park as early as 1914 and frequently
since that time. A Negro playground director testified that he and other
Negroes had been slugged while attending band concerts or attempting to
use shower baths after a game in the park. At the boathouse in Washington
Park, in the early summer of 1920, there were numerous clashes between
Negroes and whites. In the following year, however, considerably fewer
instances of friction were reported. Playground directors are of the opinion
that friction is likely to occur where groups of Negro children for the first time
come into parks theretofore exclusively used by whites. Adjustment is likely
to follow after this period. In some cases, however, when the proportion of
Negroes has grown larger than that of whites, a Negro director has been placed
in charge of the park with the unofficial understanding that it should be turned
over to Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The two causes of neighborhood antagonism back of the friction in the
parks most commonly cited are the housing and sex problems. The playgrounds
and parks usually share in a general way the sentiments of the mixed
neighborhoods in or near which they are located.
</p>

<p>
One source of racial disorders is lack of co-operation between park and
city policemen. The park police stop a fight between white and colored
children and send them out of the park. When the fight is renewed outside
the park they have no power to interfere. Spectators may then get into the
fight, and serious clashes may be well under way before the city police can be
summoned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_619' name='Page_619' href='#Page_619'>619</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The most important remedies suggested to the Commission for the betterment
of relations between Negroes and whites at the various places of recreation
were: (1) additional facilities in Negro areas, particularly recreation
centers which can be used by adults; (2) an awakened public opinion which
will refuse to tolerate the hoodlum and will insist that the courts properly
punish such offenders; (3) selection of directors for parks in neighborhoods
where there is a critical situation who have a sympathetic understanding of
the problem and will not tolerate actions by park police officers and other
subordinate officials which tend to discourage Negro attendance; and (4)
efforts by such directors to repress and remove any racial antagonism that
may arise in the neighborhood about the park.
</p>

<h4>
3. CONTACTS IN TRANSPORTATION
</h4>

<p>
The study of contacts between whites and Negroes in street cars and
other public conveyances was prompted by a usually unexplained emphasis
on apparently trivial incidents connected with public conveyances, together
with the observation that the greatest disturbances during the riot of 1919
commonly occurred along transportation lines and at transfer points.
</p>

<p>
Although many clashes and other instances of racial friction on the street
cars were not serious enough to be reported to the newspapers or to be
made the subject of complaint, information obtained by investigators for the
Commission showed that the attitude of both Negroes and whites toward
each other was being affected by contacts on the cars.
</p>

<p>
As affecting attitudes on race relations, transportation contacts, while
impersonal and temporary, are significant for several reasons. Many whites
have no contact with Negroes except on the cars, and their personal impression
of the entire Negro group may be determined by one or two observations of
Negro passengers. Unlike contacts in the school, playground, and workshop,
transportation contacts are not supervised, and if there is any dispute among
passengers the settlement usually rests with themselves. Suspicion or prejudice
on either side because of the difference in race accentuates any misunderstanding.
And transportation contacts, at least on crowded cars,
involve physical contact between Negroes and whites, which rarely occurs
under other circumstances and sometimes leads to a display of racial
feeling.
</p>

<p>
The Commission's investigators, white and Negro, men and women,
made many trips for observation on the twelve lines carrying the heaviest
volume of Negro traffic and therefore involving the greatest amount of contact.
Counts of passengers, Negro and white, were made, behavior and habits were
noted, and passengers and car crews were drawn into conversation. Officials
of surface and elevated lines, starters, and station men were interviewed. Instances
of friction which came to the attention of the Commission were noted
and the circumstances studied.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_620' name='Page_620' href='#Page_620'>620</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Traffic counts made by the Chicago Traction and Subway Commission
in 1916 showed 3,500,000 surface-railway and 500,000 elevated-railway
passengers carried in a twenty-four-hour day. Negroes constitute 4 per cent
of the city's population and probably about that percentage of the city's
street-car traffic. Negro traffic, however, instead of being scattered over the
city, is mainly concentrated upon twelve lines which traverse the Negro
residential areas and connect those areas with the manufacturing districts
where Negroes are employed. Because of this concentration the proportion
of Negroes to whites on these twelve lines is much higher than 4 per cent,
and on such lines as that on State Street, the principal business street of the
South Side Negro residence area, it often happens that the majority of the
passengers are Negroes.
</p>

<p>
There is no "Jim Crow" separation of races on street cars in Chicago.
Contacts of Negroes and whites on the street cars did not provoke any considerable
discussion before the period of migration of Negroes from the South,
when occasional stories of clashes began to be circulated; and even then,
such friction as developed did not come prominently to public attention.
Only one incident involving a clash was reported in the newspapers. Even
since the migration began, there have been very few complaints based upon
racial friction. The Elevated Railroad Company, whose South Side line has
the largest Negro traffic of any elevated line, replied to inquiries that, except
during the riot of 1919, when a few cases of racial disorder were reported,
there had been no complaints from motormen or trainmen since 1918, when a
trainman was cut by a Negro. No complaints from white passengers had
been received since the spring of 1917, when white office workers objected to
riding with Stock Yards laborers, mainly Negroes, on the Stock Yards spur of
the elevated. White laborers in the Stock Yards mostly live within walking
distance of their work, but Negroes found it necessary to use car lines running
east to the main area of Negro residence. The Chicago Surface lines replied
that complaints due to racial friction were negligible.
</p>

<p>
Many of the migrants are laborers who must use these lines going to and
from work, and many of them are rough-mannered and entirely unfamiliar
with standards of conduct in northern cities. Another serious factor is the
recent entrance of Negroes into industry. Before the war the great majority of
Negroes gainfully employed were engaged in some form of personal service
which did not require use of transportation lines in their working clothes to
and from the manufacturing centers. The migrants, many of them coming
to a city like Chicago with no "Jim Crow" segregation, felt strange and
uncertain as to how they should act. In fact, peculiarities of conduct on the
part of these were noted by Negroes of longer residence in Chicago, and it has
been remarked by whites and Negroes that they could tell a Negro migrant by
his uneasy manner and often by his clothing. Conspicuous points of behavior
of migrant Negroes before they became urbanized, which many whites noted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_621' name='Page_621' href='#Page_621'>621</a></span>
and commented on were: "loud laughter and talking," "old and ill-smelling
clothes," "roughness and his tendency to sit all over the car." These are
easy to understand when one considers the background of the southern Negro.
There are, on the other hand, exceptional cases where Negroes have walked
miles rather than take a car, thus avoiding possible embarrassment. A Negro
who has been in Chicago for a long time is not self-conscious about sitting
near white persons. Negroes who get into trouble with whites about insisting
on their right to a seat often belong to the class of suspicious and sensitive
Negroes who fear that an attempt is being made to segregate them, and
sometimes they are simply "greenhorns."
</p>

<p>
Soiled and ill-smelling clothing was found to be an objection applying to
white as well as Negro laborers. These complaints came, for the most part,
from clerical workers who objected to physical contact with persons who might
"rub off." A difficulty involving this feature was adjusted by one packing
company by dismissing its clerical workers and its laborers at different hours.
A frequent source of misunderstanding has been a situation in which it appeared
that Negroes had taken seats intended for white women. In several
such cases thoroughly examined by the Commission's investigators the difficulties
were found to have resulted from misunderstood actions.
</p>

<p>
Most of the difficulties in transportation contacts reported and generally
complained of seem to have centered around the first blundering efforts of
migrants to adjust themselves to northern city life. The efforts of agencies
interested in assisting this adjustment, together with the Negro press and the
intimate criticisms and suggestions for proper conduct of Chicago Negroes,
have smoothed down many of the roughnesses of the migrants, and as a result
friction from contacts in transportation seems to have lessened materially.
</p>

<h4>
4. CRIME AND VICIOUS ENVIRONMENT
</h4>

<p>
Many students of the race problem look upon public crime records as a
register of the failure of Negroes to adjust themselves to the social fabric. Study
of infractions of law by Negroes, of provocation to lawlessness, and of the history
of their crimes would indeed reveal an interesting background of their present
behavior in relation to whites, if such a study were possible from present
records. The Commission carried its investigations into this field and found
no means of determining how great a proportion of the city's crimes is
committed by Negroes.
</p>

<p>
The prevailing impression that Negroes are by nature more criminal
than whites and more prone to commit sex crimes has restricted their employment,
increased unfair measures of restraint, and blackened the name of the
entire Negro group. Two important facts were apparent from the Commission's
study: (1) the danger inherent in the vicious environment in which
Negroes are forced to live, and (2) the misrepresentative character of the
statistics of Negro crime.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_622' name='Page_622' href='#Page_622'>622</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Environment.</i>â€”The limitations imposed on Negro residential areas have
provided undue cause and occasion for crime. The entire population, good
and bad, is thrown together, exposing children to the sight and temptation
of vice and immorality. Ninety per cent of the Negro population has always
lived near the city's former segregated vice districts, partly because white
sentiment excluded them from other neighborhoods, partly because rents in
the neighborhood of vice were low enough to meet their meager economic
resources, and partly because their weakness made their protests against the
proximity of vice less effective than the protests of whites. When the vice
districts were broken up and the inmates scattered, they entered the better
neighborhoods of Negro residence and clandestinely plied their trade. In fact,
according to the report of the Chicago Vice Commission in 1911, at one time
prostitutes were promised immunity by the police if they confined themselves
to a certain area in which Negroes predominated. The spread of the Negro
population has always been accompanied by the spread of clandestine prostitution.
The Vice Commission's report said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The history of the social evil in Chicago is intimately connected with the colored
population. Invariably the large vice districts have been created within or near the
settlements of colored people. In the past history of the city every time a new vice
district was created downtown or on the South Side, the colored families were in the
district moving in just ahead of the prostitutes. The situation along State Street
from Sixteenth Street south is an illustration.
</p>

<p>
So whenever prostitutes, cadets, and thugs were located among white people
and had to be moved for commercial or other reasons, they were driven to undesirable
parts of the city, the so-called colored residential sections.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Most of the vicious resorts in the "Black Belt" are owned and operated
by whites and are not interfered with by the authorities. Protests from
Negroes have never succeeded in removing them. Opportunities for wholesome
recreation in the Negro districts are limited, and commercial amusements,
though probably no worse than in some other sections of the city, are of a
distinctly inferior type and carelessly supervised. In such an infective
environment it is not unnatural that many criminals should be developed.
</p>

<p>
But the study of crime statistics, aside from showing the unreliability of
records due to careless methods of obtaining and presenting data, revealed that
Negroes suffer gross injustice in the handling of criminal affairs. The general
inaccuracy of criminal statistics is shown by the fact, for example, that the police
reported 1,731 burglaries, or persons arrested for burglary, in 1919, while
the Chicago Crime Commission reported 5,509 burglaries during the first eleven
months of that year. The evidence at hand indicates that Negroes are debited
with practically all their crimes, while others are not. It further appears,
from the records and from the testimony of judges in the juvenile, municipal,
circuit, superior, and criminal courts, of police officials, the state's attorney, and
various experts on crime, probation, and parole, that Negroes are more commonly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_623' name='Page_623' href='#Page_623'>623</a></span>
arrested, subjected to police identification, and convicted than white
offenders; that on similar evidence they are generally held and convicted
on more serious charges, and that they are given longer sentences. This bias,
when reflected in the figures, serves to bolster by false figures the already
existing belief that Negroes are more likely to be criminal than other racial
groups.
</p>

<h3>
V. <span class="smcap">The Negro in Chicago Industries</span>
</h3>

<p>
Out of Chicago's Negro population of approximately 110,000 in 1920,
it is estimated that 70,000 were gainfully employed. The opportunity for
engaging in industry in large numbers came to Negroes following the outbreak
of the world-war. With the enormous demand from the belligerent
countries for American goods, existing establishments were enlarged and new
ones created. As an example of the increased demand for workers, one of
the packing-plants in the Chicago Stock Yards increased its force during the
war from 8,000 to 17,000. Immigration was almost wholly cut off. The
labor shortage became acute after the entrance of the United States into the
war in 1917. The migration of Negroes from the South during that period
was mainly in response to this demand.
</p>

<p>
Prior to the beginning of the war in 1914, Negroes had been virtually
limited to personal and domestic service in almost every city in the North.
In 1910 more than 60 per cent of those gainfully employed were so engaged,
15 per cent in manufacturing, and 3 per cent in clerical occupations. The
Commission's inquiries covered 136 establishments reporting five or more
Negroes. In these were employed 118,098 whites and 21,987 Negroesâ€”12,854
in manufacturing and 9,133 in non-manufacturing industries.
</p>

<h4>
1. INCREASE IN NEGRO LABOR
</h4>

<p>
Between 1915 and 1920 there was a remarkable increase in the number of
Negroes employed in industries which before 1915 had either employed them
in small numbers or not at all. In a total of sixty-two such plants there was
an increase from 1,346 in 1915 to 10,587 in 1920, or more than 1,000 per cent.
Labor shortage, or inability to obtain competent white workers, was the reason
given in practically every instance for the large increase in Negro employees.
</p>

<p>
Frequent complaints have been made that large employers, particularly
the packers, imported Negroes from the South and were thus responsible for
the difficulties that followed. Definite effort was made to determine the facts,
but the Commission found no basis for the statement.
</p>

<h4>
2. CLASSIFICATION OF NEGRO WORKERS
</h4>

<p>
Absence of standards of classification for skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled
work invalidated the Commission's effort to classify Negro workers. In
sixty-six industries with definite divisions in grades of work, it was found that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_624' name='Page_624' href='#Page_624'>624</a></span>
out of 12,529 Negroes employed, 927 were skilled, 267 semi-skilled and 11,335
unskilled workers. In other returns, not capable of full classification, ten
establishments reported 304 Negro molders; there were thirty-one Negro
molders in 1910. Twelve factories reported 382 machine operators; in 1920
the census reports showed only twenty-eight.
</p>

<p>
Wages of Negroes in the branches of employment where they were permitted
to work were generally the same as for white workers. There were
instances, however, of discrimination in placing or keeping Negroes at work on
processes in which they could not earn as much as in processes on which
white men were engaged. Also there were instances of discrimination in piecework,
the foremen invariably giving Negroes only the jobs yielding a low rate.
For common labor the average wage was 45 and 50 cents an hour for an eight-,
nine- and ten-hour day for men; $15 to $20 a week for women, and an average
of $15 a week, with room and board, for domestics were the going wages.
</p>

<h4>
3. EMPLOYERS' EXPERIENCE WITH NEGRO LABOR
</h4>

<p>
Whether or not the Negro will be able to hold the position in industry made
possible for him by the war depends much on employers' attitude toward him as
a worker. Common explanations given before this period as a reason for not
employing Negroes more were that they were lazy, shiftless, irresponsible, and
inefficient. Generalizations of this sort demonstrate their weakness in the fact
that employers were not speaking from their own experiences. To reach a fair
conclusion employers of Negroes in large numbers were interviewed by the
Commission's investigators.
</p>

<p>
Employers drew a distinction between northern and southern Negroes;
they thought that the latter had shortcomings when they first began work,
but that this was due to former habits of work and familiarity with only
simple industrial processes. Many of these southern workers were irregular
at first in reporting for work and frequently drew their wages before pay day,
thus confusing the bookkeeping. They were soon forced, however, to abandon
these habits.
</p>

<p>
One question asked of all employers was: "Has your Negro labor proved
satisfactory?" Of the 137 establishments employing five or more Negro
workers, 118 reported that Negro labor had proved satisfactory; nineteen
reported that Negro labor had not proved satisfactory. The 118 establishments
reporting Negro workers as satisfactory employed 21,640 Negroes,
while the nineteen reporting them as unsatisfactory employed 697. Comparing
the efficiency of Negro and white workers, seventy-one employers interviewed
(thirty-four manufacturers and thirty-seven non-manufacturers) considered
the Negro equally efficient, twenty-two employers (thirteen manufacturers
and nine non-manufacturers) considered the Negro less efficient. The seventy-one
establishments included almost all the large establishments. A few gave the
Negro a higher rating than the foreigners because of his knowledge of English.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_625' name='Page_625' href='#Page_625'>625</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Regarding reliability, ninety-two employers gave opinions. Sixty-three
(thirty manufacturers and thirty-three non-manufacturers) believed that
Negroes did not require more supervision than white workers, while twenty-nine
(sixteen manufacturers and thirteen non-manufacturers) thought they
required more supervision. Of the employers interviewed, fifty-seven expressed
the opinion (twenty-three manufacturers and thirty-four non-manufacturers)
that "absenteeism" among Negro workers was no greater than among whites,
while thirty-six reported it was greater.
</p>

<p>
One plant employing 2,084 Negroes stated that the better living standards
and ambitions had brought up the rating of Negro workers during the war
period.
</p>

<h4>
4. LABOR TURNOVER
</h4>

<p>
Of the thirty-two employers giving figures on relative labor turnover,
twenty-four (eleven manufacturers and thirteen non-manufacturers) reported
the Negro turnover to be the same as the white, and twenty-eight (eighteen
manufacturers and ten non-manufacturers) believed the turnover to be greater.
Closely connected with the labor turnover among Negroes is the question of
"hope on the job," as one Negro expressed it. When Negroes are not allowed
to advance to better positions in a given plant, or are discriminated against by
foremen underrating their efficiency, the turnover in the plant is high.
</p>

<h4>
5. NEGRO WOMEN IN INDUSTRY
</h4>

<p>
Before the war Negro women were even more definitely restricted than
Negro men in choice of occupations. Two-thirds of those gainfully employed
were in two occupation groups: "servants" and laundresses, not in laundries,
and domestic servants. Of the 137 establishments studied, forty-two had no
Negro women employees, forty-five kept no separate records, and fifty reported
a total of 3,407 Negro women workers. Although this study does not include
all industries employing women, the total given represents a large increase
over the figure of 998 Negro women enumerated by the 1910 census as engaged
in all industries in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Many of the establishments in question had employed large numbers
of Negro women as an experiment and had found them satisfactory. One
mail-order house employed as many as 650 girls for clerical work. When the
plant was investigated in 1920, there were 311 girls, 75 per cent of whom were
high-school graduates, while 12 per cent had had two or more years in college.
These employers said the girls felt that they were making history for the race
and were, if anything, a little over-zealous. They were thought to be excitable
and suspicious of the actions of the white girls.
</p>

<p>
Millinery establishments, manufacturers of clothing, lamp-shades, gas-mantles,
paper-boxes, and cheese makers reported satisfactory experience
with Negro women. Of twenty laundries employing Negro workers, satisfactory
or unsatisfactory, four did not keep separate records. Twelve with 409 Negro
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_626' name='Page_626' href='#Page_626'>626</a></span>
women reported their work satisfactory, and four with 134 Negro women
reported it unsatisfactory. The chief complaint was unwillingness to work
overtime or on Sundays. In both instances, however, employees interviewed
complained that the hours were long (nine hours a day) and their treatment
by the management harsh and inconsiderate.
</p>

<p>
Of 865 Negro employees interviewed, less than 1 per cent complained of
disagreeable treatment by white workers and less than 50 per cent complained
of conditions of work. Others expressed themselves as glad of the opportunity
to earn good wages. Complaints against conditions of work were found in
the iron and steel mills, Stock Yards, and dining-car and sleeping-car service.
</p>

<h4>
6. INDUSTRIES EXCLUDING THE NEGRO
</h4>

<p>
Several important industries have not opened their doors to Negroes
except as janitors and porters. Among these are the traction companies,
elevated and surface, the State Street department stores, and the taxicab
companies. Employers in these establishments express the belief that the
public would object to Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Attention has been called to the waste involved in the limitations of
Negroes in industry. Men with college training are forced to work as waiters
and porters, and young-women college graduates are frequently forced to work
as ushers in theaters and as ladies' maids. This condition helps to account
for the ease with which 1,500 Negro girls with more than average schooling
were recruited in less than two months for the mail-order houses.
</p>

<h4>
7. RELATIONS BETWEEN WHITE AND NEGRO WORKERS
</h4>

<p>
Through working together friendliness between white and Negro workers
has been increased, according to prevalent views. Information concerning
relations was secured from all the 137 plants studied. Two reported that
race friction was a disturbing factor in the plants. Minor instances of friction
have occurred, but it appeared that as a rule the workers reflected the attitude
of the management. The setting up of partitions separating the races developed
an antagonistic sentiment, and in some instances this antagonism was
removed when the partitions were taken down. Of 101 establishments visited
eighteen, or 11 per cent, with 2,623 Negroes, maintained separate accommodations.
This constituted a continuous source of dissatisfaction for Negro
workers, who felt themselves "Jim Crowed." In the remaining 89 per cent,
employing 19,714 Negroes among more than 100,000 whites, all accommodations
were used in common by both races.
</p>

<h4>
8. THE PERIOD OF INDUSTRIAL DEPRESSION
</h4>

<p>
Following the war's inflation of industry a slump came in the winter of
1920-21. Common labor was reduced in all the large plants from 20 to 50
per cent. Negroes, mostly common laborers, suffered most from this reduction.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_627' name='Page_627' href='#Page_627'>627</a></span>
At one period there were as many as 15,000 Negroes unemployed in
Chicago. They were cared for during their enforced idleness by the Urban
League and Negro churches and by popular contributions from working
Negroes. The reduction of labor was usually carried out by employers with
some system, and few instances of gross race discrimination were reported.
</p>

<h4>
9. ORGANIZED LABOR AND NEGRO WORKERS
</h4>

<p>
Clashing interests have manifested themselves conspicuously in the relations
between union labor organizations and Negro workers, and this antagonism
has been carried over into the relations of whites and Negroes generally. The
efforts of union labor to promote its cause have built up a body of sentiment
not easy to oppose by workers unsympathetic toward the labor movement.
Circumstances have frequently made Negroes strike breakers, and thus
centered upon them as a racial group all the bitterness of the unionist toward
strike breakers as a class.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Negroes have often expressed themselves as having
little faith in the union labor movement because the unions have manifested
prejudices against permitting them to share equal benefits of membership;
and again they have gained their first opportunity in a new industry frequently
through the desire of a strike-bound employer to keep his plant running when
his white employees have walked out.
</p>

<p>
From its beginning the American Federation of Labor has declared a
uniform policy of non-racial discrimination, but this policy has not been
carried out in practice by all its constituent or affiliated bodies. At several
of its conventions resolutions have been passed embodying the official sentiment
of the federation, but no means has yet been discovered to effect a uniform
policy of fair dealing throughout all its affiliated bodies. Aside from those
unions in which the membership privilege for Negroes is modified, eight of the
110 national or international unions affiliated with the American Federation of
Labor explicitly bar the Negro by provisions in their constitutions or rituals.
These unions are: Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, Brotherhood of Railway
Carmen of America, International Association of Machinists, American
Association of Masters, Mates, and Pilots, Railway Mail Association, Order of
Railroad Telegraphers, the Commercial Telegraphers' Union of America, and
American Wire Weavers' Protective Association.
</p>

<p>
The general exclusion policy of the railway brotherhoods and several
unions of the Railway Department of the American Federation of Labor has
created a feeling of bitterness among Negroes, many of whom are employed
in branches of the railway service. As a protest against this policy there has
been formed the Railway Men's International Benevolent Industrial Association
with seventeen locals in Chicago and a local membership of 1,200. Mr.
Mays, president of this organization, stated that its purpose was merely to safeguard
the ranks of Negro workers, and said that it was ready to merge itself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_628' name='Page_628' href='#Page_628'>628</a></span>
into the general unions as soon as they were ready to accept them without
discrimination and accord the same privileges as white railway workers.
</p>

<p>
The Commission obtained information from local unions in Chicago with
a membership of 294,437, of whom 12,106 were Negroes. On the basis of
policy toward the Negro, unions in Chicago may be divided into four classes
or types:
</p>

<p>
A. Unions admitting Negroes to white locals
</p>

<p>
B. Unions admitting Negroes to separate or co-ordinate locals
</p>

<p>
C. Unions admitting Negroes to subordinate or auxiliary locals
</p>

<p>
D. Unions excluding Negroes from membership
</p>

<p>
Wherever and whenever Negroes are admitted on an equal basis and
given a square deal, the feeling inside the union is nearly always harmonious.
Examples of type A are the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen
of the World, Hodcarriers, Flat Janitors, and Ladies' Garment Workers.
In some of these organizations Negroes hold office.
</p>

<p>
Unions of type B give as reasons for organizing Negroes into separate locals,
first, preference of Negro workers for locals of their own, and, second, unwillingness
of white workers to admit Negroes to white locals. The Negro Musicians'
Union belongs to this type and has the same wage scale as the white union.
There appears to be little difficulty here because there is no conflict in contracts
for work in the city. The painters, however, have had difficulties which have
"hung fire" for more than a year; after being given a temporary charter
they still were unable to work.
</p>

<p>
Unions of type C, admitting Negroes to subordinate locals, are few in
number, apparently because Negroes strongly resent this form of affiliation.
There is, however, one example of this type which permits Negro helpers in a
certain trade to be organized as an auxiliary under the jurisdiction of the
white local unions having jurisdiction over their district. By constitution
it is provided that their minutes be submitted to the white locals and their
grievances placed before the white locals. The constitution also provides
that there shall be no transfer of colored helpers to any except Negro auxiliaries,
and that Negro helpers shall not be promoted to skilled trades or to
helper apprentice, and shall not be admitted to shops where white helpers
are employed. These Negro locals are represented by delegates selected by
the white locals in their districts.
</p>

<p>
Unions of type D, excluding the Negro from membership, do so either
in conformity with the laws of their national unions or in the exercise of local
option. In addition to the eight internationals which exclude the Negro by
constitutional provision, there are other locals which are known to reject
Negro applicants. The Machinists' Union, for example, although complying
in its constitution with the American Federation of Labor policy of no racial
discrimination, still effectually bars the Negro by a provision in its secret
ritual. With the Machinists' Union must be grouped such unions as the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_629' name='Page_629' href='#Page_629'>629</a></span>
Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' International Alliance, the Electrical
Workers, and the Plumbers and Steam Fitters.
</p>

<p>
Some Negro leaders, in view of these practices, have been strong in
their advocacy of non-affiliation with union organizations, holding that the
employers, after all, offer for Negroes the fairer terms, and that they have,
in fact, given Negroes their first opportunity in industry. However, certain
other Negroes have taken advantage of the rift between employers and labor
unions to exploit Negro laborers. They have played upon racial sentiment
to establish separate unions for Negroes, both in lines of work where they are
admitted to the general unions and in lines of work where they are excluded.
This type of leadership has been irresponsible and dangerous; it has made
ridiculously generous promises, and has addressed its appeal to the less intelligent
classes of Negro workers. Its literature has in turn provoked extreme
bitterness among labor union members and officials, who have mistakenly
accepted it as representative of the sentiment of all Negro workers.
</p>

<p>
Interviews with Negro workers outside of the unions reveal an attitude
of indifference or suspicion which is attributed by both white and Negro
labor leaders and union men to the following reasons: (1) the usual treatment
of Negroes by white men, (2) traditional treatment of Negroes by white men,
(3) influence of racial leaders who oppose unionism, (4) influence of employers'
propaganda against unionism. Many of them, it was learned, have a distorted
view of the purposes and principles of unionism, and many others, while
sympathetic with the movement, object to the practices of the locals. An
experience frequently referred to was the waiters' strike in 1911, when Negro
union men walked out with white union men and were replaced by white girls,
while the white union men returned to their jobs; since that time Negro waiters
have been out of the more desirable hotel jobs.
</p>

<p>
The explanations by labor leaders of the practices of local unions are to the
effect that while the general public race prejudice might be expected in organizations
of white workingmen, the unions, as a group, are fairer to the Negro
than other groups; that unions are blamed for conditions which are really
due to general public opinion. They cite as an example the fact that Negroes
are not employed in Chicago as motormen or conductors on the surface or
elevated lines because of public objection, and that they cannot be organized
until they are in positions. Views were also expressed in condemnation of
the exclusion policy of one local. These union officials believe that the unions
will eventually be the most powerful agencies in the removal of race prejudice.
</p>

<h3>
VI. <span class="smcap">Public Opinion in Race Relations</span>
</h3>

<h4>
A. OPINIONS OF WHITES AND NEGROES
</h4>

<p>
The "Negro problem" is deeper and wider than the difficulties which
center about the more specialized problems of Negro housing, Negro crime,
and industrial relations involving Negroes. All such special studies conducted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_630' name='Page_630' href='#Page_630'>630</a></span>
by the Commission left a baffling residuum of causes of racial discord, deep
rooted in the psychology of the white and Negro groups in contact. The
beliefs and attitudes, firmly fixed and accepted prejudices of the one race as
to the other, grouped under the term "public opinion," thus became the subject
of a novel but most interesting inquiry.
</p>

<p>
Public opinion with respect to the Negro forms a body of sentiment so
definite and compact as to make it an excellent laboratory case for analysis
and study; but the Commission's aim in investigating it was merely to make
apparent and objective its place and importance in race relations; to indicate
some of the ways in which it has developed; how it expresses itself; how it
affects both the white and Negro groups; how, in its present state, it is
strengthened, weakened, polluted, or purified by deliberate agencies or even
by its own action; and finally how it may be used to reduce, if not prevent,
racial unfriendliness and misunderstanding.
</p>

<p>
Public opinion is regarded here as a phase of the social mind, but nevertheless
as a definite reality. For purposes of examination, therefore, its study
gives attention to that body of sentiments, beliefs, attitudes, and prejudices
which, taken together, give to public opinion its content and meaning.
</p>

<p>
To present this subject intelligently, the following plan has been employed:
</p>

<p>
1. Beliefs and sophistications regarding Negroes, which exercise so great
an influence in determining the conduct of white persons in relation to them, are
described as they apply in the local environment, and in origin and background
are traced suggestively to their responsible sources in literature and circumstance.
</p>

<p>
2. Types of sentiment which, in Chicago and similar northern communities,
are variants of these basic beliefs are presented with a view to making them
intelligible and classifying them according to resolvable factors of misunderstanding.
</p>

<p>
3. Since personal attitudes and beliefs are molded by traditions and heritages
apart from the exclusive influence of literature, more significant material
collected through intimate inquiry is presented objectively to describe the
processes by which they appear to be created and grow. Replies to a searching
questionnaire on attitudes and opinions are, in the instances quoted, the
result of painstaking self-analysis.
</p>

<p>
4. The opinions and sentiments of Negroes on these same issues are
described and illustrated with a view to making them understandable, and
their interpretations of current white sentiment are explained as far as possible.
</p>

<p>
5. The report then turns to the agencies by which these opinions are made
and perpetuated and the individual attitudes created. The chief of these
are: (<i>a</i>) the press, (<i>b</i>) rumors, (<i>c</i>) myths, (<i>d</i>) propaganda. The conscious
and unconscious abuse of these instruments of "opinion making" is pointed
out and explained.
</p>

<p>
6. Finally, the study is intended to suggest means by which public opinion,
where it is faulty, may correct itself and employ its own instruments in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_631' name='Page_631' href='#Page_631'>631</a></span>
creation of wholesome sentiments among Negroes with respect to whites,
and among whites with respect to Negroes.
</p>

<h5>
1. BELIEFS OF WHITES CONCERNING NEGROES
</h5>

<p>
The conduct of individuals is largely determined by their attitudes toward
a subject and their general beliefs concerning it. Definite beliefs concerning
Negroes may be found in the North as well as in the South, varying with the
individuals who hold them, according to degrees of contact with the Negro
group and the individuals' traditional background. These may be divided
according to their character and effect into two general classes: (<i>a</i>) primary
beliefs or those fundamental and firmly established convictions which have,
all around, the deepest effect on the conduct of whites toward Negroes and are
pretentiously supported by statistics, authorities, and scientific research;
(<i>b</i>) secondary beliefs, or modifications and variants of important assumptions
as to cardinal attributes.
</p>

<p>
<i>a</i>) <i>Primary beliefs.</i>â€”Among these primary beliefs are the following:
</p>

<p>
1. Mentality: That the mind of the Negro is distinctly and distinctively
inferior to that of the white race. Some believe that this is due to backwardness
in ascending the scale of civilization; some that the Negro belongs to a
different species of the human family.
</p>

<p>
2. Morality: That Negroes are not yet capable of exercising social
restraints common to white persons; that they are unmoral as well as immoral.
</p>

<p>
3. Criminality: That Negroes possess a constitutional character weakness,
and a consequent predisposition to sexual crimes, petty stealing, and crimes of
violence.
</p>

<p>
4. Physical unattractiveness: That physical laws prompt whites to avoid
contact with Negroes.
</p>

<p>
5. Emotionality: That Negroes are highly emotional and for that reason
are given to quick, uncalculated crimes of violence as easily as to noisy and
emotional religious expressions.
</p>

<p>
<i>b</i>) <i>Secondary beliefs.</i>â€”As continued repetition of any plausible statement
without correction of its error eventually gives it credence, these secondary
beliefs have rooted themselves deep in the public mind. Among other things
it is believed that Negroes are: (1) lazy, (2) "happy-go-lucky," (3) boisterous,
(4) bumptious, (5) over-assertive, (6) lacking in civic consciousness, (7) addicted
to carrying razors, (8) fond of shooting craps, (9) flashy in dress and like gaudy,
brilliant colors, especially red.
</p>

<h5>
2. BACKGROUND OF PREVAILING BELIEFS CONCERNING NEGROES
</h5>

<p>
Soon after the first emergence of Negroes from slavery their illiteracy and
general behavior in response to the novel experience of freedom created situations
which appeared to justify judgments concerning their group traits.
Scholars rationalized and tried to explain these apparent traits: If they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_632' name='Page_632' href='#Page_632'>632</a></span>
illiterate as a group they must be incapable of learning, and if they committed
crimes, they must be fundamentally lacking in social restraints.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Jeffries Wyman, of Harvard, Professor A. H. Keene, author of <i>Man
Past and Present</i>, Dr. J. C. Nott, author of <i>Types of Mankind</i>, and almost all the
other anthropologists of that period, gave the stamp of scientific authority to
the view that Negroes were of a different species and could never reach the
level of the Caucasian. Even more recently mental tests were carried out
on the same assumption and were made to prove it in some instances where
the facts were unexpectedly contrary. Students of the race problem in the
South continued to generalize about Negro character from selected specimens,
other more popular writers and speakers, with their anecdotes, stories, and
jokes, all of which went uncorrected, tended to strengthen this body of beliefs
to a point where any difference of views was intolerable. Although the status
of the Negro has changed, the beliefs remain the same, and have led to bitterness
and resentment among Negroes, with consequent misunderstandings and
friction.
</p>

<p>
In Chicago sentiments collected from a wide variety of sources and involving
the views of several thousands of white persons indicate the persistence of
these archaic beliefs and fears, so deep set and of such long standing that they
are assumed by many persons to be instinctive.
</p>

<p>
To secure definite information upon the traditional background of beliefs
concerning Negroes, fifteen white persons with no special interest in Negroes
were selected at random from professions, business, and other vocations and
submitted to a careful and searching inquiry. They were asked eighteen
carefully prepared questions to draw out the raw material of their unqualified
reactions on the question of the Negro and, as far as possible, the background
in their early experience. They were asked for their opinions concerning
Negroes, whether or not they believed that they possessed distinguishing
traits of mentality and character; their attitudes were solicited by questions
and propositions designed to provoke an expression of attitude. Questions
were put regarding instances and experiences involving Negroes in their
early experience; their first consciousness of racial differences; their first
contacts; and information was sought on the definite sources of their knowledge
or opinions concerning Negroes.
</p>

<p>
All the persons questioned had clear-cut opinions and thought that Negroes
possessed distinguishing traits ranging from "affectionate loyalty" to "mental
and moral handicaps imposed by evolution." An abolitionist's son, for
example, thought that "Negroes should desire segregation"; a man who had
observed Negroes at Tuskegee and Lewis institutes would increase their education
and meet the demands produced by education. One whose only contact
had been with his "black mammy" thought that the Negroes were "affectionate
and loyal, but lacking in racial pride, though evolutionarily handicapped,
possessing the qualities of children." Another who had had an unfortunate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_633' name='Page_633' href='#Page_633'>633</a></span>
experience with his Negro chauffeur thought that Negroes were characterized by
"distinctly inferior mentality, deficient moral sense, shiftlessness, good-natured,
and a happy disposition." They knew little about the activities of
Negroes, their leaders, their papers, or their problems, and the sources on which
they relied for their information, except in two instances, were undependable.
</p>

<h5>
3. NEGRO OPINION
</h5>

<p>
Negroes, although exposed to various forms of social contact, have been
intellectually isolated from the white group. They have not participated fully
and freely in community and cultural activities. The pressure of the white
group in practically every ordinary experience has kept their attention and
interest centered upon themselves, and they have become race conscious.
Their thinking, therefore, on general questions, whether they involve race
relations or not, is conditioned and largely controlled by the relation of these
questions with group interests. The opinions of Negroes, therefore, on race
relations are largely negative. White persons know very little about what
Negroes are thinking, because they are not familiar with their experiences;
they frequently do not accredit them with the sensibilities that they do possess;
and are not acquainted with the processes of thought by which the opinions of
Negroes are formed. Thus it is that many of the statements and expressions
of feeling of Negroes are unintelligible to persons outside of their group.
Similarly, many statements and expressions of feeling by white persons are
unintelligible to Negroes. But in the understanding of white persons Negroes
have the advantage, because they do read their papers, see them in the
privacy of their homes, and are forced constantly to interpret their actions.
</p>

<p>
Among Negroes there may be found a group control as strong and binding
as among white persons. One striking instance of the operation of this group
control was the complete ostracism of a prominent Negro lawyer who was
reported to have made a public statement contrary to the views and aspirations
held by his group. When this Negro was reported in the press to have said,
"This is a white man's country, and Negroes had better behave or they will
get what rights they have taken away," he was first snubbed, then his life
was threatened, and for several weeks he was forced to go about under police
protection. He was seriously criticized and finally ostracized. In less than
a year he died. His friends declare that he was slanderously misquoted.
</p>

<p>
The sentiments of Negroes fall into somewhat the same classification as
those of whites, but with one or two notable exceptions: there is (1) more discussion
of race problems, more criticism of the conduct of leaders, more discussion
of the practicability of programs of action; and (2) a great deal of literature
and other expressions concerning the development of a defensive philosophy.
In this latter are included various defensive policies, the stimulation of race
pride, the explanation of behavior, and the struggle for status. There might
also be included frequent evidences of the development of race consciousness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_634' name='Page_634' href='#Page_634'>634</a></span>
The emotional background, class consciousness, and the influences of group
control are as evident in the sentiments of Negroes as of white persons.
</p>

<p>
A wide selection of views was obtained from Negroes and presented under
the classifications in which they appeared naturally to fall. To get a more
precise statement of views, a questionnaire was sent to Negroes representing
a class intellectually able to subject themselves to self-analysis and to discuss
various confusing angles of the race question. They were asked concerning
interracial problems; whether or not race relations appear to be growing better
or worse; whether the acquisition of wealth, or 100 per cent literacy, or unrestricted
suffrage could affect race relations; they were asked questions concerning
their adjustment to the present social system, their most pronounced
mental complexes experienced in adjusting personal desires to the present
social system; whether they were prejudiced against white persons; whether
or not they were conscious of a feeling of race inferiority, or of a desire to
compensate for a supposed inferiority. Concerning Negro problems they were
asked whether or not there should be recognized leaders of Negroes; their
criticisms of the policies of Negro leaders. Their racial philosophy was
solicited. They were asked the distinction that they made between segregation
and racial solidarity, and information was sought on the agencies responsible
for their opinions. A most interesting array of views was secured, ranging
from suspicion and abuse of the questions themselves to dispassionate
analysis.
</p>

<p>
The war has produced a new type of sentiment. It not only brought
disappointment and disillusionment for Negroes led into a new hope by the
promises that accompanied the manifest efforts to stimulate patriotism, but
actually gave to Negroes new experiences. Following the return of Negro
soldiers from France, measures of restraint were increased, and from the
usual lawlessness of the period of reconstruction they probably suffered more
severely than others because they are to a much larger extent dependent
upon law enforcement for security and comfort. Race riots, which are an
expression of both loose machinery of community control and the development
of a more determined resistance on the part of Negroes, grew more frequent
in number and more serious in consequences. A new note was sounded in
radical Negro literature, which appeared to carry a very popular appeal.
</p>

<h4>
B. FACTORS IN THE MAKING OF PUBLIC OPINION
</h4>

<h5>
1. THE WHITE PRESS OF CHICAGO
</h5>

<p>
Aside from the agencies ordinarily responsible for providing the individual
with his views, there are others equally as powerful in developing and influencing
opinions. Most important of these is the press. For that portion of the
public which depends upon the press for its contact with the Negro group
and its information concerning it, this agency holds a controlling hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_635' name='Page_635' href='#Page_635'>635</a></span>
Throughout the country it is pointed out, by both whites and Negroes, that
the policies of many newspapers on racial matters have made relations more
difficult, at times fostering new antagonisms and even precipitating riots by
inflaming the white public against Negroes. A study was made of the three
principal white daily newspapers of Chicago, covering a two-year period.
Included in this study were 1,347 news items, 108 letters to the press, and
ninety-six editorials on the Negro.
</p>

<p>
As an example of the type of publicity given to racial news concerning
Negroes and the types of articles considered to have good news value, of the
1,338 articles published, 606, or nearly 50 per cent, dealt with riots, crime,
and vice. Each of these articles specifically identified the persons involved as
Negroes.
</p>

<p>
Constant identification of Negroes with certain definite crimes could have
no other effect than to stamp the entire Negro group in the public mind as
generally criminal. This in turn contributes to the already existing belief
that Negroes as a group are more likely to be criminal than others, and thus
they are arrested more readily than others. Publication of their names with
race identification and with the crimes alleged against them keeps up a vicious
circle. The unfortunate emphasis on sex offenses involving race, the subtle
fanning of latent animosities by innuendo and suggestion, attaching the crime
not only to the individual but to the race, direct a current of fear, intolerance,
and ill will against the whole Negro group. An apt illustration, frequently
cited by Negroes, is that if each time a crime was committed by a red-headed
man, he was so described in telling of his crime, a popular fear and prejudice
would soon develop against all red-headed men.
</p>

<p>
Crimes involving Negroes alone receive little attention. As with the
Italians, as long as crimes are committed within the group, and this group is
regarded as an isolated appendix of the community, they hold very little news
value. When, however, a member of the isolated group comes into conflict
with the community group, whether in industry, housing, or any relation, its
representative significance is thus established, and the information becomes
news. Publicity on housing, for example, stresses the conflict with other
neighborhoods, the "invasion" of white districts, and plans for segregation.
News items on politics involving Negroes get more space and prominence
when they describe graft and corruption. In the list of articles studied are
included sixty-three articles particularly ridiculing the Negro group.
</p>

<p>
Incidents occurring during the activities of the Commission were checked
up with reports of them appearing in the papers, and serious misrepresentations
of the Negro group were revealed. One example was an article in the <i>Herald-Examiner</i>
on January 4, 1920, with two-inch headlines across the entire first
page: "Reds Plot Negro Revolt," "I.W.W. Bomb Plant Found on South
Side." The article mentioned the alleged secret activities of Negroes and their
plans to revolt against the government. The bomb plant and many of their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_636' name='Page_636' href='#Page_636'>636</a></span>
secret plans were reported to have been discovered by the state's attorney.
The article further said: "In Chicago it was learned that the headquarters
for Negro revolutionary propaganda are centered in these four organizations:
the Free Thought Society, Universal Negro Improvement Association, Negro
Protective League, and the Soldiers and Sailors Club." The article and the
reported "discoveries" of the state's attorney's office are evidence of the
absurd ignorance frequently manifested by members of the white group concerning
the activities of Negroes. Each of the organizations named was
known to the Commission and visited by its representatives on numbers of
occasions. All of their meetings are open to the public, though attended
almost entirely by Negroes. The Universal Negro Improvement Association
publishes all of its plans in its newspaper, the <i>Negro World</i>. Its slogan is
"Back to Africa" and not "Down with the United States." The Free Thought
Society mentioned is an organization designed to provide a medium of expression
for persons who seek the "attainment of truth." Its discussions concern
religion and philosophy, and it numbers among its members prominent Negro
and white professional men. The Negro Protective League is an employment
office and day nursery. The full name of the organization is the "Negro
Equal Rights and Protective Association." The Soldiers and Sailors Club
is a community house located on the South Side and a branch of the local
War Camp Community Service. Eugene T. Lies, formerly of the United
Charities, was its director. The occasion of the publicity in question was a
convention of a national Negro Greek-letter fraternity, which held its meetings
in the auditorium of the Soldiers and Sailors Club. This fraternity, like all
others of its kind, excluded non-members and by so doing aroused the suspicion
of the newspaper's informants. No correction appeared in the paper, and to
date no further "discoveries" have been made.
</p>

<p>
Articles of this type illustrate the possible effect on the public mind of such
misrepresentations of the Negro. One newspaper has abandoned its policy
of identifying Negroes with reports of incidents, in recognition of the gross
unfairness of the practice.
</p>

<h5>
2. THE NEGRO PRESS
</h5>

<p>
The development of the Negro press was stimulated by several necessities
important among which were:
</p>

<p>
<i>a</i>) The indifference of the white press to the Negro group; its emphasis
on the unfortunately spectacular, and the consequent loss of items of interest
about Negroes throughout the country.
</p>

<p>
<i>b</i>) The importance of developing the morale of the Negro group, creating
a solidarity of interest and purpose for measures of defense, correcting the
impressions created by general opinion, and centering the attention of Negroes
upon themselves and their advancement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_637' name='Page_637' href='#Page_637'>637</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Three of the most important local Negro weekly papers were studied. Their
news items showed bias in reporting just the reverse of that which characterizes
the reports of many white papers. They emphasize the Negro's view and may
be said to provide a compensatory interpretation of the news. When, for
example, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> reports the approval in the Illinois Constitutional
Convention of a civil-rights bill with the headline: "Miscegenation Is
O.K.'d in New Constitution; Negroes Given All the Rights of Whites," the
<i>Chicago Whip</i>, a Negro newspaper, headlines the same incident: "Morris
Gets Civil Rights into Constitution; Victory for Race Won at Springfield."
</p>

<p>
The most important function exercised by the Negro press is its control
of the Negro group and of their education in conduct. All of these papers give
considerable space to such popular education.
</p>

<h5>
3. RUMOR
</h5>

<p>
Rumor, if unchecked, can do incalculable damage to race relations.
Included under the term "rumor" are those unfounded tales, incorrectly
deduced conclusions, partial statements of fact with significant content added
by the narrator, all of which are given wide circulation and easy credence by
the public. Other forms of rumor are tales of unheard-of brutality and of plots
and plans which are either fabrications or partial statements of fact and
serve only to stimulate resentment, fear, and a desire for retaliation. Of the
rumors predicting riots, one example will illustrate: During the riot a white
man was caught in the act of crawling beneath a house in which Negroes
lived. In his pocket was found a bottle of kerosene. He confessed that his
mission was arson and justified his act by repeating to the police the current
rumor that it was known that Negroes had set fire to the houses of whites
"back of the Yards."
</p>

<p>
A persistent tale circulated during and for a long time after the riot was
to the effect that the bodies of hundreds of Negroes were taken from Bubbly
Creek where they had been thrown after being killed by white rioters. The
story was so frequently repeated that it was accepted and even repeated
in Congress. It caused an intense feeling among Negroes. Investigation by
the coroner, Police Department, and other agencies showed that no bodies had
ever been thrown into Bubbly Creek or recovered from it.
</p>

<p>
A rumor given official sanction and carried into the files of the Department
of Justice illustrates other possible dangers of this kind. This rumor concerned
two prominent and highly accredited organizations for Negroes. Rumors
connected them with "I.W.W. plots and plans to overthrow the government."
These reports were founded upon scarcely anything more than suspicion due
to lack of information and acquaintance with the Negro group. The National
Urban League, for example, an organization of responsible Negroes and whites
with branches in thirty-one cities, was reported to have asked William D.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_638' name='Page_638' href='#Page_638'>638</a></span>
Haywood, head of the I.W.W., to speak at its convention in Detroit. This
report grew out of the misreading of the name of William Hayward, a United
States district attorney in New York, who is a member of the executive board
and whose name appears on the stationery of the organization. The National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, also a reputable organization
of whites and Negroes, was reported to be "planning to flood the colored
districts with I.W.W. literature." This was entirely false, but the reports
went to the Department of Justice headquarters secretly and could not be
corrected by the persons most affected.
</p>

<h5>
4. MYTHS
</h5>

<p>
Group myths, like those about the American Indian, the Oriental, and
the Jew, are very common. Usually they are the expression either of a wish
or of fear, which sociologists call a negative wish. Mythical stories and
anecdotes about Negroes, accepted by whites, are usually popular. Many of
them may have had a reasonable origin, but as a matter of fact have long
outgrown it. So long as they are uncorrected they hold and exercise a marked
degree of control over personal conduct.
</p>

<p>
In the category of myths fall the popular beliefs of whites concerning the
mentality of Negroes, and the more definite myth that the mind of the Negro
child ceases to develop when he reaches the age of puberty. The sex myth
is always in evidence. It involves the fear obsession of Negro men held by
many white women, fear of miscegenation, the condonation of lynchings,
repressive social restrictions, as well as attempts at legislative restraints.
Negroes are by these myths shown to have a predilection for sex crimes. This
sex myth has been stressed in almost every riot. It precipitated the Washington
riot; it provoked the most brutal murder of the Chicago riot, and it was responsible
for the brutality of the Omaha and Tulsa riots. Always resident in the
background of popular consciousness, it shows the same head and features
in almost every clash of races.
</p>

<h5>
5. PROPAGANDA
</h5>

<p>
Conscious control of public opinion by propaganda has been used with
tremendous effect by social, political, and religious organizations seeking
popularity and support for their movements and reforms. Both Negroes and
whites employed propaganda, sometimes openly, sometimes insidiously. Racial
propaganda has probably a more powerful appeal than any other type
because it is based upon the instinct of race and race differences, rivalry and
jealousy. The most common forms of propaganda may be classified into the
following types: (<i>a</i>) educational, (<i>b</i>) radical and revolutionary, (<i>c</i>) defensive,
(<i>d</i>) malicious.
</p>

<p>
The activities and programs of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People fall under the classification of educational propaganda;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_639' name='Page_639' href='#Page_639'>639</a></span>
this propaganda is directed to the white public principally and is intended to
change public opinion by providing a foundation of actual facts for the public's
judgment.
</p>

<p>
The more striking examples of the radical and revolutionary propaganda
are the appeals sent out by the Industrial Workers of the World to Negroes,
carrying their doctrines and extending open arms to Negro workers and offering
them what most other organizations refuseâ€”the privilege of association and
membership on the basis of brotherhood.
</p>

<p>
Defensive propaganda is more apparent within the Negro group and is
usually designed for the purpose of combating aggression and injury to their
purposes and aspirations from without. The appeals of this propaganda are
directed first to Negroes as a means of cementing the group from within, and
indirectly to the white group by way of impressing them with the strength
of solidified opposition to insults. The Protective Circle of Chicago, organized
to "oppose segregation, bombing, and defiance of the Constitution," admitted
employing propaganda to accomplish its purpose.
</p>

<p>
Malicious propaganda is by far the most dangerous because it is founded
upon race antagonism. In the appeal to the emotions facts are soon lost.
Anti-Negro propaganda is not wholly new in the North, but when employed
it has usually been done insidiously because "Negro-baiting is considered in
bad taste." Recently, however, there have been conspicuous instances of
open and organized efforts to influence the minds of whites against Negroes.
Ignorance and suspicion, fear and prejudice, have been played upon deliberately.
The stated purpose of the propaganda was to unite white property
owners in opposition to the "invasion" of other residential areas by Negroes,
but in the actual carrying out of the propaganda it was extended to all Negroes,
and many methods were employed which could have no other effect than to
arouse bitterness and antagonism leading to clashes. The <i>Property Owners'
Journal</i>, the organ of an association of real estate men, became so violent in
its preachments that the protest of whites forced its discontinuance. Appeals
were made not only to the instinct of race but to the sex instincts and the
protective instincts of white men. A pamphlet sent to the wives of prominent
residents in that neighborhood, entitled <i>An Appeal of White Women to American
Humanity</i>, recounted the "horrible conduct of French Colonials on the Rhine
and the abuse of German white women," although there was little apparent
connection between the conduct of Chicago Negroes and that of the black
soldiers in the French Army of Occupation on the Rhine. This pamphlet,
however, served to increase the fears of Negro men by white women and to arouse
the resentment and hatred of white men.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_640' name='Page_640' href='#Page_640'>640</a></span>
</p>

<h3>
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION
</h3>

<p>
Many of our citizens who were appalled by the rioting and murders of 1919,
feeling the need of a solution of the problem dealt with in this investigation,
have hoped that this Commission might suggest some ready remedy, some
quick means of assuring harmony between the races.
</p>

<p>
Careful consideration of the facts set forth in this report shows that no
such suggestion is possible. No one, white or Negro, is wholly free from an
inheritance of prejudice in feeling and in thinking as to these questions. Mutual
understanding and sympathy between the races will be followed by harmony
and co-operation. But these can come completely only after the disappearance
of prejudice. Thus the remedy is necessarily slow; and it is all the more
important that the civic conscience of the community should be aroused, and
that progress should begin in a direction steadily away from the disgrace of 1919.
</p>

<p>
Each member of this Commission feels that he has more understanding and
less prejudice than before its work began. Therefore we recommend the thoughtful
examination of the body of this report, so that all who read our recommendations
may weigh for themselves the evidence upon which they are based.
</p>

<p>
Having in mind the basic facts in the problem of race relations and the
conclusions from a careful study of the various phases of these relations in
Chicago, the Commission presents for the consideration and action of state
and local authorities, and of the social agencies and citizens of Chicago, the
following recommendations and suggestions.
</p>

<h4>
To the Police, Militia, State's Attorney, and Courts:
</h4>

<h5>
HANDLING OF RIOTS
</h5>

<p>
1. We recommend that the police and militia work out, at the earliest
possible date, a detailed plan for joint action in the control of race riots.
</p>

<p>
2. In accordance with such a plan, and in the event of race rioting, we
specifically recommend: (<i>a</i>) that the militia, white and Negro, be promptly
mobilized at the beginning of the outbreak; (<i>b</i>) that police and deputy sheriffs
and militia, white and Negro, be so distributed as adequately to protect both
races in white and Negro neighborhoods and to avoid the gross inequalities
of protection which, in the riot of 1919, permitted widespread depredations,
including murder, against Negroes in white neighborhoods, and attacks in
Negro neighborhoods by invading white hoodlums; (<i>c</i>) that the police and
militia be stationed with special reference to main street-car lines and transfer
points used by Negroes in getting to and from work; (<i>d</i>) that substantial
assurance be given of adequate and equal protection by all agencies of law
enforcement, thus removing the incentive to arm in self-defense; (<i>e</i>) that in
the appointment of special peace officers there shall be no discrimination
against Negroes; (<i>f</i>) that all rioters, white and Negro, be arrested without
race discrimination; (<i>g</i>) that all reports and complaints of neglect of duty
or participation in rioting by police, deputy sheriffs, or militia be promptly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_641' name='Page_641' href='#Page_641'>641</a></span>
investigated and the offenders promptly punished; (<i>h</i>) that all persons arrested
in connection with rioting be systematically booked on distinct charges showing
such connection, in order to avoid the confusion and evasions of justice following
the riot of 1919.
</p>

<p>
3. We recommend that, without regard to color, all persons arrested in
connection with rioting be promptly tried and the guilty speedily punished.
</p>

<h5>
BOMBINGS
</h5>

<p>
4. We recommend prompt and vigorous action by the police, state's
attorney, and courts to suppress the bombings of Negro and white houses,
these acts being criminal and likely to provoke race rioting.
</p>

<p>
5. The testimony of court officials before the Commission and its investigations
indicate that Negroes are more commonly arrested, subjected to police
identification, and convicted than white offenders, that on similar evidence
they are generally held and convicted on more serious charges, and that they
are given longer sentences. We point out that these practices and tendencies
are not only unfair to Negroes, but weaken the machinery of justice and,
when taken with the greater inability of Negroes to pay fines in addition to or
in lieu of terms in jail, produce misleading statistics of Negro crime. We recognize
that these practices and tendencies are in a large degree the unconscious
results of traditional race prejudice. We recommend to the police, state's
attorney, judges, and juries that they consider these conditions in the effort
to deal fairly (and without discrimination) with all persons charged with crime.
</p>

<p>
6. We recommend that, in order to encourage respect for law by both
Negroes and whites, the courts discountenance the facetiousness which is too
common in dealing with cases in which Negroes are involved.
</p>

<h5>
VICIOUS ENVIRONMENT
</h5>

<p>
7. We recommend that the police, state's attorney, and other authorities
promptly rid the Negro residence areas of vice resorts, whose present exceptional
prevalence in such areas is due to official laxity.
</p>

<h5>
POLICING OF PARKS AND BEACHES
</h5>

<p>
8. We recommend better co-operation between the city and park police
in and near parks, bathing-beaches, and other public recreation places, especially
where there has been or is likely to be race friction; and in the speedy
punishment of persons guilty of stoning houses, molesting individuals, or committing
other depredations calculated to arouse race antagonism.
</p>

<h5>
"ATHLETIC CLUBS"
</h5>

<p>
9. We recommend that the police pay particular and continuous attention
to the so-called "athletic clubs" on the South Side, which we have found to
be a fruitful source of race conflict, and that when race conflict arises or is
imminent the members and meeting places of such clubs be searched for arms
and that, if deemed necessary, such clubs be closed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_642' name='Page_642' href='#Page_642'>642</a></span>
</p>

<h5>
THE BARRETT MURDER
</h5>

<p>
10. We commend the police for the prompt and effective action in the
Barrett murder case, September 20, 1920, which allayed public alarm and
averted a serious clash.
</p>

<h4>
To the City Council and Administrative Boards, the Park Boards and the
Municipal Bureau of Parks, Playgrounds, and Bathing-Beaches:
</h4>

<h5>
CONTROL OF FIREARMS
</h5>

<p>
11. We recommend that the most stringent means possible be applied to
control the importation, sale, and possession of firearms and other deadly
weapons.
</p>

<h5>
SUPERVISION OF "ATHLETIC CLUBS"
</h5>

<p>
12. In order to facilitate police supervision of so-called "athletic clubs,"
we recommend that all such clubs be required to file with the city clerk statements
of their purposes and, at stated intervals, lists of their members and
officers, with their addresses.
</p>

<h5>
SANITATION
</h5>

<p>
13. We recommend that the authorities exercise their powers to condemn
and raze all houses unfit for human habitation, many of which the Commission
has found to exist in the Negro residence areas on the South and West sides.
</p>

<p>
14. We recommend better enforcement of health and sanitary laws and
regulations in the care, repair, and upkeep of streets and alleys and the collection
and disposal of rubbish and garbage in areas of Negro residence, where
the Commission has found these matters to be shamefully neglected.
</p>

<h5>
RECREATION CENTERS
</h5>

<p>
15. We recommend that the park and other proper authorities (<i>a</i>) put an
end to the present gross discrimination by white persons which practically
bars Negroes out of certain recreation centers near their own congested
residence area; and (<i>b</i>) that a recreation center of adequate size and facilities
be established for the use of both whites and Negroes in the principal Negro
residence area of the South Side; and (<i>c</i>) that steps be taken to secure more
adequately trained, competent, and intelligent playground and recreation-center
directors, white and Negro, who shall be held responsible for racial
clashes arising in places under their direction and shall be required to interest
themselves in reducing and avoiding racial friction in their neighborhoods;
and (<i>d</i>) that proper equipment and supervision be provided at the Twenty-sixth
Street Bathing-Beach, where they are now almost wholly lacking; and
(<i>e</i>) that, in co-operation with the city police, the park police adequately protect
all citizens, without regard to color, in going to and from parks, recreation
centers, and playgrounds.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_643' name='Page_643' href='#Page_643'>643</a></span>
</p>

<h4>
To the Board of Education:
</h4>

<h5>
MORE SCHOOLS IN NEGRO AREAS
</h5>

<p>
16. We recommend that in the areas where the main part of the Negro
population lives, and where elementary-school accommodations are notably
deficient, buildings, equipment, and teaching forces be provided which shall
be at least equal to the average standard for the city, in order that the present
conditions of overcrowding, arrangement of pupils in shifts, and the assignment
of too large classes to teachers may be remedied.
</p>

<h5>
NIGHT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY CENTERS
</h5>

<p>
17. We recommend the establishment of night schools and community
centers in sections of the city not now adequately provided with such facilities.
</p>

<h5>
COMPULSORY EDUCATION
</h5>

<p>
18. Having found that many Negro children who quit school at an early
age, as in the case of similar white children, appear later as criminals and
delinquents, we urge strict enforcement of regulations as to working permits
for such children, and we especially recommend that truant officers give attention
to school attendance by the children of Negro families migrating here
from the South.
</p>

<h5>
ATTITUDE OF PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS
</h5>

<p>
19. Since the attitude of principals and teachers vitally influences the
relations of white and Negro children in the public schools, we recommend
that special care be exercised in appointing principals and teachers who have
a sympathetic and intelligent interest in promoting good race relations in the
schools.
</p>

<h5>
STUDENT ACTIVITIES
</h5>

<p>
20. We recommend that public-school principals and teachers encourage
participation by children of both races in student activities as a means of
promoting mutual understanding and good race relations in such schools and
in the community.
</p>

<h4>
To Social and Civic Organizations, Labor Unions, and Churches:
</h4>

<h5>
PROMOTION OF RACE HARMONY
</h5>

<p>
21. Being convinced by our inquiry that much of the antagonism evinced
in the areas of marked hostility toward Negroes is founded upon tradition
which is itself without foundation in fact or justice, we recommend to schools,
social centers and agencies, churches, labor unions, and other organizations
in these areas, and to public-spirited citizens, white and Negro, that they
endeavor to dispel the false notions of each race about the other and promote
mutual tolerance and friendliness between them.
</p>

<p>
22. We recommend that both white and Negro churches seek and use
means to improve race relations, and that these means include the finding of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_644' name='Page_644' href='#Page_644'>644</a></span>
frequent occasion for having their congregations addressed by representatives
of both races on the subject of race sympathy and tolerance.
</p>

<h5>
SOCIAL AGENCIES IN NEGRO COMMUNITIES
</h5>

<p>
23. We commend the course of such agencies as the United Charities,
Illinois Children's Home and Aid Society, and American Red Cross in extending
their work to the Negro community, and recommend that other agencies
whose work is similarly useful extend their work in like manner.
</p>

<p>
24. Recognizing and commending the practical efforts of the Interracial
Committee of the Woman's City Club, the Public Affairs Committee of the
Union League Club, and the Chicago Urban League, in promoting better race
relations, especially in the summer of 1920, when racial friction was deemed
imminent, we recommend that other organizations of the same kind undertake
like activities.
</p>

<p>
25. We recommend that the appropriate social agencies give needed
attention to dealing extra-judicially with cases of Negroes coming before the
morals and juvenile courts; also to cases of Negro children dropping out of
school too early in age.
</p>

<h5>
OPPORTUNITY FOR RECREATION TRAINING
</h5>

<p>
26. We recommend that Negroes, as well as whites, be given opportunity
for training for service in the city's public recreation facilities.
</p>

<h4>
To the Public:
</h4>

<h5>
INTERRACIAL TOLERANCE
</h5>

<p>
27. We are convinced by our inquiry: (<i>a</i>) that measures involving or
approaching deportation or segregation are illegal, impracticable and would
not solve, but would accentuate, the race problem and postpone its just and
orderly solution by the process of adjustment; (<i>b</i>) that the moral responsibility
for race rioting does not rest upon hoodlums alone, but also upon all citizens,
white or black, who sanction force or violence in interracial relations or who
do not condemn and combat the spirit of racial hatred thus expressed; (<i>c</i>) that
race friction and antagonism are largely due to the fact that each race too
readily misunderstands and misinterprets the other's conduct and aspirations.
</p>

<p>
We therefore urge upon all citizens, white and Negro, active opposition
to the employment of force or violence in interracial relations and to the
spirit of antagonism and hatred. We recommend dispassionate, intelligent,
and sympathetic consideration by each race of the other's needs and aims;
we also recommend the dissemination of proved or trustworthy information
about all phases of race relations as a useful means for effecting peaceful
racial adjustment.
</p>

<p>
28. Since rumor, usually groundless, is a prolific source of racial bitterness
and strife, we warn both whites and Negroes against the acceptance or circulation
by either of reports about the other whose truth has not been fully established.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_645' name='Page_645' href='#Page_645'>645</a></span>
We urge all citizens, white and Negro, vigorously to oppose all propaganda
of malicious or selfish origin which would tend to excite race prejudice.
</p>

<p>
29. We commend race contacts in cultural and co-operative efforts as
tending strongly to mutual understanding and the promotion of good race
relations.
</p>

<p>
30. We condemn the provocation or fostering of race antagonism by
associations or organizations ostensibly founded or conducted for purposes
of patriotism or local improvements or the like.
</p>

<h5>
PERMANENT RACE-RELATIONS BODY
</h5>

<p>
31. We recommend as of special importance that a permanent local body
representing both races be charged with investigating situations likely to
produce clashes, with collecting and disseminating information tending to
preserve the peace and allay unfounded fears, with bringing sound public
sentiment to bear upon the settlement of racial disputes, and with promoting
the spirit of interracial tolerance and co-operation.
</p>

<h4>
To the White Members of the Public:
</h4>

<h5>
RACE ADJUSTMENT IN MIXED NEIGHBORHOODS
</h5>

<p>
32. We call to public attention the fact that intensity of racial feeling is
not necessarily due to the presence of Negroes in a neighborhood, either in the
majority or minority, and that such feeling is not the rule but the exception;
and we cite as a conspicuous example the peaceful conditions that have long
obtained in the area between Roosevelt Road and Thirty-ninth Street from
Wentworth Avenue to Lake Michigan, in which the Negro population in 1920
numbered 54,906 and the white population 42,797.
</p>

<h5>
BETTER NEGRO HOUSING WITHOUT SEGREGATION
</h5>

<p>
33. Our inquiry has shown that insufficiency in amount and quality of
housing is an all-important factor in Chicago's race problem; there must be
more and better housing to accommodate the great increase in Negro population
which was at the rate of 148 per cent from 1910 to 1920. This situation will
be made worse by methods tending toward forcible segregation or exclusion of
Negroes, such as the circulation of threatening statements and propaganda
by organizations or persons to prevent Negroes from living in certain areas,
and the lawless and perilous bombing of houses occupied by Negroes or by
whites suspected of encouraging Negro residence in the district.
</p>

<p>
We therefore recommend that all white citizens energetically discourage
these futile, pernicious, and lawless practices, and either co-operate in or
start movements to solve the housing problem by constructive and not destructive
methods.
</p>

<h5>
DEPRECIATION AND PROPERTY RISKS
</h5>

<p>
34. Testimony before the Commission and investigations made by it show
two important facts: (<i>a</i>) that depreciation of residence property generally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_646' name='Page_646' href='#Page_646'>646</a></span>
charged exclusively to the presence of Negroes in a neighborhood is often
largely due to other factors; (<i>b</i>) that many Negroes of this city meet their
obligations in such a manner as to make their home-building and home-owning
investments seem a more desirable risk than has been generally supposed.
We therefore recommend that these facts be taken into consideration
in connection with loans on Negro property.
</p>

<h5>
ADVANCED RENTS FOR NEGROES CONDEMNED
</h5>

<p>
35. We condemn and urge the discontinuance of the practice of property
owners who arbitrarily advance rents merely because Negroes become tenants.
</p>

<h5>
INFORMATION ABOUT NEGROES
</h5>

<p>
36. We recommend that white persons seek information from responsible
and representative Negroes as the basis of their judgments about Negro
traits, characteristics, and tendencies, and thereby counteract the common
disposition, arising from erroneous tradition and literature, to regard all
Negroes as belonging to one homogeneous group and as being inferior in mentality
and morality, given to emotionalism, and having an innate tendency
toward crime, especially sex crime.
</p>

<h4>
To the Negro Members of the Public:
</h4>

<h5>
RACIAL DOCTRINES
</h5>

<p>
37. We recommend to Negroes the promulgation of sound racial doctrines
among the uneducated members of their group, and the discouragement of
propaganda and agitators seeking to inflame racial animosity and incite
Negroes to violence.
</p>

<h5>
SUPPORT OF SOCIAL AGENCIES
</h5>

<p>
38. We urge Negroes to contribute more freely of their money and personal
effort to the social agencies developed by public-spirited members of their
group; also to contribute to the general social agencies of the community.
</p>

<h5>
SPECIAL PROBLEMS
</h5>

<p>
39. We recommend that the Negro community, through the extension
or establishment of the necessary social agencies, undertake to supply means
and encouragement for leisure activities, and undertake work among Negro
boys and girls along the lines of prevention of vice and crime; also that it
provide institutional care of dependent Negro children.
</p>

<p>
40. We particularly urge that Negroes vigorously and continuously protest
against the presence in their residence areas of any vicious resort, and that
they join in and support all efforts to suppress such places.
</p>

<h5>
ADJUSTMENT OF MIGRANTS
</h5>

<p>
41. We commend the important work done by the Chicago Urban League,
the Negro churches, and other organizations in facilitating the adjustment of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_647' name='Page_647' href='#Page_647'>647</a></span>
migrant Negroes from the South to the conditions of living in Chicago and
urge its extension. We also commend the work already done by Negroes
through community associations in bettering the appearance and sanitary
condition of housing and recommend its further extension.
</p>

<h5>
RACE PRIDE
</h5>

<p>
42. While we recognize the propriety and social values of race pride
among Negroes, we warn them that thinking and talking too much in terms
of race alone are calculated to promote separation of race interests and thereby
to interfere with racial adjustment.
</p>

<h4>
To Employers and Labor Organizations:
</h4>

<h5>
ATTITUDE TOWARD NEGRO WORKERS
</h5>

<p>
43. We have found that in struggles between capital and labor Negro
workers are in a position dangerous to themselves and to peaceful relations
between the races, whether the issues involve their use by employers to undermine
wage standards or break strikes, or efforts by organized labor to keep
them out of certain trades while refusing to admit them to membership in the
unions in such trades. We feel that unnecessary racial bitterness is provoked
by such treatment of Negro workers, that racial prejudice is played upon by
both parties, and that through such practices injury comes, not alone to
Negroes, but to employers and labor organizations as well.
</p>

<p>
We therefore recommend to employers that they deal with Negroes as
workmen on the same plane as white workers; and to labor unions that
they admit Negroes to full membership whenever they apply for it and possess
the qualifications required of white workers.
</p>

<h5>
NEGRO AND WHITE WORKERS
</h5>

<p>
44. We commend to the attention of employers who fear clashes or loss
of white workers by taking on Negro workers the fact that in 89 per cent of
the industries investigated by this Commission, Negroes were found working
in close association with white employees, and that friction between these
elements had rarely been manifested.
</p>

<h5>
INDUSTRIAL AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEGROES
</h5>

<p>
45. In view of the limited field of employment within which Negroes are
restricted we recommend that employers in all lines enlarge that field and permit
Negroes an equal chance with whites to enter all positions for which they are
qualified by efficiency and merit. In this connection especial attention is
called to the fact that opportunity is generally denied to Negroes for gaining
experience in business methods through service in responsible positions in
business houses. Such opportunities, if made available for them, would not
only be of benefit to Negroes in the development of sounder business methods
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_648' name='Page_648' href='#Page_648'>648</a></span>
among them and the building up of their resources, but would also be a gain
to the business establishments and the community at large.
</p>

<p>
46. We have found that Negroes are denied equal opportunity with
whites for advancement and promotion where they are employed. As a
measure of justice we urge that Negroes be employed, advanced, and promoted
according to their capacities and proved merit. We call to the attention of
those concerned the high qualifications of many Negro workers in sleeping-car
and dining-car service, and recommend that when they deserve it and the
opportunity offers, they be made eligible for promotion to positions as conductors
and stewards.
</p>

<h5>
TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT OF NEGROES AS STRIKE BREAKERS
</h5>

<p>
47. We point out as an injustice and a cause of racial antagonism the
practice of some employers who having hired Negroes as strike breakers discharge
them when the strike is settled to make places for former white
employees.
</p>

<h5>
NEGRO WOMEN WORKERS
</h5>

<p>
48. We find that employment of Negro girls at a smaller wage than white
girls and the denial to them of apprenticeship opportunities are a cause of racial
antagonism. We therefore recommend that the employment of Negro girls
be based on merit, with equality of wages, piece rates, and apprenticeship
opportunities with white girls; we also recommend that Negroes in domestic
employment rendering the same quality of service as whites be paid at the same
rate as white domestics.
</p>

<h5>
RACIAL PEACE IN INDUSTRY
</h5>

<p>
49. Realizing that the common welfare is involved in the employment or
non-employment of Negro workers, and seeking means to preserve racial peace
in industry, we recommend: (<i>a</i>) that where Negro employees are dismissed
for unsatisfactory service other Negroes, recommended by reliable Negro
organizations, be given an opportunity to replace them; (<i>b</i>) that in times of
industrial depression, employers reduce their forces in such a manner that the
hardships of unemployment may not be disproportionately severe on Negro
workers; (<i>c</i>) that where Negroes are employed with whites at the same tasks
they be given equal pay for equal work and equal opportunity for piecework
and overtime work; (<i>d</i>) that Negro workers be given opportunity for advancement
and promotion according to merit and efficiency and without race
discrimination; (<i>e</i>) that Negro workers be afforded the opportunity to learn
and engage in the skilled processes of their employment; (<i>f</i>) that superintendents
closely supervise the relations of foremen with Negro workers and see
that there is no racial injustice or discrimination; (<i>g</i>) that employers generally
deal with Negroes, whether engaged in, or seeking opportunity to engage in,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_649' name='Page_649' href='#Page_649'>649</a></span>
manual labor or clerical work, without discrimination as to race, and apply
to them the same tests and conditions as to white employees.
</p>

<h5>
SEPARATE LABOR UNIONS
</h5>

<p>
50. We strongly condemn the efforts of self-seeking agitators, Negro or
white, who use race sentiment to establish separate unions in trades where
existing unions admit Negroes to equal membership with whites.
</p>

<h4>
To Negro Workers:
</h4>

<h5>
RELATIONS WITH UNIONS
</h5>

<p>
51. We recommend that qualified Negro workers desiring membership
in labor organizations join unions which admit both races equally, instead of
organizing separate Negro labor unions.
</p>

<h5>
RELATIONS WITH EMPLOYERS
</h5>

<p>
52. We recommend that Negroes completely abandon the practice of
seeking petty advance payments on wages and the practice of laying off work
without good cause.
</p>

<h5>
LEARNING TRADES
</h5>

<p>
53. We recommend that Negroes avail themselves wherever possible of
opportunities in apprentice schools and classes.
</p>

<p>
54. We recommend to all Negroes dependent on manual labor the learning
of some skilled trade even though there is no present opportunity to engage
in it.
</p>

<h4>
To the Street-Car Companies:
</h4>

<h5>
PROTECTION OF PASSENGERS
</h5>

<p>
55. In view of the large number of racial assaults on persons riding in
street cars, we recommend that conductors and motormen be specially instructed
concerning protection of passengers, white and Negro, and be rigidly
held to the discharge of this duty.
</p>

<h5>
OVERCROWDING
</h5>

<p>
56. We recommend that at all loading-points where whites and Negroes
board cars in large numbers, starters be employed and overcrowding be prevented
as far as possible.
</p>

<h4>
To Restaurants, Theaters, Stores, and Other Places of Public Accommodation:
</h4>

<h5>
EQUAL RIGHTS IN PUBLIC PLACES
</h5>

<p>
57. We point out that Negroes are entitled by law to the same treatment
as other persons in restaurants, theaters, stores, and other places of public
accommodation, and we urge that owners and managers of such places govern
their policies and actions and their employees accordingly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_650' name='Page_650' href='#Page_650'>650</a></span>
</p>

<h4>
To the Press:
</h4>

<h5>
HANDLING OF NEWS INVOLVING NEGROES
</h5>

<p>
58. In view of the recognized responsibility of the press in its general
influence upon public opinion concerning Negroesâ€”especially important as
related to the suppression of race riotingâ€”we recommend: (<i>a</i>) that the newspapers
generally, including the foreign-language press, apply the same standards
of accuracy, fairness, and sense of proportion, with avoidance of exaggeration,
in publishing news about Negroes as about whites; in this connection special
attention is called to the fact that emphasis, greatly out of proportion to that
given their creditable acts, is frequently placed on the crimes and misdeeds
of Negroes, who, unlike other groups, are identified with each incident and
thus constantly associated with discreditable conduct; (<i>b</i>) that the manner of
news treatment be no different in the case of Negroes than in that of whites,
to the end that there shall always be the unwritten assumption that the same
responsibility for equal consideration of the rights of the one by the other
rests on whites and Negroes alike, in respect of the matter involved in the
publication; (<i>c</i>) that, in consideration of the great ease with which the public
is influenced against the whole Negro group by sensational articles and headlines,
the press should exercise great caution in dealing with unverified reports
of crimes of Negroes against white women, and should avoid the designation
of trivial fights as race riots; (<i>d</i>) that in recognition of the dangers of racial
antagonism on the part of the ignorant, the unthinking, and the prejudiced of
both races, publication be made, as opportunities offer, of such matters as shall
in their character tend to dispel prejudice and promote mutual respect and
good will.
</p>

<p>
We specially recommend more frequent publications concerning: (1) creditable
achievements of consequence by Negroes; (2) their efforts toward a
higher cultural and social life, and (3) their improvement of the physical
conditions of their own communities; (4) the common obligation of all citizens
of all races to recognize in their interrelations the supreme duty of strict obedience
to the law, in spirit as well as in deed; (5) verification, so far as practicable,
of all news concerning Negroes and their activities by reference to recognized
Negro agencies or responsible representative Negroes.
</p>

<p>
We further recommend the capitalization of the word "Negro" in racial
designation, and avoidance of the word "nigger," as contemptuous and needlessly
provocative.
</p>

<h5>
HANDLING OF NEWS INVOLVING NEGROES AND WHITES
</h5>

<p>
59. To the Negro press we recommend greater care and accuracy in
reporting incidents involving whites and Negroes, the abandonment of sensational
headlines and articles on racial questions, and more attention to educating
Negro readers as to the available means and opportunities of adjusting themselves
and their fellows into more harmonious relations with their white
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_651' name='Page_651' href='#Page_651'>651</a></span>
neighbors and fellow-citizens, and as to the lines of individual conduct and
collective effort which will tend to minimize interracial friction, promote
their own social and economic development, and hasten interracial adjustment.

Mob of 300 or 400 white people, all ages, attacked east-bound Forty-seventh Street car,
pulled the trolley from the wire, stopped the car. White passengers alighted, Negro passengers
hid under seats. From twenty-five to fifty white men boarded car and beat the
Negroes with bats, clubs, bricks. Driven out from the refuge of the car, they ran for their
lives, chased by the mob. Mills ran from Forty-seventh Street into Normal Avenue. A
brick hit him in the back, halted him, and before he could run again a young white man hit
him on the head with a scantling. He was left unconscious. Four other Negroes from this
car were beaten but not fatally.

Goodman, with other Negroes was returning from the Stock Yards on an east-bound
Thirty-ninth Street car. A truck stalled across the track at Thirty-ninth Street and Union
Avenue brought the car to a stop and allowed white men to force an entrance through the front
door and beat the Negroes off the rear of the car. The chief weapon was the iron lever used for
opening the front door of the car. The Negroes tried to run east to Halsted Street where
there were police officers. The crowd pursued, knocked Goodman down, and beat him.
Apparently Goodman recovered from the violence, but a week later it was necessary to remove
him to the hospital, where a skull fracture, with a small pebble imbedded in the wound, was
discovered. He died of tetanus on August 12. The wound was first treated by Dr. William
W. Bradley on the evening the deceased was injured. The coroner's jury said, "Tetanus
would probably not have developed had the wound been thoroughly examined and properly
cleaned."

white people armed with clubs and bricks. Taylor was found unconscious on the sidewalk,
his watch and suitcase missing, when the police arrived. He died August 1.

Hardy was the only Negro passenger on a north-bound Cottage Grove Avenue car crowded
with white people. At Forty-seventh Street some of these alighted. A mob of whites in the
street saw the Negro and jerked the trolley from the wire. The car came to a stop at Forty-sixth
Place. White passengers in a panic demanded to be let off. When the front door was
opened Hardy tried to hide in their midst and leave the car. He was seen by the waiting mob,
knocked down, and pounded with fists until unconscious. He died the next day.

Several accounts have been given of the killing of Simpson. The coroner's jury says:
"... Thirty-first Street near the said elevated station, being well filled with a rioting and
disorderly mob, mainly colored people, a white man being pursued east on Thirty-first Street,
at that time, and that deceased was a police officer of the City of Chicago, and was engaged
as a police officer in preserving the peace in and about the point indicated, and that a number
of shots were fired from revolvers held in hands of men unknown to this jury." Another
account says Simpson was shot by the Negro keeper of a poolroom on account of a previous
quarrel. Simpson did not regain consciousness after being shot.

The bullet which caused Baker's death was one of a number fired on the streets at the
time. Baker was not on the street but in a second-story window. It is not known whether
this shot was one fired by white men from a passing automobile or by one of a crowd of Negroes
at Thirty-seventh Street and Vincennes Avenue. The majority of witnesses gave the time
of the shooting of Baker as 11:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, but the coroner in his report names 10:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> as the hour.

Only one eyewitness, a white companion of Marcus, testified. He said a Negro walked
up to Marcus and shot him. The witness stopped to pick up his friend, was advised by
Negroes to get out of danger, but when he persisted in lifting the wounded man, he himself
received a bullet wound in the arm. A bullet also pierced the window of a laundry at this
time. The coroner gives the time of shooting as 8:45, though most of the testimony seems
to indicate that it occurred about fifteen or twenty minutes after the first shooting from
automobiles which occurred at approximately 9:15 to 9:30. The police report gives 10:45
as the hour.

Temple, owner of a laundry at the above address, left his place of business to enter his
automobile which stood at the curb. His wife and another young woman accompanied him
but were the width of the sidewalk from him when he was attacked by three Negroes, robbed,
and stabbed. The murderers escaped in the crowd of Negroes which immediately gathered.
It was testified that Temple employed both Negroes and whites and had never had any
difficulties of a racial nature with his workers.

A mob of about 500 Negroes at Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash Avenue was stopping
cars, beating white people, and throwing bricks. An automobile bearing Otterson as a passenger
turned from Thirty-fifth Street to go south on Wabash Avenue. One of the stones
and bricks hurled at the motor car hit Otterson on the head, and he immediately became unconscious.
He was seventy-four years old and a plasterer by trade.

Samuel Bass, on account of the street-car strike, was walking the five and one-half miles
from his work to his home when a gang of white men knocked him down three times, and
cut gashes in his nose and cheeks with their shoes. Bass hid behind freight cars till a Jewish
peddler took him in his cart to State Street. A doctor was visited, but when he learned that
Bass had no money, he turned him away without treatment. He was picked up by a passing
patrol and taken to the hospital, where his treatment was cursory. Apparently he recovered,
but in two weeks gave evidence of a hemorrhage on the brain from which he died September 5.

Lovings, returning home from work on a bicycle, rode through an Italian neighborhood
whose residents were much excited because it had been said earlier in the evening that a Negro
employee of a mattress factory near-by had shot a little Italian girl. A mob filled the streets
when Lovings was sighted. He tried to escape by running down an alley between Taylor and
Gilpin streets, and then jumped back fences and hid in a basement. The mob dragged him out,
riddled his body with bullets, stabbed him, and beat him. It was afterward rumored that his
body had been burned after being saturated with gasoline. This was proved not to be true.

Scott, Brown, and Simpson, Negroes, were returning by street car from work in the
Stock Yards when the car was boarded by a mob of white men who attacked the Negroes with
clubs and bricks. Scott defended himself with a pocketknife, while Kleinmark tried to beat
him with a club. One of the blows with the knife went home, and Kleinmark staggered from
the car mortally wounded. Scott was jailed and charged with murder. The coroner's jury
commented as follows: "It is the sense of this jury that the conduct of the police at the time
of the riot at this point, during the subsequent investigation, and at the preliminary hearing
at which Joseph Scott was bound over to the grand jury without counsel, was a travesty on
justice and fair play."

Metz was one of an assaulting party of whites which roamed the streets from Forty-third
to Forty-seventh streets and from Grand Boulevard to Cottage Grove Avenue on the night
of the twenty-eighth. Three Negroes, one of them Lieutenant Washington, U.S.A., were
returning from a theater with three Negro women by way of Forty-third Street. At the
place mentioned they were attacked by a mob of whites and beaten with fists and clubs.
One of the Negroes was shot in the leg. Lieutenant Washington, threatened with an ax
handle, defended himself with his pocketknife. Metz was stabbed as a result. The coroner's
jury said: "We find that the group of colored people, en route to their home, were acting in an
orderly and inoffensive manner, and were justified in their acts and conduct during said affray."

This shooting occurred just inside the Negro neighborhood near Ogden Park. One of the
numerous mobs threatening this neighborhood began to move into it from Fifty-ninth and
Sixtieth streets and Racine Avenue. The vanguard, composed of young boys, went a few
feet inside the Negro area and fired directly at a Negro named Samuel Johnson. He returned
the fire with a rifle. Other Negroes also fired in the direction of the boys. One of the latter,
Odman, was fatally wounded. The coroner's jury said: "We believe and find that the action
of Samuel R. Johnson was fully justified and recommend his discharge from police custody."

Avenue, whence they had chased Officer Callahan, supposed to have refused to arrest the
alleged slayer of Eugene Williams. Other policemen attempting to disperse the mob were
assaulted. James Crawford, Negro, fired a revolver directly into the group of policemen.
They retaliated and Crawford ran. A Negro policeman followed Crawford, attempting to
stop him by firing. Crawford was wounded and died on July 29. The coroner's jury asserted:
"We further find that the shooting was justifiable on the part of the police officer."

Sullivan, but this was not substantiated. The coroner's jury said: "We are of the opinion

The Angelus riot centered at the intersection of Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash Avenue,
the location of the Angelus apartment house, occupied at the time by whites; Thirty-fifth
Street was crowded all the way to State Street. It was at Thirty-fifth and State streets that
a secondary riot occurred, an aftermath of the Angelus riot, yet almost simultaneous with it.
The crowd of Negroes on these corners had been growing during the afternoon, and stone-throwing
had been prevalent. The rumor which raised the mob to riot pitch was that a Negro
boy had been shot by a white tenant of the Angelus building. A search by the police failed to
produce a culprit. By eight o'clock a mob of about 1,000 to 1,500 Negroes massed on the
streets. To cope with the mob were between sixty to 100 policemen on foot and about twelve
mounted officers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_662' name='Page_662' href='#Page_662'>662</a></span>
</p>

<p>
About eight o'clock a Negro either threw some missiles or fired a shot at a policeman.
Immediately there followed a massing of the police at the north of the intersection of the
two streets. Evidence of an order to fire was not produced, but simultaneously with the massing
came a volley. During this fire Sanford and Taylor were killed while trying to escape
into the entrance of the Angelus building. Shots followed at Thirty-fifth Street and the "L,"
where a large number of the Negroes ran for protection. Several were wounded, and Humphrey
was killed. Almost at the same time shots were fired at Thirty-fifth and State streets,
where Lee received his death wound.
</p>

<p>
The Lee case is the only one in which suspicion of deliberate shooting rested upon anyone.
Atrus Lee, brother of the deceased, accused Mounted Policeman Brooks of firing directly at
his brother. Brooks said that shots were fired at him from north of the intersection, and that
he fired in the air and ran east. Drs. Anderson and Teffner, white, who saw the shooting from
Dr. Anderson's office windows, bore him out. The corner's jury concluded: "We find that
deceased was wounded by one of the shots fired at Officer Brooks."

Schoff, walking on Ashland Avenue, accosted Jose Blanco repeatedly, "Are you a Negro?"
Receiving no response he swung at Blanco with his fist. The latter stabbed Schoff under the
heart, then walked on. As he was about to enter the house of a friend the police arrested him.
He admitted that he had stabbed a man, but said he had done it in self-defense. The coroner's
jury reported: "We, the jury, are unable to agree as to whether the accused, Jose Blanco,
should be held to the grand jury upon a charge of manslaughter.... We recommend
that the coroner present this evidence to the grand jury for consideration and determination."

At 11:00 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, July 30, three policemen patrolling State Street at Twenty-eighth Street,
heard a shot on Dearborn Street. At Twenty-sixth Place they met about a dozen Negro ex-soldiers
acting as police reserves under doubtful orders and asked them to accompany them.
They all went into Dearborn Street. Sixteen-year-old Sam Banks saw them and ran for refuge,
dodging under the house steps at 2729. His running was taken as evidence of guilt. The
officers halted in front of the house. One Francis, a Negro, also believing that because the
boy ran he was guilty, opened his door and pointed out the hiding-place of young Banks.
The boy ran into the passageway between the houses. A shot fired by one of the officers
took effect. Suspicion rested upon Patrolman O'Connor of the Police Department and two
of the ex-soldiers, Adams and Douglas. The coroner's jury stated: "The jury is unable to
determine whether one or more individuals of the group was acting criminally and is not able
to determine which individual fired the shot.... We find that two of said volunteers,
Ed. Douglas and Charles Adams, are held on a charge of murder in connection with the death
of deceased. We find there is evidence of the presence of Ed. Douglas, but no satisfactory
evidence of the presence of Charles Adams at the scene of the shooting. We recommend
the discharge of Charles Adams from police custody on the charge of murder."

A gang of Negro boys passing 2920 South State Street saw the white man and came back.
A Negro, one Partee, was sitting outside the store. He warned the watchman to get inside.
Almost immediately shots were fired. The only person injured was young Copling, who
apparently was not in the crowd but on the outskirts as a sightseer. Suspicion rested upon
four personsâ€”Baker, Negro, leader of the gang; Partee, Negro, who warned the watchman
and was opposed to the gang; Torcello, white watchman; and Graise, Negro, step-father of
Copling, who had on previous occasions threatened to kill the boy because of disagreements
between them. The coroner's jury said: "We recommend that the said Hanson Baker, and
the said Norman Partee, and the said Dan Torcello, and the said Louis Graise be held to the
grand jury on a charge of murder until discharged by due process of law."

The coroner's jury report said: "We find that deceased, in company with several other
young men, was at Forty-seventh Street and Forrestville Avenue when they were ordered to
move away by a police officer and that they obeyed and were walking east; that the group
were followed by one Edgar D. Mohan, a soldier, armed with a rifle, bayonet fixed; that said
Mohan commanded the young men to move faster, accompanying the command by twice
stabbing and wounding one Thomas J. Fennessey in the right hip and scrotum; and that he
immediately after plunged the bayonet into the back of deceased, the bayonet penetrating
through the body. We recommend that the said Edgar D. Mohan be held to the grand
jury upon a charge of manslaughter, until discharged by due process of law.
</p>

<p>
"Being informed by the attorney general of Illinois that the military authorities of the
state of Illinois have jurisdiction over acts of the said Edgar D. Mohan while in the military
service, and have in fact assumed jurisdiction, a court martial being now in progress, we, the
jury, hereby amend the last paragraph of our verdict of September 12, 1919, to read that
'Edgar D. Mohan be held to a court martial' instead of 'Edgar D. Mohan be held to the
grand jury.'" The court martial exonerated Mohan.
</p>

<p>
Statements made in the office of the state's attorney show that Flemming was implicated
in attacks in the neighborhood upon Negroes earlier in the riot period and was known as the
leader of an unruly group who made a certain poolroom their hangout.

The defendants were four Negro boys, Charles Johnson, eighteen; Frank Coachman,
sixteen; John Green, fourteen; and Walter Colvin, sixteen. Lazzeroni, a sixty-year-old
Italian peddler, driving a banana wagon on State Street, was pursued by boys throwing stones
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_664' name='Page_664' href='#Page_664'>664</a></span>
who overtook him, jumped on his wagon, and stabbed him with pocketknives. All except
Johnson were alleged to have confessed, and the confessions were given before the grand jury
by Policeman Deliege as he remembered them. They were not read. The boys who confessed
implicated the one who did not, Johnson. Mrs. Dolly Herrmann identified all of the
boys as being implicated.
</p>

<p>
The four boys were indicted and tried and on September 19, 1919, a verdict of guilty
was rendered against Colvin and Johnson. They were sentenced to the penitentiary for
life on December 17, 1919; the cases of Green and Coachman were stricken off with leave to
reinstate.

A Negro, William Henderson, was walking west on Root Street on the morning of July 29
going to work at the Stock Yards. He was overtaken by another Negro whom he did not
know, but who accompanied him down the street. As they crossed Emerald Avenue they
were met by two white men walking east. One of these was Joseph Powers. He walked
slightly behind the other white man, whose identity was never discovered. It was not known
whether Powers was with this man or not. As the unknown white man passed the two
Negroes he struck out at them. The unknown Negro walking with Henderson struck back,
evidently with a knife in his hand, and hit Powers, who was then abreast of the group, mortally
wounding him. All the participants ran except Powers. Henderson was the only one overtaken.
He was chased through alleys and brought down with stones and bricks and severely
beaten. From the description of the second Negro given by Henderson, and the fact that
another had been found wounded near this spot, it was supposed at first that the second man
was one Henry Renfroe. The coroner's jury said: "We believe that William Henderson was
guilty of no wrong doing, and that if the unknown colored man should prove to be Henry
Renfroe, that he was acting in self-defense. We recommend their immediate discharge from
police custody. We further recommend that the white men guilty of assault on William Henderson
and his companion be apprehended and punished."
</p>

<p>
Later Judge Tate, Negro, was identified as the companion of Henderson. Both Negroes
were indicted by the grand jury. On December 13, 1919, a verdict of not guilty was returned
against Tate and the case of Henderson was nolle prossed.

The same three defendants appear in both these cases, three young Negro boys, Ben
Walker, William Stinson, and Charles Davis.
</p>

<p>
There were no eyewitnesses in either case except the defendants involved, and they did
not appear in person before the coroner's jury, but statements by them were either read or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_665' name='Page_665' href='#Page_665'>665</a></span>
repeated by officials in charge. Davis and Stinson declared that Walker shot Parejko.
When the statements were read to Walker, who had so far refused to make a confession, he
said Stinson stabbed Perel.
</p>

<p>
Parejko and his friend Josef Maminaki, laborers on the Grand Trunk Railway, were
going to work. According to Stinson the boys were sitting on a bread box in front of a store
when they saw the two white men. Walker said, "Let's get this guy." Stinson answered,
"Not me." Walker said, "Stand aside now, boys; I will do my stuff." He fired and Parejko
was mortally wounded and Maminaki slightly wounded. Walker denied the shooting.
However, he told where the weapon could be found, and it was brought before the coroner
as evidence.
</p>

<p>
Perel was walking to his place of business going west on Fifty-first Street. Near Dearborn
Street four or five Negro men or boys jumped on him and stabbed him. When he
was found, it was discovered that his gold watch had been forcibly severed from the chain
and was missing. Someone said a crowd of boys had been seen running south. According
to the statement of Ben Walker, "Fat Stinson jumped on him and stabbed him and hit him
with a club at the same time.... After he stabbed and hit him the whole gang jumped on
him." Afterward Stinson is reported by Walker to have said, "I surely hit that guy," and to
have displayed a pearl-handled knife.
</p>

<p>
The coroner's jury said in the Parejko case: "We recommend that the said Ben Walker,
the said William Stinson, and the said Charles Davis be held to the grand jury upon a charge
of murder until discharged by due process of law." In the Perel case the jury said: "We
recommend that the said William Stinson be held to the grand jury upon a charge of murder
until discharged by due process of law."
</p>

<p>
They were indicted by the grand jury, and on January 9, 1920, a verdict of not guilty
was returned in each case.

Harold Brignadello was one of a crowd of white men who wandered south on State Street
and halted at No. 1021 and stoned the house. It was not brought out whether the stone-throwing
was done because Negroes lived in the house, or was provoked by taunts from Negroes
in the second-story window. A Negro woman and two men appeared at the window, and when
the throwing did not stop, the woman raised her arm. A shot was fired into the crowd,
fatally wounding Brignadello. Police officers found in the flat and arrested Emma Jackson,
Kate Elder, John Webb, Ed Robinson, and Clarence Jones. The coroner's jury recommended
that they be held to the grand jury upon a charge of murder until discharged by due process
of law, and that members of the unknown white mob be apprehended. The five Negroes
named were indicted, and on September 20, 1919, a verdict of not guilty was returned as to
each.

Wilkins, an agent for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, on his rounds collecting,
entered the house at 3825 Rhodes Avenue where several Negro families live. While he was
inside three young Negro men approached one of the tenants who was sitting on the front
porch, and one of them asked who the white man was. This youth is alleged to have said,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_666' name='Page_666' href='#Page_666'>666</a></span>
"We don't want no damned insurance man here. What money we have got we want to keep
it." When Wilkins appeared, two of the youths stood on the curb, and one went between two
houses which Wilkins had to pass. As he went by he was shot. It was said that Spurgeon
Anthony and Willis Powell were the two who stood at the curb, and John Washington was the
one who went between the houses. The coroner's jury recommended that the three be held
to the grand jury upon a charge of murder, and the grand jury indicted them. On December
16, 1919, a verdict of not guilty was returned as to Powell, and Washington was found guilty
and sentenced to twenty years in the penitentiary.

A mob of white civilians, soldiers, and sailors, who had been chasing Negroes through the
"Loop" district for the previous two or three hours, beating and robbing them, and destroying
property where Negroes were not found, entered one of Thompson's restaurants where Hardwick
was breakfasting. Another Negro, one King, was also in the restaurant. The mob set
upon them, throwing food and dishes. Hardwick dodged into the street and King hid behind
a dish counter, where he was wounded with a knife. Failing to catch Hardwick as he fled down
Adams Street, one of the rioters stepped to the curb and fired a revolver at him, bringing him
down. Several of the crowd robbed the corpse. At the time of the coroner's jury hearing
the only one of the mob identified was Ray Freedman, aged seventeen. He was apprehended
and charged with murder, malicious mischief, and inciting to riot, but was not indicted.
Later Edward Haines was connected with the case, indicted, and on February 21, 1920, sent
to Pontiac.

The murder of Williams was the second riot killing in the heart of Chicago's business
district on the morning of July 29. Before Williams died he said he had been assaulted by
white men at State and Van Buren streets. An eyewitness, a Negro, said he saw Williams
running west on the car track on Van Buren Street, followed by a mob of about 200 white
men. One of them, whom he positively identified as Frank Biga, stabbed the deceased twice,
but Williams continued to run for a distance after that. A white man who saw Williams
picked up at Harrison and State streets also identified Biga as a man who all during the
morning had led gangs chasing Negroes. A woman went to a policeman and pointed out
Biga as the leader of riot mobs. The coroner's jury recommended that Biga be held to the
grand jury upon a charge of murder. At the time of the identification of Biga by the woman
the policeman arrested him, found a broken razor in his possession, and had him booked for
disorderly conduct, for which he was fined $5 and costs in the boys' court and sent to the
House of Correction. The next day he broke out of the House of Correction and was not
again apprehended until he was implicated in the murder of a shoe merchant, Fred Bender, on
August 8, 1919. He killed Bender with a blow on the head from an iron pipe. On February
18, 1920, Biga was sent to the penitentiary for life.

Dozier, Negro, approached a meat curer employed in the superintendent's office of Swift
&amp; Co. to ask if the Negroes were not going to have protection in the Yards that morning. A
white worker stepped out of the crowd and struck at Dozier with a hammer. Dozier dodged
and caught the blow on the neck. He started to run east on Exchange Avenue. As he ran
he was struck with a street broom and shovel and other missiles; near the sheep pens a brick
felled him. The meat curer above mentioned and an assistant identified one Zarka as the
man who wielded the hammer. Joseph Scezak was identified as the man who used the broom.
The coroner's jury recommended that these two be held to the grand jury on a charge of manslaughter
and also that the unknown participants be held upon the same charge. Zarka
and Scezak were indicted for murder, and on May 6, 1920, a verdict of not guilty was returned
as to each.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
